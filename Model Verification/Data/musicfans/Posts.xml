According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mastering&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;, the principle processes of mastering are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Editing minor flaws.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Applying noise reduction to eliminate clicks, dropouts, hum and hiss.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adjusting stereo width.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adding ambience.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Equalize audio across tracks for the purpose of optimized frequency distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adjust volume.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dynamic range compression or expansion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Peak limit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dither.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The common thread between these processes is that they can be performed on the complete mixed recording, not just on individual tracks of a recording. Because of this, mastering can be performed at any time on any audio source.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the reason why so many works are remastered, the most likely reason is to keep up with new home theater audio formats.

Every time new audio encoding formats become widespread (48kHz at 16bits, 92kHz at 24bits, etc.), your favorite audio source will need to be remastered to sound good in that format.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="31" LastActivityDate="2015-02-24T17:29:14.187" CommentCount="1" />

Think about it from a radio station's perspective. They can only play so many songs in a given time and they want to make sure that they cover as many songs as possible. Assuming no ads (which is very rare) and that all songs played are 5 minutes long, they could only play a total of 12 songs an hour. If instead they were to play songs that were only 4 minutes long they would be able to play 15 songs instead which allows 3 more songs to be played an hour which makes quite a difference in the long run.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another notable reason is that songs themselves typically follow the same pattern (form) of verse,chorus, ect.

Talkies were either presented with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound-on-disc&quot;&gt;sound-on-disc&lt;/a&gt; system or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound-on-film&quot;&gt;sound-on-film&lt;/a&gt; system.  With sound-on-film, the sound literally comes from a track on the film itself that contains the sound information, which was how the sound was able to be synchronized with the pictures in the film.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jazz_Singer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jazz Singer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first feature-length film with synchronized dialog, was released in 1927.  This film featured the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitaphone&quot;&gt;Vitaphone sound-on-disc system&lt;/a&gt;.  Under this system, the film projector and the sound turntable were mechanically linked to provide the synchronization.  These discs were soon called soundtrack discs.  (The discs had better sound fidelity than the sound-on-film systems, which is why they became popular first.  Sound-on-film technology quickly caught up, and by the early 1930's, the movie studios had mostly switched over to sound-on-film.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;track&quot; implies that it is tightly synchronized with all the other tracks.  On multitrack film or tape, you have different sections that are all being recorded/played at the same time in sync with each other, which is what enabled talking films.  In the silent film era, any sound that accompanied the film (whether it was live sound, or recorded music) was not synchronized with the film, so I don't think it is quite accurate to call it a &quot;soundtrack.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="48" LastActivityDate="2015-02-24T18:28:00.700" CommentCount="1" />

Songs that share patterns can be grouped in a genre that describes those patterns. You can find these patterns in any music dynamic: rhythm, speed, progression, key, instrumentation, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You determine the genre of a song by identifying these patterns, and associating them with the description of a genre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, let's create two genres: fast music and slow music. Any music below 120 bpms (beats per minute) is slow music, anything faster belongs to the fast music genre. Listen to X song, count how many beats you heard in a minute, and group it the genre it belongs to. Genres work exactly like this, but with many more associated characteristics.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For another example, let's define two genres. I'll just use over-simplified definitions to make the point clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techno: Little harmonic and melodic movement (if at all). Emphasis in rhythm and percussive instruments. There is small variation through the song (no climax, no distinctive sections, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trance: Both melodic and harmonic movement. Emphasis on bass, and time-based effects like reverb and delay. Sometimes features string-ensemble-like synthesizers (known as pads). There is variation through the song (it has well-defined intro, break-down, climax, and other sections).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Techno and Trance: Loop-based electronic music, based on samplers and synthesizers, carved for the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Listen to this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtMQj2ivc9I&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtMQj2ivc9I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no harmonic movement, with some melodic movement, which repeats through the song. The movement is injected through the timbre of the melody part, and the percussion part. There is little variation through the song, with no distinctive sections. This song is a good fit for our simplified techno definition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now listen to this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8uWlSOMjcQ&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8uWlSOMjcQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is harmonic and melodic movement. It has distinctive sections (intro, break down and start of build up at around 3:50, climax at around 5:30, outro). A lot of reverb and delay is being used. This is a good fit for our Trance genre, even if it doesn't feature pads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's hard to draw an objective link and define a genre objectively, so the genre subject is often a source of debate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since musicians can be very creative, not all songs have a specific and defined genre. Some are a combination of many, others present a new pattern with no associated genre at all (for example, in our fast-slow music example, what do we do with songs that have no evident tempo, or songs with variable speed, or a song that can be described at more than one speed like 80 and 160 bpms?).

Critical bands and their center frequencies are continuous, as opposed to having strict boundaries at specific frequency locations&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;we have many more bands in the lower frequency range&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, low sounds mask higher sounds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a signal can be masked by a sound preceding it, called forward masking, or even by a sound following it, called backward masking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The masking threshold of a signal entering in one ear can be raised by a masker entering in the other ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial location can have a negative effect on masking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about all those in combination, it's clear that the characteristics of the audio we're encoding are going to have a huge influence on the amount of data we can throw away and still keep the result subjectively indistinguishable from the original (or at least, not subjectively &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;). So, even taking account file format and compression algorithm, another huge variable is the song we're encoding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that as a general rule, taking a rough average of the results from the 'unscientific' tests we've read about may give as good an answer to your question as we can hope for without considering a &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; song. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, my personal impressions, for music, on average:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;128Kbps is usually just about good enough to enjoy the song, but is almost always noticeably worse than the original&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;192Kbps is always good enough to enjoy the song, and &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; be indistinguishable from the original (or at least, not subjectively worse). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;320 Kbps is close enough that I'm not putting any money on that I can distinguish it from the original in most cases; (but I would bet I can find some particular tracks where I can).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On yet another personal note : I listen to music through playlists, so I'm not usually aware what file format or bitrate I'm listening to. Sometimes I catch a bit of a song and I think &quot;wow, that sounds good!&quot; and I check the file - very often (85% of the time?) it is lossless or 320kbps; just occasionally it's 192. It's never less. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16" LastEditorUserId="16" LastEditDate="2015-02-28T10:53:47.690" LastActivityDate="2015-02-28T10:53:47.690" CommentCount="2" />

  <row Id="89" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="88" CreationDate="2015-02-25T10:14:59.987" Score="7" Body="&lt;p&gt;On 31 August 1992, &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt; signed a new recording contract with &lt;strong&gt;Warner Bros. Records&lt;/strong&gt; worth a &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; $100 million. Which was more than several pop mega-deals struck earlier: &lt;strong&gt;Madonna&lt;/strong&gt;'s contract with Warners and &lt;strong&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/strong&gt;'s pact with &lt;strong&gt;Sony Music&lt;/strong&gt;, both estimated at $60 million each. The deal was made public on 4 September 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The specifics&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Advances for future releases&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prince's new contract was an extension of his previous contract. The reconfiguration amounted to a &lt;strong&gt;$10 million advance per record&lt;/strong&gt; — twice that of Jackson's and Madonna's $5 million per album — plus a royalty rate of approximately 20 percent (some sources claim 25 percent) — three times his previous percentage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, Prince would only get this $10 million advance if the previous album has sold at least 5 million copies, i.e. it is an advance on sales, basically an interest-free loan, which would have to be paid back to the record label if sales were low — actually, deducted from royalties on older albums. An important clause, because while Prince's 13 albums had sold nearly 53 million, an average of 4.1 million each, a large chunk of that is due to 1984's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purple Rain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, his bestseller at 14.7 million. As a matter of fact, only three of his albums had sold more than 5 million copies, though one of those was his latest album, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diamonds &amp;amp; Pearls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This large advance was regarded as an attempt by Warner Bros. to motivate Prince to invest the same effort into future releases as he'd done for &lt;em&gt;Diamonds &amp;amp; Pearls&lt;/em&gt;: releasing albums less frequently and promoting them heavily via singles, videos and extensive touring. Prince's sales had been inconsistent, especially in the United States; whereas Madonna had never sold fewer than 5 million copies of any recording, Prince's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lovesexy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in 1988 sold less than 1.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Paisley Park Records&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A further &lt;strong&gt;$20 million was used to make Paisley Park Records a joint venture with Warner Bros.&lt;/strong&gt;, which would force Prince to become more involved in the running of the label. Whereas previously Paisley Park Records would simply supply the master recordings to Warners who would then manufacture, distribute and promote the releases, now the label would decide on what to invest in videos and promotional efforts. Warners and Prince would share investments and profits. Some reports also mention &lt;strong&gt;an additional joint venture record label&lt;/strong&gt;, possibly for singles (tentative name: Love).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Publishing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final &lt;strong&gt;$20 million involved another advance, this time by Warner/Chappel music publishers&lt;/strong&gt;. Part of which was a new three-year agreement between Prince's music publishing company, &lt;strong&gt;Controversy Music&lt;/strong&gt;, and Warner/Chappel Music for the handling of his copyrights worldwide. Another agreement would involve Prince and Warners actively looking for new talent. This was cited as the reason why Warner Bros. Records named him a &lt;strong&gt;vice president of artists and repertoire&lt;/strong&gt; and gave him an office in its L.A. headquarters. However, it is assumed that Prince only wanted this position in order to acquire Time Warner stock options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;No signing fee&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Noteworthy is that &lt;strong&gt;Prince did not receive a signing fee&lt;/strong&gt;, unlike Michael Jackson and Madonna.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The reporting&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prince's own entourage &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-04/business/fi-6479_1_warner-bros&quot;&gt;seemed&lt;/a&gt; pleased with the deal:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We are extremely satisfied with the deal,&quot; said &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Davison&lt;/strong&gt;, president of Prince's &lt;strong&gt;Paisley Park Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Prince has been with Warners since 1978. It's nice to know that they still see him as such a valuable asset.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Davison negotiated the pact with Paisley Park Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Jill Wills&lt;/strong&gt; and Los Angeles entertainment attorney &lt;strong&gt;Gary Stiffelman&lt;/strong&gt;. Representatives for Prince and Warner declined to discuss details of the contract, which has been in the works for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the size of the deal was almost immediately &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-05/entertainment/ca-5707_1_warner-bros&quot;&gt;disputed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Not only were key officers at Warner Bros. surprised when Prince's publicists issued a press release Thursday announcing the pact, but they were &quot;dismayed&quot; — in the words of one Warner official — by the claim that it was the biggest deal in record industry history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Without denying the Prince deal is one of the &quot;four or five biggest&quot; in the record industry, insiders claim the total figure is based largely on projected revenue — not guaranteed income.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prince's lawyers &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-05/entertainment/ca-5707_1_warner-bros&quot;&gt;were confident&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Gary Stiffelman, an entertainment attorney at the Los Angeles firm &lt;strong&gt;Ziffren, Brittenham and Branca&lt;/strong&gt;, declined to discuss details of the contract, but dismissed allegations of self-promotion. Stiffelman negotiated the contract for Prince along with Gilbert Davison, president of Paisley Park Enterprises, Prince's Minneapolis record company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fred Goodman &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/01/arts/pop-music-a-man-of-many-talents-and-100-million.html&quot;&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that Prince's lawyers received a phone call from Warner Bros.:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A source involved in the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, says that even Warners executives telephoned Prince's lawyers after the agreement was announced to ask how the contract could be worth so much. One published report put the actual value of the deal closer to $30 million, while others have speculated that the most he can earn is $10 million per album.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prince's lawyer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/01/arts/pop-music-a-man-of-many-talents-and-100-million.html&quot;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; a difference between Prince and other artists:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Mr. Stiffleman also views Prince as unusually prolific. In the time between Michael Jackson's 1987 release of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and last year's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dangerous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, Prince released four albums. &quot;Together, they sold as well as &lt;em&gt;Bad&lt;/em&gt;, and I'd wager they were more profitable,&quot; says Mr. Stiffleman.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jon Bream managed to get an &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20031119025700/http://www.startribune.com/stories/389/40723.html&quot;&gt;on the record response&lt;/a&gt; from a Warner Bros. VP:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It looks like we're giving him the farm. It's a generous deal, but it's a realistic deal as well,&quot; said &lt;strong&gt;Bob Merlis&lt;/strong&gt;, Warner Bros. vice president of publicity. &quot;If his sales continue the way they have for &lt;em&gt;Diamonds and Pearls&lt;/em&gt; (his current album, which has sold 5.8 million copies), we're all going to make money from the deal. If they go up appreciably, obviously he'll make a lot more money.&quot; Merlis would not confirm the amount of the contract, but Prince's managers released some details in a news release Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bream also &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20031119025700/http://www.startribune.com/stories/389/40723.html&quot;&gt;compares&lt;/a&gt; sales figures:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Since 1983, Madonna has made eight albums with combined worldwide sales of 76 million, or an average of 9.5 million each. Her bestseller is 1986's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Blue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, with 17 million. Since 1979, the prolific Prince has released an album a year for Warner Bros. These 13 albums have sold nearly 53 million, or an average of 4.1 million each; his bestseller is 1984's &lt;em&gt;Purple Rain&lt;/em&gt;, 14.7 million. Two of Jackson's four solo albums, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thriller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bad&lt;/em&gt;, have combined sales of 73 million.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19941028&amp;amp;slug=1938328&quot;&gt;&quot;Prince's Contract Tiff Is A Maze Of Numbers&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Richard Harrington in The Washington Post on 28 October 1994&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-05/entertainment/ca-5707_1_warner-bros&quot;&gt;&quot;Just How Princely Is Prince's Deal?&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Chuck Philips in the Los Angeles Times on 5 September 1992&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20031119025700/http://www.startribune.com/stories/389/40723.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Prince's behind-scenes bankability&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Jon Bream in the Minneapolis Star Tribune on 5 September 1992&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/01/arts/pop-music-a-man-of-many-talents-and-100-million.html&quot;&gt;&quot;A Man of Many Talents (and $100 Million?)&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Fred Goodman in the New York Times on 1 November 1992&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19941028&amp;amp;slug=1938328&quot;&gt;&quot;Prince's Contract Tiff Is A Maze Of Numbers&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Richard Harrington in The Washington Post on 28 October 1994&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-04/business/fi-6479_1_warner-bros&quot;&gt;&quot;A King's Ransom for Prince: Artist Signs Record $100-Million Contract With Warner&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Chuck Philips in the Los Angeles Times on 4 September 1992&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ew.com/article/1992/09/18/princes-new-record-deal&quot;&gt;&quot;Prince's new record deal&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Jon Bream in Entertainment Weekly on 18 September 1992&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="129" LastActivityDate="2015-02-25T10:14:59.987" CommentCount="1" />

With fingers down, it is a common apotropaic gesture, by which people seek protection in unlucky situations (It is a more Mediterranean equivalent of knocking on wood). Thus, for example, the President of the Italian Republic, Giovanni Leone, shocked the country when, while in Naples during an outbreak of cholera, he shook the hands of patients with one hand while with the other behind his back he made the corna. This act was well documented by the journalists and photographers who were right behind him, a fact that had escaped President Leone's mind in that moment. In Italy, one can also &quot;touch iron&quot; (tocca ferro) or touch one's nose. Males in Italy and some other countries may grab their testicles when confronted by bad luck; however, this is considered more vulgar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In Peru one says contra (against).

Because of this, on Earth, we only can ever see one side of the moon. The other side of the moon is sometimes referred to as the dark side of the moon, as it is never visible to us. There is much folklore and mythology about the mysterious ‘dark side of the moon.’ In actuality the other side of the moon is lit up just as much as the side we see. The phase of the moon depends on its position relative to the Earth and the sun. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term “lunatic” evolved from the Latin word luna for moon, due to the ancient belief that insanity varied with or was caused by the phase of the moon. No such correlation has been scientifically proven however. This does establish a connection between the moon and madness though, helping us to understand the symbolism of the song. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Waters is essentially stating, if you go mad then “I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon.” The dark side of the moon is something that we never see, but is always there, just on the opposite side. Waters seems to be relating this to madness, implying that it is always there, but invisible, waiting to be exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Waters elaborates further: &quot;The line 'I'll see you on the dark side of the moon' is me speaking to the listener, saying, I know you have these bad feelings and impulses, because I do too, and one of the ways I can make contact with you is to share the fact that I feel bad sometimes.&quot; The ‘dark side of the moon’ can be considered the dark side of ourselves; the side that we try to hide from those around us. Waters is coming out and saying that we all have that side, but we need to keep it in check, or it will take control of us; driving us to madness. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=duNdBgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA38&amp;amp;lpg=PA38&amp;amp;dq=%22speaking+to+the+listener,+saying,+I+know+you+have+these+bad+feelings%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=CJGFbexlhT&amp;amp;sig=k6KRhMDKG-2dx2QzHOE-1fUC3R8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=pPHtVJztMveMsQTEo4DADw&amp;amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22speaking%20to%20the%20listener%2C%20saying%2C%20I%20know%20you%20have%20these%20bad%20feelings%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Roger Waters and Pink Floyd: The Concept Albums&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://alum.wpi.edu/~vamend/general.html&quot;&gt;alum.wpi.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="53" LastEditorUserId="53" LastEditDate="2015-02-25T16:57:35.243" LastActivityDate="2015-02-25T16:57:35.243" CommentCount="1" />

There were many reasons behind this, including &quot;trade secret&quot; (you don't want your competition to have this new process in their hands), and the fear that automatic pitch correction would be seen as foul play (which ended up happening, and still is a source of hot debate). Believe producers claimed for years that they were using a Digitech Talker vocoder pedal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a 1999 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb99/articles/tracks661.htm&quot;&gt;Sound on Sound article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cher's 'Believe' (Dec 1998) was the first commercial recording to feature the audible side-effects of Antares Auto-tune software used as a deliberate creative effect. The (now) highly recognisable tonal mangling occurs when the pitch correction speed is set too fast for the audio that it is processing and it became one of the most over-used production effects of the following years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In February 1999, when this Sound On Sound article was published, the producers of this recording were apparently so keen to maintain their 'trade secret' process that they were willing to attribute the effect to the (then) recently-released Digitech Talker vocoder pedal. As most people are now all-too familiar with the 'Cher effect', as it became known, we have maintained the article in its original form as an interesting historical footnote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Producers Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-Tune#In_popular_music&quot;&gt;noticed that auto-tune could be used as an effect&lt;/a&gt; while working on Believe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;While working with Cher on the song &quot;Believe&quot; in 1998, producers Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling discovered that if they set Auto-Tune on its most aggressive setting, so that it corrected the pitch at the exact moment it received the signal, the result was an unsettlingly robotic tone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the process was &lt;a href=&quot;http://inventors.about.com/od/astartinventions/a/Who-Invented-Auto-Tune.htm&quot;&gt;originally intended to be subtle&lt;/a&gt;, to not be noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Auto-Tunes was designed to be used discretely, and that no one needed to know that any software correction had been applied to vocal tracks. Hildebrand pointed out that there is an extreme setting available in Auto-Tune, the &quot;zero&quot; setting, that is extremely popular and extremely noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cher's Believe used it as an effect, where it is obvious and noticeable, but other artists might have been using it before that with settings that would make it harder to notice (if at all). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The production of that disc began in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Believe_%28Cher_album%29#Background_and_history&quot;&gt;summer of 1998&lt;/a&gt;, auto-tune was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antarestech.com/about/history.php&quot;&gt;released in 1997&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Following the success of Infinity, Dr. Andy next turned his attention to the emerging market for software plug-ins. Drawing again on geophysics-based DSP technology, he developed and introduced MDT (Multiband Dynamics Tool), one of the first successful Pro Tools plug-ins. This was followed by JVP (Jupiter Voice Processor), SST (Spectral Shaping Tool) and, in 1997, Auto-Tune, a program that corrected pitch problems in vocals and other solo instruments. Auto-Tune became an instant phenomenon, firmly establishing Antares (as the company had been renamed) as a developer of truly astonishing products using DSP technology. Auto-Tune quickly became the largest-selling audio plug-in of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Between its release in 1997 and Cher's Believe in October 1998, there is almost no info about it. All I can find is that it was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima/2010/autotune/&quot;&gt;&quot;top secret&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that other productions were using it, but more discretely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Originally intended to correct any sharp or flat notes from a singer’s recorded performance, Auto-Tune quickly became a top secret hit in the music industry. That was until Cher‘s 1998 smash ‘Believe’ exposed exactly what was going on in recording studios across the world, as Hildebrand confirms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“The studios didn’t like to talk about what they were doing, in general. I mean, this was in the fall-out of Milli Vanilli. So they didn’t advertise the fact they were fixing the singer’s pitch, but they did, and they all knew what it sounded like if you set that control to zero. She was just the first to make it public,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because all these, production-wise, the historical roots of auto-tune are not well known. We know of the first mainstream productions that used it as an effect, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ugkg9RePc&quot;&gt;Eifel 65's Blue&lt;/a&gt; (1999) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGBhQbmPwH8&quot;&gt;Daft Punk's One More Time&lt;/a&gt; (2000), but productions using it discretely were not being loud about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="70" LastEditorUserId="70" LastEditDate="2015-02-27T21:54:10.583" LastActivityDate="2015-02-27T21:54:10.583" CommentCount="0" />

Depending on who you ask, this lineage can be traced even further back to the ancient Greeks and &lt;em&gt;ancient Egyptians&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that's a stretch, consider the tradition of Italian opera in the mid 19th century -- the notion of divas showboating and repeating arias at the audience's insistence is well-documented, and into the 18th century we have supervirtuosos such as Franz Liszt and Niccolo Paganini who were known for over-the-top theatrics during their concerts (playing encore after encore, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you go further back in time, a shift starts to happen -- whereas today we see famous musicians in many ways like royalty, the reality of the situation hundreds of years ago was that musicians were exclusively in the &lt;em&gt;employment&lt;/em&gt; of royalty. All this means for the encore is that instead of musicians coming back on stage to please their audiences, musicians are being &lt;em&gt;ordered&lt;/em&gt; to play a piece of music again by &lt;strong&gt;the King&lt;/strong&gt;. One easily-recalled example of this is the famous premiere of Handel's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Music_(Handel)&quot;&gt;Water Music&lt;/a&gt;, which King George I ordered be repeated at least &lt;em&gt;three times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's not forget, also, that the word &lt;em&gt;encore&lt;/em&gt; literally means &quot;again&quot; in French...

And when your audience is royalty, your life effectively depends on you doing what they want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as far as &quot;when did the tradition start?&quot; is concerned, I would argue that for as long as we've had &lt;strong&gt;musicians&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;royalty&lt;/strong&gt; to boss them around, we've had the encore tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="41" LastActivityDate="2015-02-26T03:51:22.473" CommentCount="2" />

Solid colors or pellet mixes can be tossed into a hopper and extruded into biscuits just like black vinyl.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sounds good so far.

The chemical properties of pigmented vinyl just don't sound quite as good as &quot;virgin&quot; black. Blackwell estimates the sound quality is somewhere between 90 and 95 percent of that of a black record--a small enough variation for the average listener to never notice, but enough to turn off serious audiophiles (who are probably the only ones with expensive enough sound systems to hear the difference). The Carl Sagan &quot;Cosmos&quot; pressing, for example, sounded noisier whenever a record player's needle hit a glow in the dark spot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see it's a tiny trade-off, but it might be noticeable by audiophiles.

The song must have a &quot;clearly audible, intelligible, substantive rendition (not necessarily visually presented) of both lyrics and melody, used in the body of the motion picture or as the first music cue in the end credits.&quot;  Under the current rules, a single movie may have no more than two songs nominated.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Song&quot;&gt;(Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ties in voting at the Oscars are possible.

Here's that story:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the time before music printing, and well into it, the vast majority of people didn't know about any music that wasn't being made right in their town or village. And there were very important composers (J.S. Bach is maybe the best example) who were completely obscure outside the city or small court in which they worked. For most of the period from 1000-1700, the Catholic or Protestant church was the main way music was propagated across Europe. Individual church composers (like Josquin or Palestrina) moved around inside the Catholic world, trying to get the best gig, and took their music with them. Meanwhile, Protestant church authorities were interested in publishing new hymns as a kind of evangelism for the new churches they were forming. (The first music book printed in the US was a book of Protestant hymns.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BUT...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A composer like Beethoven had to move to the capital city of the Austrian Empire because that's where a large population of wealthy, cultured, aristocrats lived who would go to his concerts, have their children study with him, and (later) commission works from him and buy his printed music. Some musicians, like Mozart when a child virtuoso, toured like today's rock bands -- Mozart and his family made a number of European tours, which were very complex to arrange, needing the patronage of connected aristocrats to provide entrée to royal courts, etc. Their reputations spread along with them, and for some of them, publishers of sheet music found it worthwhile to print up editions of their more popular compositions, especially piano, vocal, and chamber pieces that amateurs could play. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then these publishers, er, publicized their catalogs, offering the music for sale across Europe through importers and distributors. Some of them subsidized magazines for musical cognoscenti, in which reviews of new works and articles about musical life were published. A number of famous composers (Schumann, Berlioz) wrote for these magazines, and there are several famous articles where, in effect, an established composer says, &quot;hey, check out this new guy!&quot; (Schumann did this for Chopin in Germany (he was a Parisian virtuoso) and for a very young Brahms.) These magazines circulated pretty widely among the middle and upper classes, so, if you were interested, you could keep up with new music that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Publishers also collected &quot;favorite pieces&quot; into albums and sold those. A young girl studying piano in the time of the Jane Austen novels might have bought for her a large bound volume filled with piano solos, easier opera songs, folk songs, and the like, so that she could entertain after dinner from the parlor piano. Some composers got big exposure that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, opera was a huge business in Europe all during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries:  composers of opera like Rossini became genuinely and internationally famous. They wrote their operas to be premiered at and the exclusive property of one opera house for a given season, but if the opera was a success there, other houses across Europe would put it on for their patrons. Rossini was, at the height of his fame in the 1820s and 1830s, famous &quot;from London to St. Petersburg,&quot; and his operas were put on in most major and regional capital cities. Popular arias from his operas were printed and sold as sheet music, and made it into those collections I mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the late 1800s, the combination of movable music type and steam-driven printing presses made sheet music -- for the first time -- cheap enough to be profitable as a mass market item. This was also the period when every middle-class home had some kind of piano in it. By the early 1900s, the music business starts to look like any other business, with manufacturers making large runs of product, distributors pushing the product out to regional markets, and dedicated &quot;music stores&quot; where consumers could browse the shelves for new music to buy. Before there were recordings (and even after), &quot;song pluggers&quot; were hired to go around and play new songs for customers at shops, at theaters and vaudeville houses, even at the new &quot;moving picture&quot; shows, where they sometimes used magic lantern slides to project the words and have sing-a-longs with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then came the record business...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="174" LastActivityDate="2015-03-01T01:28:59.280" CommentCount="0" />
  <row Id="266" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="155" CreationDate="2015-03-01T01:50:30.330" Score="23" Body="&lt;p&gt;I would separate out the idea of &quot;art music&quot; -- or &quot;high music&quot; versus &quot;low&quot; music -- from the specific question of musical &quot;classics.&quot; You can find clear taxonomies of genre from high to low in treatises going very far back in music history, clear back into the late Medieval period. Theorists understood that there was a music that &quot;the people&quot; made, and it was not the same as cultivated church and court music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the notion of &quot;classical&quot; music is only invented, by analogy with the &quot;classics&quot; of Greek and Roman literature, in the mid-1700s, and it really takes hold after the death of Beethoven. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many scholarly works on the &quot;rise of the musical canon&quot;; do an internet search on the research of historian William Weber if you want the full story. Weber identifies what he calls &quot;high-status popular&quot; and &quot;high-status classical&quot; music publics in the major European cities in the 1830s and 1840s. The confusing thing for modern listeners is that, while the &quot;classical&quot; music of that period (Palestrina, Bach, Mozart, Handel, Beethoven) is recognizable as classical music, SO IS THE POPULAR (Rossini, Bellini, Chopin, Liszt) - we've lost this distinction altogether. The other counter-intutitive fact is that the high-status audience for &quot;popular&quot; music was more wealthy than the high-status audience for &quot;classical&quot; music:  the 1% of 1830 patronized Chopin and went to the opera to hear Donizetti, while the intellectuals of the day -- the Volvo-driving, latte drinking, college professor types -- championed Beethoven and older music as more serious and intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You sometimes experience this disconnect at a &quot;classical music&quot; concert today:  a serious, weighty symphony by Beethoven (CLASSICAL) might be accompanied by a flashy (and somewhat trashy) concerto by Chopin (POPULAR). In the middle 19th century, those two pieces would have had two different audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weber also notes that there was, of course, &quot;low-status popular&quot; music and its audience. But that stuff, the ancestor of today's &quot;pop,&quot; didn't leave much trace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS:  Note that I am not &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; saying that the music of Chopin is worth less than that of Beethoven. Just that some people thought it was in 1840. Another irony is that standards of performance were much higher in the high-status popular music world:  the biggest virtuosi were not much interested in playing Beethoven or Mozart, because it wasn't hard enough! (It was only when the classical music ideology really took hold, in the later 19th-ct, that brilliant technicians like Liszt started playing Beethoven and earlier music to show how serious and intellectual they could be, too.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="174" LastEditorUserId="174" LastEditDate="2015-03-03T04:41:54.413" LastActivityDate="2015-03-03T04:41:54.413" CommentCount="1" />

  <row Id="273" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="135" CreationDate="2015-03-01T17:35:25.577" Score="9" Body="&lt;p&gt;Vinyl sound is influenced by how music is carved into it (mastering), the playback mechanism (turntable, stylus, cartridge, electronics, etc), and the characteristics of the medium itself (vinyl).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The meaning of &quot;vinyl sound&quot; is often approached subjectively. Different people have different ideas of what a sound has to have and/or lack to be considered  &quot;vinyl sound&quot;. To answer this question objectively, we can take a look at measurable characteristics and dynamics of the medium.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When people refer to &quot;vinyl sound&quot;, they are most likely referring to one or a combination of the characteristics listed bellow. The importance of each characteristic in the &quot;vinyl sound&quot; definition is the subjective part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low frequencies (bass):&lt;/strong&gt; Low frequencies panned between the left and right channels can knock around the needle, so you'll find low frequencies to be monophonic. Even with centered low frequencies, the record can skip with excessive low end. Because of this, excessive low end is not a feature often found in vinyl.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High frequencies (treble):&lt;/strong&gt; High frequencies and sibilance can cause distortion because the stylus cannot properly track them in the disc's grooves. Because of this, highs might need to be tamed down (reduced, compressed, flattened) for vinyl playback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow and flutter:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow and flutter are a change in frequency of an analog device and are the result of mechanical imperfections, with wow being a slower rate form of flutter. For LP records, the quality of the turntable will have a large effect on the level of wow and flutter. A good turntable will have wow and flutter values of less than 0.05%, which is the speed variation from the mean value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inner and outer portions sound different:&lt;/strong&gt;  The distance around the inside of a 12-inch record is about half the distance than around the outside, as the distance around each revolution decreases, the high frequencies become harder for a playback stylus to read. As a result, the inner tracks will sound duller than the outer tracks. The high frequencies simply can't be reproduced the same as if they were cut on the outside of the disc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surface noise:&lt;/strong&gt; Pops, clicks, crackles. You'll find them even on high-end setups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic range:&lt;/strong&gt; Vinyl microgroove phonograph records typically yield 55-65 dB, though the first play of the higher-fidelity outer rings can achieve a dynamic range of 70 dB. For comparison, 16-bit PCM (CD quality) has a theoretical dynamic range of about 96 dB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIAA curve:&lt;/strong&gt; The RIAA equalization curve allows engineers to overcome certain limitations and maximize the amount of full-frequency music they can get onto a record. The EQ curve is applied as the music is cut into the master lacquer. When a record is played back, the inverse of this EQ curve is applied by the phono preamp so that the listener hears the music as it was intended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because low frequencies require larger grooves and more space on a disc than high frequencies, the EQ curve gradually rolls off the bass by 6 dB per octave starting at 1 kHz so that by 20 Hz, the level has been reduced 20 dB. Without the RIAA bass cut, only about 5 minutes of low-frequency information could be stored per 12-inch side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the RIAA curve boosts the frequencies above 1 kHz to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in the high end. The maximum increase is about 20 dB around 20 kHz. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unless linear-phase filters are used, phase changes will be induced both times the curve is applied (once in reverse), so both the mastering engineer and your turntable are injecting their character into the sound. How audible the change is depends on the filters used, some high-end systems aim for as little change as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The RIAA curve can affect the sound in other ways. Pete Lyman stated that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all the high end we're now used to is aggravated by the RIAA curve. When they came up with this system, there wasn't much going on above 8 and 10 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonlive.com/music/index.ssf/2014/11/does_vinyl_really_sound_better.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.record-producer.com/should-you-pan-low-frequency-instruments#.VPM_0LOG-QM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_analog_and_digital_recording&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100727174542/http://emusician.com/tutorials/mastering_vinyl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100801092851/http://emusician.com/tutorials/mastering_vinyl/index1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="70" LastEditorUserId="70" LastEditDate="2016-06-10T10:13:21.210" LastActivityDate="2016-06-10T10:13:21.210" CommentCount="0" />

This would have been the predominant way that folk music, as opposed to art music or sacred music, was passed about. This is why a lot of folk tunes have a number of different versions relating to different places the tune had passed though (an old fashioned version of remixing, maybe?). Performers themselves would also travel far and wide, in the tradition of the &quot;wandering minstrel&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for passing on knowledge about art music - while it's true that there wasn't the radio or youtube, families with the money to purchase instruments would do so as they were one of the relatively fewer ways you could have some fun at home. With those instruments would come lessons which would pass around the knowledge of music repertoire, which would be then become known in that level of society. Likewise, if you were entertaining, chamber music was a form of entertainment designed to work in a room in your house. If you were to go out to see some entertainment, it would often involve some form of musical performance - perhaps a concert or operetta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you just went down to the pub, by the early 19th century, there may well have been  some kind of musical performance going on - these performances would go on to evolve into the music hall and vaudeville traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a more sinister level, sometimes whole populations would move - or be moved - for reasons beyond their control.

Based on photo evidence, he's able to manage to keep a bucket for years. By looking through a timeline of live events, you see the kind of wear that would be expected of a standard cardboard bucket (even if that wear is slower than anticipated).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;1999&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's start with this picture of Buckethead playing live with Primus during Ozzfest in 1999. You can see the rolled up bottom of the bucket has been crimped in places. Exactly like you would expect from a standard cardboard bucket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wxseH.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;buckethead-1999&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;2002&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward to his appearance at the VMAs in 2002, it is definitely a different bucket. The &lt;code&gt;FUNERAL&lt;/code&gt; sticker is lower and not as straight. Again, though, you can see where the rolled cardboard has taken a beating, and is falling apart in places. The same goes for the top of the bucket. You can see dents there, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/cRM9Z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;buckethead-2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;2004&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the comments:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;the one he is currently wearing is most likely some sort of replica or modified in some way to make it more durable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's been modified for durability. &lt;em&gt;By adding a second bucket&lt;/em&gt;. Images from 2004, playing with &lt;em&gt;Giant Robot&lt;/em&gt;, show that Buckethead is still wearing the same bucket from the VMAs, now reinforced with a second bucket underneath. You can also see more damage to the bottom roll.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/rSpCg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;buckethead-2004b&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this top-down angle, you can see the base of the bucket has really seen some damage. Also, note the seam down the side of the bucket. That seems like an unnecessarily small detail to replicate in a faux-bucket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/EatGq.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;buckethead-2004a&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;2006&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He wears the same bucket right up through 2006 at the Vegoose Music Festival where he performed with Praxis. At this point, the bottom roll is almost completely unraveled, the front is taped up, the top is mostly dented in, and it takes &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; buckets to act as reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ryhD1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;buckethead-2006&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;2008&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's at this point that Buckethead switches for a short time to the plain bucket (for unknown reasons). I can't even speculate on what material it is made of, but based on the extra ridges on the bottom, it doesn't look like it's a painted KFC bucket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Brhdh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;buckethead-2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;2012&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2012, he is back to the KFC bucket. You can see the seam running down the right side and the small ridge at the bottom. This matches the original KFC bucket seen from 2002-2006. So, it seems Buckethead has just bought a new one from KFC, and will tour with it as he did the old one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/tcuUR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;buckethead-2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;image attributions:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;1999: &lt;a href=&quot;http://musicartvcl.blogspot.com/2011/01/primus-live-at-ozzfest-polaris.html&quot;&gt;http://musicartvcl.blogspot.com/2011/01/primus-live-at-ozzfest-polaris.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2002: &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2013/08/25/eclectic-fashion-vmas/&quot;&gt;http://mashable.com/2013/08/25/eclectic-fashion-vmas/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2004: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glidemagazine.com/24036/bucketheads-giant-robot-bowery-ballroom-new-york-ny/&quot;&gt;http://www.glidemagazine.com/24036/bucketheads-giant-robot-bowery-ballroom-new-york-ny/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2006: &lt;a href=&quot;http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y130/jayladdin/P1010228.jpg&quot;&gt;http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y130/jayladdin/P1010228.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2008: &lt;a href=&quot;http://swolfy.deviantart.com/art/3-buckethead-national-10-14-08-102803241&quot;&gt;http://swolfy.deviantart.com/art/3-buckethead-national-10-14-08-102803241&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2012: &lt;a href=&quot;http://backbeatseattle.com/?attachment_id=92800&quot;&gt;http://backbeatseattle.com/?attachment_id=92800&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="79" LastActivityDate="2015-03-02T21:42:28.563" CommentCount="3" />

In this piece, many scenes from the natural and civilized world are portrayed with symphonic instruments, such as an organ and various brass instruments playing low pitched notes to represent the catacombs.  The third scene, I pini del Gianicolo, features the song of a nightingale. Rather than conjuring images of a nightingale with a flute, Respighi decided to just cut to the chase and play a recording of a nightingale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although neither Respighi nor his audience could have any idea this performance had broken ground on a technique that would transform music in the 20th Century, this was probably the birth of sampling.

The reason it is called standard, is because it has been recorded many many times, by numerous different artists (and usually in many different kinds of jazz).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to learn how to play jazz, you can find a jazz standard (they go from really easy to really hard) and start to play. The fact that there are many scores and transcriptions by famous artists helps you to see what other people play in the specific song. You can also listen to their recordings, which will help you out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, when musicians don't (musically) know each other, they can start by playing a jazz song that both of them know, which will help them see how the other person thinks/communicates musically, instead of starting composing from the very beginning&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24" LastActivityDate="2015-03-03T12:14:22.667" CommentCount="0" />

  <row Id="324" PostTypeId="5" CreationDate="2015-03-03T14:56:12.867" Score="0" Body="&lt;p&gt;Back in the L.A. club scene of 1984, Izzy Stradlin (of Hollywood Rose) was roommates with Tracii Guns (or L.A. Guns).  L.A. Guns were looking for a new singler, so Izzy suggested the lead vocalist for his band; Axl Rose.  A few other members from both bands joined in, and in March of 1985 &lt;strong&gt;Guns and Roses&lt;/strong&gt; were born, taking the name from a combination of both bands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This lineup lasted only about 3 months, as Axl and Tracii were always at odds.  By June of 1985 the band had the lineup which would release their debut album.  After months of non-stop touring, they were signed by Geffen in March 1986 and released their first EP in December of that year.  &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot;, a collection of demos overdubbed with a canned audience track, was limited to 10,000 copies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The band took off like a rocket with their 1987 release &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot;.  Gone were the club days so quickly, this band were arena headliners from now on.  For a brief 6 years, Guns and Roses burned brighter than any band before, until Axl's attitude caused a complete collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following the Use Your Illusion tour in 1993, with co-headliners Metallica, the band dissipated.  For several years there were no concrete tours or recordings.  Finally, in 1999, Rose re-appeared with a completely different line-up but still under the moniker &quot;Guns and Roses&quot;, pushing an album called &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;.  That album, for many reasons, wouldn't get released until 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2012 the band were inducted into the Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall Of Fame with all original members.

However,&#xA;  on December 5, 1998 the Hot 100 changed from being a &quot;singles&quot; chart&#xA;  to a &quot;songs&quot; chart. During the 1990s, a growing trend in the music&#xA;  industry was to promote songs to radio without ever releasing them as&#xA;  singles. It was claimed by major record labels that singles were&#xA;  cannibalizing album sales, so they were slowly phased out. During this&#xA;  period, accusations began to fly of chart manipulation as labels would&#xA;  hold off on releasing a single until airplay was at its absolute peak,&#xA;  thus prompting a top ten or, in some cases, a number one debut. In&#xA;  many cases, a label would delete a single from its catalog after only&#xA;  one week, thus allowing the song to enter the Hot 100, make a high&#xA;  debut and then slowly decline in position as the one-time production&#xA;  of the retail single sold out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="49" LastEditorUserId="49" LastEditDate="2015-03-05T08:38:18.550" LastActivityDate="2015-03-05T08:38:18.550" CommentCount="2" />

If they only play 5 songs in an hour, the station is less likely to play something a particular listener likes than if they can play 12 songs in an hour.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the songs are 3 minutes long, the station can play 5 songs in 15 minutes and then have 5 minutes of commercials and then do it again.  By playing 5 songs in a 15 minute span instead of two, a given listener is more likely to hear something they like and stay tuned for the next set in case they might hear something else they like.  And &lt;strong&gt;if they don't like a particular song, they know they only have to listen for 3 minutes and anyone can wait 3 minutes.  If they did not like the song and it was a 7 minute song, they are more likely to turn the dial (change the channel).&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the 3 minute rule became an accepted formula among radio station program directors&lt;/strong&gt;.  The &quot;radio cut&quot; of longer songs, shortened them into this radio friendly length. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, if you write a song in hopes that it may get airplay on commercial radio, try to keep it in the 3 minute mark.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="197" LastActivityDate="2015-03-04T05:16:16.637" CommentCount="0" />

I'm also focusing more on some of the 'why', as I agree with Johnny Bones that the 'when' has been more of a slow progression.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronics pt1 - synthesizers and samplers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;From the 70s onwards, synthesizers became increasingly practical to use in the studio and on stage. As we moved forward towards the end of the millennium, they became very cheaply-obtainable due to the advent of virtual instruments, to the point where by the early 2000s anyone with a computer could put together a whole electronic studio on their computer for less than the price of a second-hand guitar and amplifier. This increase in accessibility can be related to the increase in electronic sounds in music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said that, If this was the only technological development, I'm not sure if it would have led to a sea change in the sound of music. A lot of rock groups were flavouring their songs with synthesizer since (to take an arbitrary point) the early 70s, and although a synth (or a sampler) can clearly make sounds that an electric guitar can't, someone sitting at a keyboard playing an electronic sound can be seen as something that's still part of rock tradition. There is one aspect where a sampler in particular can start to disrupt the dynamic of a rock band though : as it's possible to sample sounds or vocal phrases that catch the audience's attention in the same way as a singer would, the singer now has competition...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronics pt2 - sequencing and studio techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;One thing about electronic instruments is you don't have to actually &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; them, and in fact, you can do more with them if you don't. Once you start using a sequencer, you can trigger sequences of notes that would be nearly impossible to play physically; you can program changes to multiple sound parameters that you wouldn't have enough hands to physically control; You can even get the machines to choose your notes for you. The up-side of this is that you can suddenly go way beyond what was possible with physical instruments. The flip side is that the 'live' aspect of the music has gone : even if you have the machines on stage, you may be still essentially just be triggering playback (note that in very recent years, Equipment such as the Ableton program has started to push things back the other way!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As well as instruments, there are many production techniques (auto-tune, time-stretching, reverse reverbs, vocal chop-ups) that can be applied to greater effect when laying down a track in the studio than they can live, so this also shifts music away from being something that is played live on stage to something that's produced in a studio and played back on stage e.g. by a DJ. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DJ and hiphop/club culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Also from the 70s and 80s came the rise of at least two musical movements that were both oriented around DJ culture - Hip Hop, based around DJs and MCs (and mirroring earlier developments in Jamaican music culture to a degree), and House / Techno music. Hip Hop started to use the turntable more as an instrument than a way of playing back a static track, while House / Techno  DJs took advantage of the rhythmically precise nature of the electronic tracks to  beat-match tracks together. In both these cases DJs had elevated themselves from agents of transmission to performers in their own right, providing a rival to the traditional instrumentalist rock-god. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the 90s, the worlds of dance and hip-hop music remained somewhat separate, arguably more cultually than musically. Over the next decade or two, producers have started to take advantage of the fact that hiphop and dance music are stylistically very compatible, and this has led to the development of a hip-hop/dance crossover genre that still seems to have some way to run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future? (Opinion - please Ignore)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;As I mentioned before, part of the reason for instrumental performers being out of the limelight a bit is the fact that the current generation of electronic instruments and processes work so much better in the studio than live. That, in turn, is something that's likely to change, and as electronic instrument interfaces and processing algorithms evolve it's possible that things could go back to being more genuinely live and things might be in some ways a bit more like they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16" LastEditorUserId="16" LastEditDate="2015-03-06T16:28:44.567" LastActivityDate="2015-03-06T16:28:44.567" CommentCount="9" />

If the question is &quot;why is rock music not at the top of the Billboard pop charts?&quot; then I would say it has to do with the shift from a blues based aesthetic of pop music to a gospel and hip-hop based aesthetic. For the last few generations of music consumers, the basic &quot;matrix&quot; within which pop music forms is no longer folk and the blues, with guitars at the center, but soul, gospel, and hip-hop, genres that emphasize looped beats, dance grooves, sampling, elaborate diva-style vocals, and rapping. (I explicitly want to avoid seeming to make a value judgment here; I don't think one is better or more &quot;authentic&quot; than the other.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most new pop music is some combination of these styles, and white guys who might otherwise be rocking -- Ed Sheeran -- and white girls who might have wanted to be like Joni Mitchell -- Iggy Azalea -- are forming their styles on that combination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, new electric guitar music is either super retro and avant-garde (Jack White, St. Vincent) or extremely complex, dark, and avant-garde (metal).

Take for example all of the different keys it can be written in, the many different types of Minor keys (harmonic, melodic, etc.), the instrumentation also has a huge impact on the final result. Different instruments are 'sad' (especially instruments like the Irish Whistle), yet they can be played in a happy manner. I think the single most important thing that influences the mood, is the orchestration/notation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think you can learn a lot about the different emotions associated with various musical forms from film music.&#xA;For example, what is one very consistent attribute of action music? Long floating melodies? Sweet harmonies? No, it is very active, almost haphazard. Intense driving rhythms and fast paced tempos, and tense yet flamboyant melodies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now in a 'sad' scene, where someone has just been buried (or something else like that), the music is very slow and thoughtful, with minor key tonalities to make the music sound mournful. Why does these completely different cases fit perfectly with the scene? I think music is a direct vocalization of the emotions, of behavior even. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Music copies what we do when we are happy or sad, because it is written by and played by people too. When we are excited, we are much more prone to be active, and while we are deeply saddened, everything is slowed, thoughtful. I think that the reason we associate different behaviors with different types of music, is because it reflects that behavior in the timber, tone, tempo, and type, and reminds us of it, quite forcefully. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastActivityDate="2015-03-11T11:46:08.917" CommentCount="0" />

Rather, the styles of soul are often associated with specific labels (Stax, Motown, Atlantic…) or places (Memphis, New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia…) Also, some notable soul musicians started their own record labels, or otherwise developed a community of performers whose music is of the same basic style. (For example, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, Al Green…)  It's also the case that most of the major soul musicians recorded diversely: uptempo and slow music. If you really don't care for the slow stuff, I think you just have to sample around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This may be a case where, rather than searching for genres, you should read up on the history of the music. Articles and books about soul will relate music you already know you like to music you haven't heard yet. From there, you could start a Pandora or Rdio station that would play you lots of related music. Peter Guralnick's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0316332739&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sweet Soul Music&lt;/a&gt; is a great general starting place, especially in line with what you've already indicated you like. It doesn't cover New Orleans or any Northern soul, but what it does it does very well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another angle: this was music from a &quot;singles&quot; era, so there are a lot of compilations, some of which will lead you to specific artists you love. I learned a lot about soul from Rhino's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000003425&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Beg, Scream, and Shout&lt;/a&gt;— it is a great comprehensive introduction to this music. It's out of print, I see it listed used on Amazon for about $70, which is a fair price for a six disc set. I see that some but not all of the volumes are on the iTunes store and Rdio, so you can sample that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some more things you can stream to sample:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdio.com/artist/Various_Artists/album/Stax-Volt_The_Complete_Singles_1959-1968/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Complete Stax/Volt Singles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beg, Scream and Shout &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdio.com/artist/Various_Artists/album/Beg,_Scream__Shout!_Vol._1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vol 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdio.com/artist/Various_Artists/album/Beg,_Scream__Shout!_Vol._2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vol 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdio.com/artist/Various_Artists/album/Beg,_Scream__Shout!_Vol._3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vol 3&lt;/a&gt; (don't see volumes 4,5,6)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdio.com/artist/Various_Artists/album/Soul_Jazz_Records_Presents_New_Orleans_Soul_The_Original_Sound_of_New_Orleans_Soul_1960-76_1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Soul Jazz Presents New Orleans Soul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anything like this is hopelessly incomplete, so while it would be fun to go on, I have to stop. Hopefully it's a starting point. Also, referring back to the kind of gospel you described at the beginning, a record which I love but which isn't on Rdio is &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000002OBQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;None But the Righteous: Chess Gospel Greats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, while an introductory answer has to focus on the best-known artists, there's a lot of other great stuff to hear, and you don't have to dig as hard for it as people did 10 or 15 years ago. There are great labels reissuing overlooked gems from the 60's and 70's (often with a single-city focus). Check out Numero Group's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numerogroup.com/series/eccentric-soul&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eccentric Soul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numerogroup.com/series/good-god&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Good God!&lt;/a&gt; series, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nowagainrecords.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Now Again&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lightintheattic.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Light in the Attic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And there are current artists making new music that ought to be heard.

Many venues didn't accept drums onstage (I think Grand Ole Opry was late 50s and wasn't widely accepted until the 70s).  Drums were though to be part of &quot;black&quot; culture in the US and we are talking about times of segregation.  I am not sure everything was &quot;racist&quot; but there was a line drawn in the sand.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What did the &quot;white&quot; bands do at the time to get around the no drums issue.  Well a lot of them were pop music and didn't worry about percussion.  But as blues, bluegrass, jazz began to mix with traditional pop and country we started several varieties of country and rock and roll.  What did they start doing?   They started playing the drums with their guitar.   There were a few different things they did to get the percussion sound but the easiest thing was to take a piece of brown paper sack or a dollar bill and wrap the chords as the plucked hard.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was Johnny Cash's signature beat in his early days.  Johnny was at Sun Records and a lot of fellow Sun musicians did similar things and the percussion sound of rock and modern country was into the mainstream.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing is during the late 50s and early 60s you had an onslaught of musicians (many through Sun) that gained fame quickly.

This legal standard will likely be challenged on appeal because it deviates greatly from previously established case law.  Prior song copyright cases had used &lt;strong&gt;melody&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lyrics&lt;/strong&gt; as the two decisive factors, either one of which could be sufficient to render a work a copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some examples of successful previous lawsuits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melody&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Beach Boys &lt;em&gt;Surfin' USA&lt;/em&gt; infringing on Chuck Berry's &lt;em&gt;Sweet Little Sixteen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;George Harrison's &lt;em&gt;My Sweet Lord&lt;/em&gt; infringing on The Chiffons' &lt;em&gt;He's So Fine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Michael Bolton's &lt;em&gt;Love Is a Wonderful Thing&lt;/em&gt; infringing on The Isley Brothers' &lt;em&gt;Love Is a Wonderful Thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, previous lawsuits that had claimed infringement due to style, chord changes, or other factors often failed.  A famous example of this is the 1985 lawsuit &lt;em&gt;Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty&lt;/em&gt; where Saul Zaentz of Fantasy Records sued John Fogerty on the grounds that his 1985 solo hit &lt;em&gt;The Old Man Down the Road&lt;/em&gt; sounded similar to the 1970 Creedence Clearwater Revival song (that Fogerty also wrote) &lt;em&gt;Run Through the Jungle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Juries are inherently unpredictable and this particular &lt;em&gt;Blurred Lines&lt;/em&gt; case was further muddied by a counter suit and odd testimony by Robin Thicke that he had been too drunk and high to write &lt;em&gt;Blurred Lines&lt;/em&gt;. Not wanting to rely on a jury's interpretation is why most copyright cases are settled out-of-court.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To my mind, this was the second recent copyright case that marks a disturbing trend.  Tom Petty claimed ownership of a chord progression from &lt;em&gt;I Won't Back Down&lt;/em&gt; and challenged Sam Smith about his song &lt;em&gt;Stay With Me&lt;/em&gt;.  This was settled out of court so is not an official precedent, but a chord progression, like a beat, bass line, tempo, or other song feature, has not previously been held able to be copyrighted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I once heard someone remark, &quot;If you could copyright a bass line or a rhythm pattern, Willie Dixon and Bo Diddley would be as rich as Bill Gates.&quot;  Unfortunately, the law may be shifting in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastEditorUserId="108" LastEditDate="2015-03-18T12:11:01.663" LastActivityDate="2015-03-18T12:11:01.663" CommentCount="2" />

Affordability helped with its popularity, but its sound sealed the deal. It wasn't well received at first because &quot;it was not real enough&quot; (something similar happened with other early synthesizers, like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Theremin&lt;/a&gt;), but as people became more and more used to it, its sound spread through all kinds of music including pop and rock.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was good, it was cheap, and it was everywhere, so its introduction into the mainstream was inevitable. Big names started using it, both live and in the studio. Some notable early adopters include &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Magic_Orchestra&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yellow Magic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Gaye&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Marvin Gaye&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrika_Bambaataa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Afrika Bambaata&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The kick (or bass drum, as labeled in the 808) was and still is one of the most popular features of the instrument. I don't know if it was the first drum machine to use a fast frequency swipe to build a kick sound, but it definitely was the one that popularized it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the reason of the popularity of the 808 kick sound (other than the price and big names using it) is that it just sounds great. It is simple, powerful, flexible, and does an awesome job at doing what a bass drum needs to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what differentiates them from the bass kicks of other drum machines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Design choices like circuitry and synthesis method will inherit character to the sound: timbre, tone, envelope, every single sound dynamic you can think of will be affected, and there's where you'll find the differences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;808 kick sound&quot; means more than just &quot;the kick produced by an 808&quot;, it now usually refers to any kick built using a fast frequency swipe. So, in that sense, you could say that the main difference is there. Is your kick a fast frequency swipe? No? Not an 808, sorry. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isn't there something newer and better?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Newer? Sure, all the time.

Being digital it can go as far as &quot;all ones&quot;, it doesn't matter if it's 16-bit, 24 or 32 - the loudest any individual sample can go is &quot;all ones&quot; … 1111111111111111...&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To a human, it's just some numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Digital audio works down to sample level, each tiny part of the audio picture is built from an absolute number, representing a volume, or how much displacement your speaker should undergo at that precise millisecond.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The 'sound' itself comes from each of those 'speaker positions' one after the other, so fast that we can hear the overall waveforms the speakers make in the air as the cones move in &amp;amp; out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So… if you can only make everything with an &lt;strong&gt;absolute&lt;/strong&gt; maximum volume… how do you make it sound louder?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You use &lt;strong&gt;compression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Compression makes the quieter bits sounds louder - yet it leaves the loudest sounds where they are.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Magical, yes? …&lt;br&gt;&#xA;err… No. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you do this you start to remove the 'punch' of those louder sounds. You can hear &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; sounds at louder volumes, but you still have your absolute volume limit which cannot be exceeded.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;So what starts to happen is that the 'dynamic range' - the difference between the quietest &amp;amp; loudest sounds - becomes smaller. For a while this just makes everything sound more 'together' - coherence of the overall instrument mix - a technique that has been used for 50 years or more, to very good effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This works up to a point - &amp;amp; yes, it does make it start to sound 'louder'… but…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...after that you just squash &amp;amp; squash until it's all just the same volume. You can barely discern the drums are even there, because there's no longer any 'room' left for them to punch through.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Take it to extremes &amp;amp; all there is is 'frequency' with no dynamic… no more loud &amp;amp; soft, only loud…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOO5S4vxi0o&quot;&gt;Everything on &lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We now reach the digital age, everybody wants their song to be the most noticeable on the radio.

House music is associated with Chicago in the early 1980s, and Techno with Detroit. The most distinctive Chicago house sounds were &quot;soulful&quot; house, which used gospel diva samples, piano riffs, and inspirational raps over 4/4 beats, usually realized on an 808 drum machine; and &quot;acid&quot; house, which was a more stripped down &quot;jacking&quot; style of house that featured the TB-303 bassline, used as a melody instrument, to create a squelching, electronic style of dance music. Detroit techno is associated with a specific set of suburban black DJs who were looking to fuse dance music with the avant-garde, sci-fi aesthetic of Kraftwerk and electro. They featured complex, mechanical sounding beats programmed on more advanced drum machines (TR-909) and sequencers (Roland MC500), along with cold, dissonant synthesizers and vocoded voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two ways of making music -- soulful, &quot;deep&quot; dance music, with pronounced aspects of blackness and femininity; and hard, &quot;banging&quot; electronic dance music, using synths and computers -- have given rise to endless variations. To oversimplify vastly, it seems like &quot;house&quot; is the root style of dance music, with an almost classical feel to it. It tends to stay closer to the 118-120BPM of disco and early 1980s club music, and has always been more hospitable to &quot;acoustic&quot; sounding samples, expressive divas, etc. Techno, on the other hand, has tended to speed up, quickly reaching 130-140BPM, and becoming more and more psychedelic, until it spawned (in the 1990s) the very influential style called &quot;trance.&quot; Go to a big dance party and and you will probably hear a descendant of one of these two styles.

This quote from the section linked to sums it up well:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Because of its complex history and tendency to borrow from other musical and cultural forms, it has been argued that &quot;it is impossible to bind rock music to a rigidly delineated musical definition.&quot; -- P. Wicke, Rock Music: Culture, Aesthetics and Sociology (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), ISBN 0-521-39914-9, p. x.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Can this be objectively analyzed? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a lot of cases, sure. AC/DC? Guitar? Check. Drum kit? Check. 4/4 time? Check. Silly lyrics about drinking and getting laid? Check. Yep, that's rock. But in a lot of cases, not at all. The Postal Service?

The size of the print run is determined by how many copies the record company thinks will sell, but keeping in mind two factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are overhead costs for each print run so that, the more copies printed, the lower the manufacturing cost of each copy will be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsold copies must be warehoused, which is also an overhead expense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For most recordings, there is a high initial demand and then a gradual fall-off.

It's common for the sequencers to control the rhythm and pitch, and the knobs and faders to control volume and timbre, but you can make the sequencers and knobs/faders control something else inside the limits of the device.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atGFe2x7E9Y&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; we can see that Skrillex is using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableton_Live&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ableton Live&lt;/a&gt; as a sequencer, but it is more accurately defined as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_editing_system&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;non-linear DAW&lt;/a&gt; (you can think of it as a very powerful hybrid of sampler, synth, mixer, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;drum machine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He is also using a M-Audio Trigger Finger as a control surface, which includes faders, knobs, and pads to control whatever you program them to control in Ableton Live. Maybe he bought this bundle:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/2dhsd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Live-Trigger bundle&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This type of setup (Ableton Live + a control surface) is the most common setup for electronic music live performance now days. When using analog synths, a common setup is to use Live as a sequencer (using MIDI tracks) that feed analog synths (you can see James Holden doing it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKGU68Cg-Xs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, Surgeon doing it &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Ww9VtKqprUY?t=28m17s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, both using modular synths).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, that's what he is doing (ideally, more on that later). Using a control surface to control Ableton Live (if he is doing anything at all, electronic music has its own &quot;lip-sync&quot; issues). Inside Ableton Live you'll find synths, samplers, audio tracks, effects, and whatever audio processing and production dynamic you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What synths, effects, etc is he using? The video suggests that Skrillex is using one knob to control a stutter effect (Live's beat repeat effect, most likely), but it's hard to know for sure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of some interviews (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://equipboard.com/pros/skrillex&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this page, specifically&lt;/a&gt;) we know that he uses stuff like Massive (very common in Dubstep production), Sylenth1, and Reaktor. Through the Finger Trigger he probably controls things like envelopes, LFOs, delay times, distortion amount, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that said, without having the actual Ableton Live patch it is hard to be specific about what he is doing. The control surface might not even be connected and everything is already automated and/or pre-recorded.

They used a bigger glob when pressing the audiophile copy than the old HMV bargain bucket compilations.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Yes, it is more inherently stable, though if warped it will warp badly - but that may be down to transportation &amp;amp; storage and out of the hands of the pressing plant.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;...but the weight itself is simply the end of a long line of areas where your expensive audiophile pressing received greater attention.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So…&lt;br&gt;&#xA;your expensive audiophile vinyl - you would hope - is prepared for you with high attention to detail in all the above factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel that is what makes the &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; difference, not just an extra 50g of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last point…&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Is heavier vinyl 'more durable' than lightweight.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Of course not!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It's exactly the same groove you have your stylus in, however much extra plastic is between you &amp;amp; the B-Side.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that takes us back to how much ex-jukebox dust &amp;amp; other extraneous floor-sweepings are in your nice shiny black stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Virgin vinyl lasts longer because the contaminants are lower. Dust doesn't wear at the same rate as vinyl, so it generates pops &amp;amp; clicks where each softer [or even harder] contaminant is passed over by the needle &amp;amp; changes the erosion rate of that portion of the groove..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Late Edit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I sometimes download dodgy flacs of albums I may buy&lt;br&gt;&#xA;[shoot me, I'm not rich - if I don't like it I bin it, if I do like it I buy it]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have just been listening to the audiophile vinyl (as FLAC 96k) of the last Bowie album, The Next Day… until I got so irritated by the sound quality I just went &amp;amp; bought it on AAC directly from iTunes - the difference is stunning...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;…mainly because whoever uploaded the dodgy version had possibly the dullest record player I've heard in years. Missing high-mids &amp;amp; top, wooly low-mids, over-emphasised bass. The AAC is a whole polished glass window clearer than the dull, listless vinyl I'd been listening to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, word of warning - vinyl is not inherently better, if you don't have a player to match your expectations. Good turntables are really not cheap. They demand a whole lot better throughput than a couple of Burr-Browns &amp;amp; need more care &amp;amp; attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, the downside to my knee-jerk reaction to buy an album I was testing to see if I liked it means I now bought an album I don't really like, just to see what it really sounded like :-(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84" LastEditorUserId="84" LastEditDate="2015-05-02T18:24:40.993" LastActivityDate="2015-05-02T18:24:40.993" CommentCount="2" />

And though there have been shifts in the balance of genre popularity and some new fusions (the increasing crossover of techno/dance and mainstream hip-hop for one), It seems to me that there's been nothing distinctively new since the 90s.

They were more controversial in their personality than was their childhood &quot;difficult&quot;, however.  But I guess the childhood must have had a role in their future career, wouldn't it? Satie was dismissed as a music student and in fact he was not technically superior to his peers.  The fact that most of his music is simplistic (technically) reflects the desire for him to play his own compositions (to later contribute to the rise of ambient music and Dadaism). Schoenberg and other Jewish composers were brought up in the anti-Semitic atmosphere that permeated in the day. The composer also had a fear of the number 13, which affected his subsequent compositions. Growing up at the edge of tonality and the post-Wagnerian world, Schoenberg pushed tonality to the limits, so much so that he went over the border and, as everyone knows, became involved in the development of atonality - dodecaphonic music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are only generalized remarks, I suggest that you read up more on them and discover more about how their early upbringing and start influenced their later development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="428" LastActivityDate="2015-04-28T20:42:09.170" CommentCount="0" />

Sometimes quickly, sometimes not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also keep inventing new genres, as well as a seemingly infinite range of minute sub-genres, so the pool of options keeps increasing as well as to what will be the next 'pop'ular one. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's no real argument as to why we'd not stop creating new musical genres. Humans have been doing it since they've invented music. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, perhaps the broad, universal trends aren't as noticeable. Up until the early 2000s, most pop music was heavily influenced by the media industries. The labels, radio stations, and MTV has a pretty strong monopoly on dictating what is popular and what is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of the 2000s, the industry went through immense changes and music is now spread in so many more ways that it's become much less centralized. As such, the large decade-spanning monolithic genres have given away to a much more fragmented popular music landscape. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There still a lot going on, we just see it a lot differently than we did in, say, the 80s. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On second read, perhaps I misread the question a bit. I think if we're saying 'major genre' being defined by a huge marketshare, then perhaps the answer is 'no'...we may not have any more major genres of pop music like we did in the period from the 50s-2000s. The reason for this (I theorize) is that the concept of 'major popular music genres' depends on a highly centralized media industry to promote them. When what you listed to was primarily dictated by the record and radio industry (and later, MTV), they had the ability to take a few genres and market them like crazy and essentially 'force' the status of 'major genre' on the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that era is over so perhaps we won't see such 'major' genre shifts as we did before (not that the industry isn't trying...their stake in the online streaming industry is a sign of that...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="309" LastEditorUserId="309" LastEditDate="2015-04-29T06:39:54.510" LastActivityDate="2015-04-29T06:39:54.510" CommentCount="2" />

But the Chaconne is an impressive compositional achievement. Consider the challenge:  you want to write a chaconne - that is, a dance piece built over a repeating bass line - but you are writing for a single instrument, not an ensemble with bass and treble instruments. That instrument normally plays just a single note at a time; two notes at once is possible, but you have to be quite careful which two; three or four require extremely careful planning, and are exponentially harder to write and play, just as juggling plates gets exponentially harder as you add each plate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, you are not satisfied to write a &quot;simple&quot; dance piece. It will be a chaconne, and use chaconne rhythms, but will be a thoroughly contrapuntal piece. Thus in between the carefully chosen double stops, you'll use compound melodies (single melodies that imply multiple independent voices) to set up contrapuntal tension. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that's not hard enough. You will write dozens of variations, shifting figuration, patterns, contrapuntal devices, key and tempo for each one, and then grouping the variations into satisfying emotional arcs that rise and fall. The final result will be danceable, singable, and playable at the same time. It will satisfy violinists (because it is really hard and shows off their skill) and listeners (because it sounds like &quot;real music,&quot; not a violin etude).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm impressed...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="174" LastActivityDate="2015-04-29T07:31:32.653" CommentCount="0" />

A rock musician is more like a painter than a jazz musician:  his &quot;work&quot; is the recording, which is a pseudo-object that can be copied, distributed, etc. Given a distinction at this level, any sound can, in principle, be on a rock record.

Now I'm speaking on classical music terms, but this decomposition of the traditional 12-notes-in-an-octave system into, say, 13-equivalent-intervals-in-an-octave system, can have an impact on today's modern electronic (and I mean electronic in the sense of Stockhausen and the likes) music. I was reminded that maybe it was Edgard Varèse who was involved with this, having been able to produce music with intervals smaller than the traditional half step.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="428" LastActivityDate="2015-04-29T11:51:20.253" CommentCount="1" />

  <row Id="692" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="688" CreationDate="2015-04-29T15:56:34.290" Score="8" Body="&lt;p&gt;The literal meaning of &lt;em&gt;uptown&lt;/em&gt; is usually the more northward part of the center city, but it has connotations (via New York City) of an urban area that is more &quot;upscale&quot;, wealthy, classy and sophisticated. &lt;em&gt;Funk&lt;/em&gt; is a style of music pioneered by black American artists such as James Brown and George Clinton, it was most popular in the 1970's and features a strong percussive effect from a variety of instruments, together creating a strong driving beat.  Typically funk is a messy, dissonant sound played at loud volumes with a strong visceral impact.  It is often used as a dance music.  The word itself is potentially related to the other meaning of &lt;em&gt;funk&lt;/em&gt; as a strong, somewhat unpleasant organic odor (typically body odor).  As a united phrase, &lt;em&gt;Uptown Funk&lt;/em&gt; promises a sophisticated, urbane variation on a raw and powerful musical genre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The specific lyric &quot;funk you up&quot; is a stock phrase in the genre, probably originating with Clinton's influential band &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament-Funkadelic&quot;&gt;Parliament Funkadelic&lt;/a&gt;, which used variations on it in several of their songs (including one that includes the phrase &quot;funked up&quot; in the title).  It's a play on the phrase &quot;f* you up,&quot; primarily meaning to beat someone up, and has the connotation that the music is going to physically attack you, with secondary connotations of sexual satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The song as a whole is a tribute to a 1970's era image of macho sophistication.

  <row Id="693" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="155" CreationDate="2015-04-29T17:17:02.363" Score="3" Body="&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What was classical music called back in the days? (Pre 1900s?) Was it divided in to genres as we do today, or was it simply categorized by the type of instruments used, or just &quot;concert music&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can look back at history in general, in so far as no man living during the Middle Ages would say he was living in &quot;the Middle Ages&quot; in a conversation. I am confident the secular citizens of the time were aware they were in the middle of something - Rome had just collapsed, and a couple of false starts occurred, such as the Carolingian time, but they did not mature. In short, categories and labels are only inventions of today applying to the past. And label can be false - &quot;classical&quot; strictly refers to ancient Greece and Rome, while the music of the Enlightenment had nothing to do with antiquity values. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same is true for music - any music is &lt;em&gt;contemporary&lt;/em&gt; during its time, much like pop music is contemporary to us today. There was no notion of &quot;classical music&quot; back then, because the majority of the music there was fell into one category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there were genres, such as concerto and sonata. Each genre follows/followed a particular form, e.g. sonata-allegro, or rondo. Composers of the time were aware that music would fall into one of these categories/labels depending on the piece's structural buildup and instrumentation, among others. However, what constitutes a genre varied over time. The criteria for a piece to be a nocturne in pre-John Field decades differed from those during Field's own times, to be later &quot;challenged&quot; by Chopin, so on and so forth. The late Romantics, e.g. Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler, favored colossal orchestration and by that reinvented much of what Beethoven had known of a symphony. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Towards the 20th century, however, you start seeing composers more or less aware of stylistic development preceding theirs. For example, Prokofiev wrote the Classical (capital C) symphony (and he was aware of the label, but strictly speaking its style is neo-classical), while Stravinsky was writing in a neo-Bachian manner. While those compositions were largely experimental in nature, there were others that were more utilitarian.  Some composers utilized musical categorization in an attempt to legitimize, say, their own countries. Keep in mind this was during the time of Nationalism. Italy needed a sense of Italian, so Respighi provided a surge by going back to mythic Italian past in pieces such as &quot;The Pines of Rome.&quot;  These composers, along with their compositions, signal a greater divide between a past and a present. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="428" LastEditorUserId="428" LastEditDate="2015-04-29T17:23:52.597" LastActivityDate="2015-04-29T17:23:52.597" CommentCount="0" />

Well, turns out this synth thing is a whole new way of proving you can't play very well - but no-one is going to realise it for a long time - by which time we may have learned to play those too. Let's give it a go…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, late 70's, early 80's there were these things that made not very convincing boink-squeak noises - but, hell, they gave us something to think about.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;They also wanted more of our money to be able to join in. One synth wasn't going to get you far, you also needed a multi-track tape machine to work on; let you bounce tracks together &amp;amp; come up with some fuzzy yet inspiring new songs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we wrote songs based on 'what new toy we bought this month' - not the 'best' way to write, but a way to push the boundaries of a bedroom studio.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next we got a 16-track, some outboard effects &amp;amp; if we were lucky, even a real spring reverb.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the bionks &amp;amp; squeaks started to pall, then there were samplers.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;We could now not just try to emulate &quot;real strings&quot; we could have a Tutti we could play in different keys - &amp;amp; boy, did we use that a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing we did learn was how to 'play the studio'.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;How to.. use a Sequencer; sync it to timecode; bounce tracks on tape; edit tape, ¼&quot; &amp;amp; multitrack; fly in a chorus vocal down an entire track; make a dub/dance/party/disco/mix 12&quot; single with only a razor-blade; run a synth through a Rockman; make a DX7 sound like a banjo [&amp;amp; how a banjo-player would use his instrument to do the same, if only we could afford one]; replace the drum machine snare with one we nicked from &quot;Let's Dance&quot;…&lt;br&gt;&#xA;…we were in hog-heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the 90's, sampling was starting to become more 'clever', more like 'the original'.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Then we got the first DAWs, though we still called them 'sequencers' - but they could do audio too &amp;amp; we could finally lose the old tape machines… though we'd like to still master to DAT… at 48K, if we were lucky… not realising that sample-conversions back to 44.1 were not doing us any favours in the 90's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By 2000, we had widespread internet, MP3s &amp;amp; DAWs that had lots of plugins; some free, some 'stolen'… until we could afford to buy them…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;..but we had access to more noises than ever in the history of man.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what did we do with them, this plethora of new sounds &amp;amp; techniques available to us?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We used the presets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it didn't satisfy in 6 clicks, on to the next plugin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to sound like everyone else - &amp;amp; now it was very possible.

This allows accurate speed control (by a PWM drive system). The turntable platter is the only moving part, and because it acts as part of the drive motor is generally heavier and more stable that that used on other turntables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the belt driven system, the motor is usually a simple DC motor. The belt is between the motor and the turntable.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Speed accuracy and control can only be as good as the motor used. This can vary a lot.&#xA;The belt is subject to many problems, such as stretching, slipping, and moving out of position. So speed variation and vibration can be transferred to the turntable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So from a quality standpoint, the direct drive system is better. But due to the additional electronic components and design costs, these are more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the advantage of the belt drive system is its lower cost. The disadvantage is that the turntable stability and therefore the audio quality are worse compared to the direct drive system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there can be varying quality and cost within each type, both related to these components and others on the turntable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any turntable purporting to be high-quality system should have a strobe along the outer rim of the platter.

The rotating spindle extends outside the enclosing magnets &amp;amp; is then available to do the 'work' of turning an attached device - in a turntable, this would be a rubber pulley belt connected to the platter.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Stopping this with your hand would lead to the belt slipping, detaching or breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/FPus9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a direct drive motor, this relationship is reversed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The coil is held stationary, fixed to the body of the player.

I imagine that I or one of my friends got this nugget of information from one of the hi-fi magazines that were very snooty about such things as they probably still are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look at most 7-inch singles from that time you can see that the vinyl has quite a dull, grey appearance when compared to the very shiny vinyl of 12-inch singles and albums. 7-inch singles were always known to be much lower sound quality than the others - although there are other differences that no-doubt contribute, like the groove density. I think the industry had the general opinion that 7-inch-singles were &quot;disposable&quot; and would not be listened to on serious equipment anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I actually visited a vinyl record production facility at that time and saw that the process involves squeezing a blob of vinyl between the 2 masters until it exudes out to a random shape larger than the required size. An automated blade then sweeps-in and trims the excess to produce the final disk. This is only an assumption, but I took it to be that the excess was kept aside for use in the 7-inch singles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As @Wheat Williams has stated, record companies also used to get many records returned; either because they were faulty or because the shop returned them under the &quot;5% returns&quot; scheme. That was a form of sale-or-return agreement trying to encourage shops to order records in the HOPE of selling them rather than the expectation. Again, all these records would have been recycled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know WHY recycled vinyl produces lower sound quality but I imagine that repeated heating to melting point and then cooling may well have a detrimental effect. 7-inch singles do always appear to be more &quot;brittle&quot; than fresh vinyl when you handle them. It's plausible that maybe the vinyl oxidises in some way as it cools, creating a chemically different material than the fresh vinyl. It is interesting that the aforementioned 35-year-old 12-inch singles and albums in my attic are STILL black, shiny and flexible in a way that their 7-inch counterparts never were.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="297" LastActivityDate="2015-05-18T22:15:58.697" CommentCount="0" />

I have a theory as to why this is but I must stress that I have no evidence to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, I want to dispute the idea that “better” is subjective, the audiophile community like to pretend that’s the case but really, you CAN measure these things objectively if you want to. That’s how hi-fi manufacturers work every day. But that’s an aside…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Vinyl” is actually shorthand for Polyvinyl Chloride – PVC – the same material that has a thousand and one uses in everyday objects. You’ll notice that the proper name for most “plastics” has a “poly” in it somewhere, e.g.:  PVA-Polyvinyl Acetate, Polyethylene. That’s because these materials are &lt;em&gt;Polymers&lt;/em&gt;, long chains of small molecules that are bonded together with strong atomic bonds (chemists are probably laughing at my terminology now, but I think I’m along the right lines).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, you may have noticed that plastics can actually lose their strength over time – often as a result of sunlight. The light can break some of these bonds apart, deteriorating the polymer into its component parts and removing the strength with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, PVC (vinyl) is used in records because the material needs to be strong. The point pressure of a stylus on a groove is incredibly high, it may only be tracking with a matter of grams, but the force is pressing onto an area of about 1/10th (probably somewhat smaller) of a square millimetre. This is why records can wear out; the friction literally scrapes the vinyl away from the walls of the groove. With every little bit removed, the musical information stored on the vinyl decreases. We hear this as noise and distortion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where I start speculating. As I stated in my answer to the other question, I believe the vinyl is degraded in some way when it is recycled. My theory is that when it is heated to melting point, that heat will cause &lt;em&gt;some proportion&lt;/em&gt; of the bonds in the vinyl to break. This leads to shorter polymer chains and a weaker material. As the stylus passes over the groove it will scrape away more of the groove wall with each pass, rendering the sound quality lower and lower with each play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I’m right, this happens to some extent even with “virgin” vinyl – but if the vinyl is recycled then another batch of the molecules will be affected – and, even worse, the previously affected molecules may be shortened even further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="297" LastActivityDate="2015-05-22T16:53:13.353" CommentCount="2" />

The songs are supposed to be performed all at once, in order, and either tell a single story (a setting of a long narrative poem or a number of poems by one poet), or which use different poems by different poets to explore a certain mood or emotion. Typically a song cycle is written for one singer and one piano, but there are song cycles for one singer and orchestra as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One famous example is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterreise&quot;&gt;Winterreise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&quot;a journey in Winter&quot;) by the composer Franz Schubert, set to poems by Wilhelm Müller, in the German language. It was published in 1827. It is written for a male singer and piano. It consists of 24 songs and it takes more than one hour to sing the entire piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Schubert also set a poetic story of Wilhelm Müller's called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_sch%C3%B6ne_M%C3%BCllerin&quot;&gt;Die schöne Müllerin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&quot;The beautiful miller's daughter&quot;), which also takes one hour to sing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The song cycle has been a popular form in German-, English- and French-language music, since the mid-1800s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples of well-known English-language song cycles are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Travel&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Songs of Travel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 1904 by Ralph Vaughan Williams to poems by Robert Louis Stephenson, 24 minutes in length.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit_Songs&quot;&gt;Hermit Songs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from 1953 by Samuel Barber to poems by several poets, 18 minutes in length&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You added &quot;Some would say the opera, but that's not English.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Excuse me, but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:English-language_operas&quot;&gt;there are thousands of operas written in English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, starting about 400 years ago, just as there are thousands of operas written in French, Italian, German, Russian, and practically every other language.

It is most certainly not uniquely associated with Bruce Springsteen, Chuck Berry, or any other musician.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the concept and the image of The Promised Land resonate with Springsteen because of his Roman Catholic faith. The concept of &quot;The Promised Land&quot; comes up again and again in the theology and teaching not only of the Catholic Church but also in all forms of Judaism and Christianity, throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Promised Land&quot; is a literary and artistic symbol for any ethnic group achieving freedom from oppression, especially slavery, and of achieving peace after struggle and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Promised Land&quot; can also refer to the Christian concept of Heaven (or of a person experiencing death and going to Heaven), as a land of rest after the suffering and struggle of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The origin of the term &quot;The Promised Land&quot; comes from the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament) and is thousands of years old. &quot;The Promised Land&quot; refers, geographically, to the land of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Canaan&lt;/a&gt;, a region corresponding to modern-day Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, western Jordan, and southwestern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within American music in the last two hundred years,&lt;/strong&gt; references to &quot;The Promised Land&quot;, &quot;Canaan's Land&quot;, and &quot;crossing over the River Jordan&quot; can be found frequently in African-American spirituals, black gospel, and in reggae music. But it has always been found, world-wide, throughout the entire history of any kind of Christian or Jewish sacred music or any music inspired by those traditions, in every language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;African-Americans who were slaves in the USA in the 18th and 19th centuries, and who became Christians, saw the Bible stories about the Hebrew slaves gaining their freedom and inheriting and possessing the Promised Land of Canaan to be a metaphor for their own struggle to achieve emancipation from slavery and live as free citizens in the USA. That is why there are so many references to The Promised Land throughout African-American spirituals. African-American spirituals are the direct ancestors of the blues, jazz, gospel, and rock and roll music. And Bruce Springsteen's music, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Promised Land is a frequently-referenced concept of the USA's African-American Civil Rights movement. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/4WZbxYGy3As?t=1m50s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; makes frequent references to The Promised Land in his sermons and speeches. Watch this short clip from Dr. King's final speech:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/4WZbxYGy3As?t=1m50s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://youtu.be/4WZbxYGy3As?t=1m50s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can find references to &quot;The Promised Land&quot; in reggae music, including that of Bob Marley. For the Jamaicans and adherents of the Rastafarian religion, The Promised Land refers to their own struggle for equality and freedom for their ethnic group, but also had specific references to nations in Africa gaining independence from European colonial influences in the 20th-century. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The literal meaning and original concept of The Promised Land&lt;/strong&gt;, as the land of Canaan, originates in the Jewish Bible, the Old Testament, in the Book of Genesis. The concept is referenced time and time again in the subsequent books of the Bible, throughout the Jewish and Christian Bibles (the Old and New Testaments).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promised_Land&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on The Promised Land&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Book of Genesis, God establishes an eternal contract with the family of a man named Abraham; he is the progenitor of the Hebrews, later knows as the Israelites and later as the Jews. God tells the Hebrew people that they are the Chosen People of God. He promises them that they will inherit the Promised Land (Canaan) and be able to live there as a nation. Once the entire race of the Hebrews have been freed from slavery in Egypt, the prophet Moses leads the Hebrews to the edge of the Promised Land, and the military leader Joshua takes the Hebrews across the River Jordan and into the Promised Land and conquers its peoples. This leads eventually to the establishment of the city of Jerusalem, and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throughout the subsequent history of the world,&lt;/strong&gt; many writers, poets, artists and musicians have made frequent references to &quot;The Promised Land&quot;. Not only was this a literal reference to the Bible stories; it also became a literary and artistic symbol for any contemporary ethnic group achieving freedom from oppression, and peace after struggle and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, &quot;The Promised Land&quot; has nothing to do with Bruce Springsteen, per se. It has to do with Bruce Springsteen's Christian faith, and with thousands of years of world culture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2015-06-02T03:32:37.667" LastActivityDate="2015-06-02T03:32:37.667" CommentCount="5" />

The Guitorgan was polyphonic, meaning you could play 6-note chords on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were a number of guitar effects devices marketed as &quot;guitar synthesizers&quot; in the 1970s, and they were used by professional guitarists on recordings, but these devices were not true synthesizers: they were merely extreme stomp-box-type effects which performed signal processing on the audio output of a conventional electric guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Page used the first &quot;proper&quot; mass-produced guitar synthesizer, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vintagesynth.com/arp/avatar.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ARP Avatar&lt;/a&gt;, on the song &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot; on the Led Zeppelin album &lt;em&gt;In Through the Out Door&lt;/em&gt;, 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pete Townsend of The Who also had an ARP Avatar around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from a 6-note polyphonic fuzz-box mode, the Avatar was a monophonic synthesizer, meaning you could only play one note at a time, and not chords. This was extremely limiting for a guitarist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story goes that the research and development cost to create the ARP Avatar was so high, and the sales were so poor (because the instrument did not really work well and was not practical), that it caused the ARP company to go out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most practical and common guitar synths were made by the Roland company. Their instruments were polyphonic. Roland produced a very long line of different models, I believe starting with the GR-500 model in 1980. It was featured on David Bowie's &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; in 1980, played by Chuck Hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Andy Summers made use of a Roland guitar synth on the song &quot;Don't Stand So Close to Me&quot; on the Police album &lt;em&gt;Zenyatta Mondatta&lt;/em&gt; in the same year, 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1981, Adrian Belew and Robert Fripp made extensive use of Roland's newest guitar synthesizer, the GR-303, on every song on the landmark King Crimson album &lt;em&gt;Discipline&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pat Metheney also played the Roland GR-303, but he interfaced it to the New England Digital Synclavier, a digital audio workstation instrument that cost several hundreds of thousands of dollars in its day. His first use of the guitar synth was on his album &lt;em&gt;Offramp&lt;/em&gt; in 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So Metheny's use of the guitar synthesizer was preceded by David Bowie, the Police, King Crimson, and undoubtedly others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2015-06-02T04:02:56.293" LastActivityDate="2015-06-02T04:02:56.293" CommentCount="0" />

The typical ensemble is formed of two horns and a rhythm section (quintet), but other common sizes ranged from trio to septet. The classic bebop combo consisted of saxophone, trumpet, double bass, drums and piano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bebop musicians employed several harmonic devices not typical of previous jazz. Complicated harmonic substitutions for more basic chords became commonplace. These substitutions often emphasized certain dissonant intervals such as the flat ninth, sharp ninth or the sharp eleventh/tritone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drastically changed role for the instruments: Bop drummers shifted primary timekeeping duties from bass drum to cymbals and snare, lending the music a lighter, effervescent aura. They began playing multiple overlapping rhythms (polyrhythms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus is in the solos, in contrast with swing where the focus is on the arrangement and the playing of the ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is more musically complex than big band swing: more complex chords, harmony, and solos, along with faster tempos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The priority is listening, rather than dancing.

This brings a gravity to the to the second note. Add to that a leading eighth note, and that third note draws the listener to it.

The correlation you see to rock band's first albums is probably some kind of selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trains were a major part of American life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Unlike today, when most passenger train use is in cities, passenger trains would be regularly used in both urban and rural settings. Because of how common, yet impressive, they were, they found their way into many songs, just as the car would later leave its mark on popular music, starting in the 1950's.  A train can be used in song to represent travel, escape, break-up, returning, industry, working men: a whole host of great song concepts.  Some people have even speculated about chugging blues rhythms being inspired by the sound of trains going past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Passenger train use declined as cars became the more common means of transportation, but the legacy of train songs did not go away quickly. &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0252068815&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Long Steel Rail&lt;/a&gt; by Norm Cohen documents the earlier period of folk and gospel train songs, but there are also many &quot;second generation&quot; (more like fifth generation) train songs found in rock music (&lt;em&gt;Crazy Train, Train Kept a Rollin, Midnight Train to Georgia, City of New Orleans, Tuesday's Gone&lt;/em&gt;, on and on and on).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have time to do a serious study, but if you wanted, you could try to chart songs that mention trains and list what album number they appeared on for a given musician or group.  This might be skewed somewhat because some groups only have one album, or the first album is the strongest. Also, some group's first albums were comprised mostly of cover songs (e.g. The Rolling Stones), so that might bump up the likelihood of a train song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastActivityDate="2015-06-15T23:46:04.287" CommentCount="3" />

The Beatles tracks, like all other music sold on iTunes, is DRM-free. You can use the iTunes app for Mac or Windows to convert iTunes files into MP3 format, or to transcode the files into several other formats including burning them to CD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a very long, strange story behind this: the Beatles, and specifically George Harrison (1943-2001), from 1978 onward, spent &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt; trying to sue Apple, Inc. out of business, because the Beatles' corporation, which they formed in 1968, was called &lt;strong&gt;Apple Corps&lt;/strong&gt;, and the Beatles' record label, affiliated with Apple Corps, was called &lt;strong&gt;Apple Records&lt;/strong&gt;. Apple Computer, which of course had nothing to do with Apple Records, was founded in the USA in 1976. George Harrison was incensed that there was a brand of computer hardware called &quot;Apple&quot; that could be used by musicians to record and edit music, or that could be used by consumers to play back music. Harrison, to his death, insisted that any use of the term &quot;Apple&quot; involving any kind of physical product that could make or play music, anywhere in the world, was an infringement on the trademarks of the Apple Records company which he co-founded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Beatles' Apple Records had lawsuits against Apple Computer tied up in British courts for decades, claiming that Apple Computer (later called Apple, Inc.) should abandon their name and trademarks. It proved impossible for Apple to completely settle all the lawsuits while George Harrison was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Apple Computer opened the Apple iTunes Store in 2003 to sell digital downloads of music (even though none of the Beatles' music was sold there), the Beatles redoubled their legal efforts to sue Apple, saying that an online music store run by another company called &quot;Apple&quot; was unacceptable to them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact it took another six years after Harrison's death before Apple could settle with Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and the other rights-holders associated with the British Apple Records corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2007 Apple, Inc. settled the Beatles' lawsuits by paying the Beatles' corporation a sum reported to be around US $500 million (earlier settlements for earlier disputes had already cost Apple, Inc. hundreds of millions of dollars as well.) The settlement included an arrangement for a licensing agreement of the necessary trademarks. Three years later, in 2010, the Beatles' catalog of recordings were made available for sale on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this massive settlement between the two parties, so far digital downloads of the Beatles' catalog are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; sold through the iTunes store, and nowhere else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps_v_Apple_Computer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on Apple Corps v Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2015-06-16T08:20:17.597" LastActivityDate="2015-06-16T08:20:17.597" CommentCount="0" />

  <row Id="941" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="920" CreationDate="2015-06-17T14:17:02.897" Score="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;To summarize and expound upon what has been said in earlier answers: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has to do with race, ethnicity and music history. Rock is a derivative form of music mostly created by white people in England and the USA from the late 1950s forward. The clearly-acknowledged source material for white rock musicians in the 1950s and 1960s was the music of black Americans from previous decades: blues, rhythm &amp;amp; blues, gospel and rural and urban folk music of black people, from the late 1800s up through the beginning of rock and roll itself in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early rock songs borrowed themes from African-American music from earlier decades, and in many cases early rock songs were simply cover versions of existing black music in more of a rhythm and blues genre. One of these prominent themes was that of trains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides this, however, references to trains are found in other kinds of music of white people in the USA and England going back to, well, the invention of trains in the early 1800s. There are numerous references to trains in old-time Appalacian music and in bluegrass and country music throughout this long time-period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no, the use of trains and travel by train as a theme is not particular to rock music at all. It is found in all the earlier kinds of music that rock and roll music paid tribute to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The clearest example I can think of is that of the song &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_Kept_A-Rollin&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Train Kept A-Rollin'&quot;, released in 1951 by the black musician Tiny Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt;, in the jump-blues style.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This record was a minor hit, but it was only known among black Americans, because the record of that song was only marketed and sold in black communities and in stores that only sold records to black customers. It was only broadcast on radio stations that catered exclusively to black listeners. This was the reality of the segregationist society in the USA in the early 1950s. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in 1956, a group of white musicians named Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio recorded the song in New York and the record was marketed to white record stores and white radio stations, becoming a much larger hit. Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio are considered to be among the very first rock bands. Then, in 1965, the British white rock band The Yardbirds made a hugely successful cover-version of this song. Led Zeppelin performed this song in concert. In 1976, the American white rock band Aerosmith made another cover-version of this song, and this version became a standard among rock bands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So with this example you can see how the theme and the music progressed from a black source that pre-dates rock and roll and carries through to the classic rock era.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2015-06-17T14:26:13.647" LastActivityDate="2015-06-17T14:26:13.647" CommentCount="0" />

So while there is a formal path for studying the subject, simple things like someone listening to a song and figuring out what they like and what they don't is also music theory. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people only equate music theory to an intro class that focuses on the classical era which most modern types of western music are rooted in, but there is so much more. There are pop, jazz, blues, and rock  music theory classes and books that focus much more on modern songs and deconstructing them so people can learn what works and what doesn't. People who study music theory in depth eventually tailor their ideas towards what they find works and what doesn't using what they learned as a foundation for this and utilizes this in what they compose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So while Jimi Hendrix probably couldn't tell you what a modulation was, he did it all the time. While he wouldn't have known about the circle of 5ths, he took advantage of progressions that used it, like &lt;em&gt;Hey Joe&lt;/em&gt;. While he was never taught how to build chords, he did so in the typical fashion even his famous &lt;strong&gt;7#9&lt;/strong&gt; chord that is even called the Hendrix chord.

It is a &quot;catch-all&quot; term used to lump together a very broad number of genres across a number of different cultures across many centuries. There is certainly much more than one style of music involved in such a vast period of time and across a vast range of cultures and peoples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when we refer to a contemporary genre such as &quot;rock music&quot;, we are referring to a particular and very narrowly-defined style of music made mostly by musicians in the United States of America and England from about 1956 up until the present day, and chiefly by ethnically white musicians who speak and write lyrics in English. This is a tiny, brief genre compared to the entire history of all music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many music historians do not like to use the term &quot;classical music&quot;, and there are many other ideas about how this music should be described. My preferred term is &quot;traditional music&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When most people use the term &quot;classical music&quot; they are referring to all the &quot;traditional&quot; music made in all the countries in Western Europe since the dawn of civilization, in every nation and in every language. Furthermore in recent centuries the great powers of Western Europe conquered and colonized the rest of the world, spreading their music culture with them. So there has been classical music written in places like Mexico and the USA and Argentina which are derived from Western European forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Music from the traditions of Eastern Europe, the Arab nations, Asia and India and Africa, and elsewhere have their own distinct melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic languages, musical instruments and styles that are very different than Western music. These styles developed virtually completely independently from Western music, and vice-versa. This is why we don't include indigenous music from these cultures when we talk about &quot;Western classical music&quot;. This is not to imply that music from these non-Western cultures is in any way inferior. These musics have their own kinds of sophistication and virtuosity. But these musics are so different in character that we don't fit them into a discussion of what we call &quot;Western classical&quot;.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within the &quot;Western classical&quot; tradition, we do, however, make a distinction between &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;folk&quot; music. The distinction is chiefly &lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt; along with being artistic. Historically, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;classical&quot; music&lt;/strong&gt; is music that is supported by &lt;em&gt;patronage&lt;/em&gt;. The music is created when wealthy people, churches, governments or corporations hire composers and musicians and pay them to create their music. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Folk&quot; music&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, is music made by musicians who have no expectation of earning any money from their music -- they just play it for the love of music, and they are not part of the &quot;patronage&quot; system. They make &quot;music of the folk&quot; which tends to be less formally-organized, and handed down from generation to generation in more of an oral tradition, not written down in fixed form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the 20th century a third kind of music came about: &quot;commercial&quot; music. &lt;strong&gt;Commercial music&lt;/strong&gt; is music that attempts to earn its own income without patronage, from selling things like recordings and sheet music, or getting paid royalties for having recordings played on radio or television or used in motion pictures. Of course this did not happen until the 20th century because before that time there were no recordings, radio, television or motion pictures, no iPods, no Internet. Of course during the period of &quot;commercial music&quot;, or better put, &quot;the music industry&quot; there continues to be &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;folk&quot; music being created. But when music and musicians enter the &quot;music industry&quot; their music tends to become less &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;folk&quot; and more &quot;commercial&quot; in character. Genres like jazz, rock, Broadway, country, or any kind of electronic dance music fall into the &quot;commercial&quot; category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When historians speak of &quot;classical&quot; music, they usually speak of distinct style periods, according to eras in history. Each style period includes all the &quot;classical&quot; music made in every nation, in every language, in every style of instrumentation or singing. Here is a list of the generally-agreed-upon style periods. Of course all dates and years are approximate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient (before 500 AD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medieval (500 AD to 1400 AD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renaissance (1400 to 1600)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baroque (1600 to 1750)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classical (1750 to 1830)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romantic (1830 to 1910)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern (from the beginning of World War I to the end of World War II)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-Modern (1945 to today)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these names and distinctions of dates were labeled after the periods in question were over. (the terms &quot;Modern&quot; and &quot;Post-Modern&quot; sound lame because, well, not enough time has passed for us to invent more clever names.) And the &quot;barriers&quot; between one style period and another were not rigid. However, dividing things up into &lt;em&gt;style periods&lt;/em&gt; gives one an opportunity to understand how Western classical music has evolved and developed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each different &quot;style period&quot; is characterized by composers using particular kinds of rhythm, melody and harmony in their music. New methods and styles of melodies, rhythms and harmonies were invented and used in each of the successive style periods, and these methods spread in waves throughout the Western world. I cannot take any more time here to explain how the music of each of these style periods is different; I hope that I have provided you a framework to do your own study on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2015-06-24T14:54:51.810" LastActivityDate="2015-06-24T14:54:51.810" CommentCount="0" />

Better converters will reproduce the signal more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the difference in quality between cheap and expensive converters is very small. That difference is hard to perceive even for well trained ears. In blind tests, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soundonsound.com/news?NewsID=13352&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sometimes cheap converters are preferred over very expensive ones&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there is an impact, but it is minimum.

Assuming that the connection between your turntable and mixer is phono, and the mixer doesn't route the analog audio to the converter, then the sound card won't have any impact whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is your mixer making use of its converter in your setup? I don't know. To know for sure how the routing in your mixer works you'll have to google around and/or check the manual, maybe call customer support. But again, unless you have well trained ears and your hearing environment is optimal (acoustically treated and isolated, good quality monitors which are well positioned, etc) I wouldn't worry about it since you won't be able to perceive the difference at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="70" LastEditorUserId="70" LastEditDate="2015-07-03T18:40:16.170" LastActivityDate="2015-07-03T18:40:16.170" CommentCount="0" />

That is, labeling something by genre gives a sense of its innate structure and the &quot;rules&quot; by which it plays -- or, perhaps more interestingly, the rules it plays around with. (This is why (I personally believe) there is significant argument around whether or not artists fit into certain genres. It seems to be particularly endemic to some metal sub-genres, where there's even a term for 'trueness to the genre': &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kvlt&quot;&gt;kvlt&lt;/a&gt;.) More simply -- or more individually -- the label of genre is one of the shortcuts that helps me decide whether or not I may like it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rest of this answer concerns your other questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't found any information on the explicit beginnings of assigning music genres. The classification by genre of art (in general; literature specifically) goes back almost as far as written history, to at least &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.jrank.org/pages/10754/Poetry-Poetics-Genre.html&quot;&gt;Plato and Aristotle&lt;/a&gt;.  It's clear that musical genre defining is not solely a modern (20th century) pursuit; for instance, the term 'Baroque' was first applied to music in the early eighteenth century (&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=aw1TTtpp4FwC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;dq=baroque&amp;amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=true&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) in an attempt to differentiate then-modern music from the preceding century. Especially if the definition &quot;genre&quot; includes stylistic and differences in form, I think it's reasonable to assume that recognizable musical genre classification (baroque vs modern, Italian Opera vs French Opera) has been happening since at least the early 1700s, but probably even earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for whether or not there are objective standards for genre inclusion... the answer is more or less a frustrating &quot;kind of&quot;, in the &quot;know it when I see it&quot; vein. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is often considerable theoretical disagreement&#xA;  about the definition of specific genres. 'A genre is ultimately an&#xA;  abstract conception rather than something that exists empirically in&#xA;  the world,' notes Jane Feuer (1992, 144). One theorist's genre may be&#xA;  another's sub-genre or even super-genre (and indeed what is technique,&#xA;  style, mode, formula or thematic grouping to one may be treated as a&#xA;  genre by another)... Conventional definitions of genres tend to be&#xA;  based on the notion that they constitute particular conventions of&#xA;  content (such as themes or settings) and/or form (including structure&#xA;  and style) which are shared by the texts which are regarded as&#xA;  belonging to them... It is seldom hard to find texts which are&#xA;  exceptions to any given definition of a particular genre. There are no&#xA;  'rigid rules of inclusion and exclusion' Gledhill 1985, 60).&#xA;  'Genres... are not discrete systems, consisting of a fixed number of&#xA;  listable items' (ibid., 64). It is difficult to make clear-cut&#xA;  distinctions between one genre and another: genres overlap, and there&#xA;  are 'mixed genres' (such as comedy-thrillers). Specific genres tend to&#xA;  be easy to recognize intuitively but difficult (if not impossible) to&#xA;  define.

The answer is all about marketing and money, and it is all charted in the history of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, published weekly out of New York since 1894. &lt;strong&gt;The most important year or event in this story is 1936&lt;/strong&gt;; I will explain below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;80 or 90 years ago the environment was different than it is today. Consequently, when the idea of musical genres was first delineated, it meant something different to what it means today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first appearance of music genres goes back to right after World War I, in the USA, when the industry of selling recorded music and marketing it to radio stations began. (At this time, radio stations were exclusively broadcasting live musicians playing in the radio studio, because there were not yet many record companies sending them records to play on the air. Furthermore one radio station would generally broadcast a wide variety of different styles of music that appealed to many different kinds of people, usually rotating the styles of music they played in blocks of several hours at a time on certain days of the week.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Genres were created and clearly delineated by the record companies, the radio stations, and indirectly by the economic pressure from the companies who paid the radio stations to run advertisements for the products they sold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that radio stations made money by selling time for advertisements. The advertisers would be more inclined to pay for time if they knew that the radio station could deliver to them a specific audience of radio listeners who would be likely to buy the product that they sold. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is an over-simplified example: If a company was already in the business of selling an acne-treating product that they were spending money marketing to white teenage girls (through magazines or television or billboards or specific retail drug store chains), then they wanted to find radio stations whose listeners were overwhelmingly white teenage girls. This is where they would choose to spend their radio advertising money. Radio stations quickly became more aware of this, so they began to differentiate and to change their previously wide-ranging musical broadcasts of many musical styles into very specific niches. In this example, a radio station would devote the entire airtime throughout the week to play music provided by record companies which was tailored to appeal only to white teenage girls. This means that the record companies got actively involved in combining record producers with songwriters and bands that would release a steady stream of new music that would appeal primarily to teenage white girls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus the modern music industry was born. Genres were created based upon the demographics required by the companies purchasing the advertising. When record labels released newly-recorded music, they created promotional staffs that would recommend individual recordings to specific radio stations that catered to a specific genre in order to enable all the businesses involved to maximize the sale of both certain kinds of musical records and acne treatment to white teenage girls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)&quot;&gt;Billboard Magazine&lt;/a&gt; had been in operation since 1894, and it is still in operation. It is the USA magazine which from the earliest days of the radio and record industry reported on which records were being aired the most on radio, where, and which records were being sold the most in stores, and where. &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; was and never has been a magazine for fans of music. Rather, it is an industry publication that helps music businesses follow trends and decide where to invest their marketing money to sell records.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting in 1936, &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; magazine began organizing its reporting on the sales and airplay of specific records according to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_charts&quot;&gt;charts organized by musical genre&lt;/a&gt;. This was a confirmation and a continuation of a practice that had been going on for years beforehand. It goes without saying that the music industries in other nations of the world, whereever they had radio stations and record companies, followed the marketing methods being developed in the USA and adapted them to their own particular markets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;, weekly, would publish a &quot;Pop&quot; chart (&quot;popular&quot; music appealing to the most desireable and lucrative demographic for selling products through advertising, in other words young middle-and-upper-class white people in the USA), a &quot;Race&quot; chart (meaning the tracking of records played on radio stations that were specifically aimed at African-American listeners), a &quot;Country&quot; chart, a &quot;Jazz&quot; chart, and others. As the years progressed, the name and number and focus of the charts would shift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was radio DJs and &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; magazine editors and record company executives who actually created and named specific genres,&lt;/strong&gt; using terms like &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Country&quot; (which originally was called &quot;Hillbilly&quot;) and &quot;R&amp;amp;B&quot; (which originally stood for &quot;Rhythm and Blues&quot; and before that was called &quot;Race Records&quot;). These &quot;genres&quot; were certainly not created and defined by musicians themselves. It was a giant feedback loop, which propagated ever-more-specific genres. The large national corporations who purchased the advertising time and marketed their products through the advertising certainly participated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The term used within the USA music business to describe the &quot;genre&quot; of music played on a particular radio station is the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_format&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; (Link to Wikipedia article) Check out this Wikipedia article and you will see that the different kinds of &lt;em&gt;formats&lt;/em&gt; listed correspond more or less with what music fans refer to as &lt;em&gt;genres&lt;/em&gt;, taking into account that &lt;em&gt;formats&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;genres&lt;/em&gt; are always changing in a fluid fashion as time goes by. Over the decades the popular concept of &quot;genre&quot; has really always been about &lt;em&gt;radio formats&lt;/em&gt; and changes in marketing business plans for radio stations, and this has been reflected in the charts published in &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that individual musicians and whole bands who got into the music industry were steered by the record companies and their producers into creating specific kinds of recorded music that fit clearly into specific genres, for the purpose of maximizing the efficiency of marketing and sales. If a given musician or band ever wanted to change their &quot;genre&quot; or even to record different songs from different &quot;genres&quot; on the same record album, the record company tended strongly to prohibit this, because such an album could not be effectively marketed through existing marketing channels. Musical compositions became known as &quot;product&quot; because recordings were sold as physical items in stores, marketed through radio, and not as &quot;art&quot; or &quot;music&quot; anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with the idea of &quot;genres&quot; is that it caught the public's imagination. The public, along with the music critics in the press, seemed to enjoy the idea of &quot;I'm a country music fan&quot; or &quot;I'm an R&amp;amp;B fan&quot; and defining themselves thusly. I remember in the 1970s when country music fans would wear T-shirts that said, &quot;If it ain't country, you can kiss my ass&quot;, meaning that they would only listen to music which the radio stations and record labels, and by extension the advertisers, &lt;em&gt;defined&lt;/em&gt; as &quot;country&quot;. For many decades, people became accustomed to only being willing to listen to music which was marketed within the specific &quot;genre&quot; that the fans had identified as the one they preferred.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now things are very different today. Now that we have the Internet and we can experience and listen to a great variety of music, we no longer depend so heavily upon the ways in which businesses like radio stations, record companies and corporations who market to us define the genres.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the result has been ever-more-increasingly fine &quot;genres&quot; anyway. For example, take the rock music fan who doesn't think in terms of rock music. He doesn't think in terms of liking hard rock. He doesn't think in terms of heavy metal. He prefers to assert that he likes only symphonic death metal, and &quot;death to false metal.&quot; Or somebody will not acknowledge that he likes music made by African-Americans, but rather that he likes a specific sub-genre of hip-hop. Or somebody who doesn't think in terms of liking dance music, but rather identifies with a specific sub-genre of EDM or dubstep or acid house or whatever all those genre terms are these days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea of musical genres was created and carefully crafted by businesspeople to maximize the sale of records, but also products like acne cream to teenage girls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2015-07-11T23:11:43.783" LastActivityDate="2015-07-11T23:11:43.783" CommentCount="0" />

There are two kinds of revenue. On the one hand there are royalties paid to songwriters. On the other hand there are business contracts for the sale of the actual recordings of the songs, paid to the record labels who own the recordings, and who usually financed the recording sessions and financed the manufacture and distribution of the recordings in physical form, e.g. CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every nation has a bureau of the government called a &lt;strong&gt;performing rights organization&lt;/strong&gt; that collects royalties on behalf of songwriters and/or their publishing companies (except in the USA, where there are several private organizations, eg ASCAP, BMI and SESAC, who collect royalties for songwriters and publishing companies under the authority of laws passed by the government).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each nation's performing rights organization has to address the problem of collecting royalties for performances and sales of the songs written by songwriters who are citizens of their nation that take place in other nations. They have to strike reciprocal arrangements with other performing rights organizations in other nations, and they have to reach international accords on rates and business practices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every record label in every nation has to conduct licensing arrangements and make legal contracts to sell their music products domestically and world-wide. If people somewhere are selling their recordings without having reached a licensing agreement, then that is regarded as theft, but it is up to the record labels to pursue legal actions against the pirates. Given the international legal environment, or lack thereof, it would be very hard if not impossible for an American record label, for example, to press a lawsuit for piracy against a company selling MP3s in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's my understanding that the laws and business practices for collecting and paying royalties and making licensing agreements in the Ukraine are exceptionally weak and the rates collected and payed are exceptionally low compared to those of many other nations. This is why those cheap MP3 sites are operating in the jurisdiction of the Ukraine to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they do is tolerated and may meet the requirements of the law &lt;em&gt;within the Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but I daresay that the performing rights organizations and record labels of the other nations in the world are disappointed with the way business is done in Ukraine because if any royalties or licensing fees are payed and collected, very little money ever changes hands, and very little if any money makes its way out of the Ukraine and back to the songwriters and record labels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Follow the old adage of &quot;If it sounds too good to be true, it is not true.&quot; If you are concerned about the music you purchase resulting in money getting back to the artists who created the music, then don't purchase it at ridiculously cheap prices from shady businesses headquartered in a nation with shady laws and business practices regarding the sale of recorded music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastActivityDate="2015-07-13T12:15:54.043" CommentCount="0" />

There are so many books on the history of rock available now that the best suggestion I can give you is to go to a major library, or the music library of a university with a music degree program, and simply browse the stacks of books on the subject of rock and pop music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another tip: Wikipedia articles themselves are often of questionable quality, but each article has to cite published books and print magazines if the article is to be approved by the Wikipedia editors. So find a particular band or genre you are interested in on Wikipedia, and then look at the References at the end of the article and identify books that you could find for further research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there are magazines. I would look for articles published in magazines written for musicians rather than magazines aimed at fans. Articles about rock bands and rock music in fan magazines (even with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com&quot;&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the best of the lot) tend to focus on the lifestyles of the artists and not about the music itself.

When bebop first began to appear in jazz clubs, they literally posted signs asking audience members not to try to dance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Wikipedia article on Bebop&lt;/a&gt; explains it pretty well:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies, complex syncopation,&#xA;  altered chords, chord substitutions, asymmetrical phrasing, intricate&#xA;  melodies and using rhythm sections in a way that expanded on their&#xA;  role.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A classic Bebop piece is characterized by taking the basic chord progression of a well-known Broadway show tune or jazz standard, discarding the melody altogether, making the chord progression dramatically more complicated by complex chord substitution, playing the song at a very fast tempo, and having the soloists compose entirely new melodies in a very complex, chromatic or even atonal manner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to hear saxophone in the bebop style, listen to the recordings of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charlie Parker&lt;/a&gt; after about 1945.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okrNwE6GI70&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okrNwE6GI70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lester Young's contribution to the early, developing style of bebop can be heard in his recordings with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman_Hawkins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coleman Hawkins&lt;/a&gt; as part of the much larger &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_at_the_Philharmonic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jazz at the Philharmonic (JATP)&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, on Verve Records.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of those recordings on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kM4_Yds1rQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kM4_Yds1rQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2015-07-26T01:32:49.107" LastActivityDate="2015-07-26T01:32:49.107" CommentCount="2" />

They pay advances, money to help you record your songs.  They also help with publicity.  There are hundreds of songs published everyday on SoundCloud and other sources that really, you'll get lost, you WON'T be exposed to millions.  They help book big stadiums that you might not be able to do by yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A record label can also help you get on the radio (which won't give a random musician play time).  A record label helps with distribution of CDs (which are still a big money maker).   Basically, they do the behind the scenes things and let you focus on your music, your social media presence, and connecting with your fans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are labels etc. really that greedy or are artists making a fuss?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Labels typically take 100% of revenue until your advance it payed off, then split 85/15 with the artist (that, of course, depends on your contract).

Artists and labels would like to have more people on the paying platform because they get more royalties from paying accounts than from free accounts, (but they'd much rather have people use the free accounts on Spotify than have them pirate the content).  But when Pharrell's &quot;Happy&quot; made $2,700 with 43 million streams on Pandora (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/pharrell-made-only-2700-in-songwriter-royalties-from-43-million-plays-of-happy-on-pandora-2014-12&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;), you can see why they are mad.

This occurs in many types of music, but &quot;headbanging&quot; is when this is taken to a much more intense level. The performer or listener throws his or her whole body into moving to a hard rock song, shaking their head violently forward and backward to the heavy beat, often making their long hair fly back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This move first became named and popular among listeners in the early 1980's in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hardcore punk&lt;/a&gt; scene, about the same time that the similar activity of &quot;moshing&quot; in a &quot;mosh pit&quot; took off, but there are documented cases of listeners headbanging at Led Zeppelin shows as early as 1969, and of the performers Ozzy Osbourne and Geezer Butler doing it by 1970.  It grew more common in the late 1980's and early 1990's at heavy metal and grunge concerts, and the term was further popularized with the 1987 launch of the nighttime MTV show &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headbangers_Ball&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Headbangers Ball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headbanging on the album cover of Nirvana's 1989 debut, &lt;em&gt;Bleach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/8IxUF.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/8IxUF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Headbanging on the album cover of Nirvana&amp;#39;s 1989 debut, *Bleach*&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classic music to headbang to would be 1980's hardcore.

Skiffle, although largely forgotten, was a brief movement of British folk-rock -- much more derived from British folk music than from American rock and roll.

This was a British variation on jazz, often with vocals. By all accounts McCartney got this influence from his father, who was an accomplished amateur pianist who played in this style and taught the style to McCartney.

Their bios are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MANDY HARVEY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jazz singer Mandy Harvey always had a hearing problem. In her youth, she'd had infections that affected her hearing, but only to the point that she had to sit at the front of the class in order to understand the lecture. Her hearing loss was never enough to keep her from pursuing her passion - music. When she entered Colorado State University, she had every intention of becoming a vocal music professor upon graduation. That is until her hearing began to rapidly deteriorate, and, despite medical treatment, she lost hearing in both ears during her Freshman year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the next year she was plunged into a deep depression, but she eventually came out of her funk when she realized she could still play music on the piano and use her perfect pitch to simply remember how to sing the notes. While Harvey says her hearing loss is categorized as &quot;profound,&quot; meaning she can only hear anything over about 110 decibels, she is still able to &quot;feel&quot; the music as so many deaf musicians can, by sensing the vibrations of the bass and rhythms. She also uses her talents as a piano player to watch her favorite accompanist, Mark Sloniker, as he hits notes and chords to help her stay on cue. It's through these adaptations that Harvey has launched a career despite her hearing loss, releasing her debut album, Smile, in 2009, and performing a weekly gig at Jay's Bistro in Fort Collins, Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SEAN FORBES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sean Forbes has been deaf as long as he can remember. He's also wanted to be a musician for just as long. Forbes became profoundly deaf when he developed a severe illness at only one year old. However, both of his parents played in bands, so music was a constant part of his childhood, whether it be from an instrument or from the stereo that was playing hits from The Beatles and Motown. Attracted to the vibrations from the beat, he first started playing the drums around the age of five, but moved up to guitar and bass by the time he was 10. The rap thing came later, though with the genre's use of room-shaking bass, it should come as no surprise he'd gravitate towards the music. After shooting an American Sign Language music video of fellow Detroit rapper Eminem's Lose Yourself, Forbes got noticed by Eminem's studio, 54 Sound, who helped produce his debut EP, I'm Deaf. (You can check out the music video for the title track here.) The EP helped Forbes gain the attention of BMI, who signed him to a record contract earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for Forbes, his career doesn't stop at a record deal. He has also turned his attention to other deaf artists by starting a non-profit organization called D-PAN (Deaf Performing Arts Network). D-PAN helps find and promote creative opportunities for deaf artists in a variety of fields, as well as produces American Sign Language videos of popular songs so that everyone can enjoy the music around them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mentalfloss.com/article/25750/roll-over-beethoven-6-modern-deaf-musicians&quot;&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/25750/roll-over-beethoven-6-modern-deaf-musicians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="938" LastActivityDate="2015-08-15T09:40:22.570" CommentCount="0" />

Discogs also lists the song as being of the Jazz genre and Swing style.

Obviously that's only a difference of one, and likely, once Swing became incredibly popular, bandleaders would have been able to hire more members. In fact, scrolling down on the Louis Armstrong discography site, the vast majority of Armstrong's recording sessions in the next few years included at least 14 people. That's probably when he got into the real swing of it. (See what I did there?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of the way it sounds, the slightly smaller band, and the fact that it was recorded a couple years before Swing got big, I think it's safe to conclude that it's an early Swing song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="431" LastActivityDate="2015-08-20T21:59:22.030" CommentCount="0" />

You really don't need music theory since the central theme of the genre is to free the performers from &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the conventions that music theory analyzes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes that means freedom from traditional song forms. Such as the common structure of bebop having a familiar &quot;head&quot; followed by a succession of solos, usually returning to the head at the end. Free jazz often ditches the idea of song form altogether, often having the players soloing simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes they seem to be freeing the forms from their traditional constraints. Coltrane's &quot;Ascension&quot; for example used a single short line to create, basically, a 'non-head' where all musicians take that line and go where they want for a certain period. Then they move onto solos, each separated by a return to the &quot;head.&quot; They are not limited to measures or even a specific rhythm or beat. They are free to go on as long as they feel. Except for that one very short phrase it is 100% improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing they almost always free themselves from is harmonic structure. Whereas previous jazz had increasingly complex chord structures which are heavily entrenched in music theory concepts like cadences and resolution, free jazz ditched the constraints of chord structure completely. Many free jazz groups lacked any polyphonic instruments such as piano or guitar. For most jazz pianists chord progressions and the interplay between each chord is their stock in trade. This creates a structure which would limit where the soloists can go with their melody. To avoid this they just leave out piano completely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Far from needing a music theory background to &quot;understand&quot; the music, the goal was to free the performers from those type of restraints. When listening to free jazz you are to focus on the &lt;em&gt;expression&lt;/em&gt; of the players - less emphasis on &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they're playing and more on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they are playing it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can seem that understanding free jazz is difficult, but to me the real challenge was getting past the harsh and often cacophonous sound that results from removing the structures we are used to hearing. It requires letting go of your expectations and listening to the performances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="957" LastActivityDate="2015-08-30T03:03:32.763" CommentCount="0" />

The LP was a full length 33 1/3 rpm album, around 45-60 minutes in length (20-30 minutes per side).  The EP was developed from the 45 rpm single format (one song), it had the same format as a single, but several songs instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mixtapes came much later, and were usually non-licensed (bootleg) compilations made by individuals using cassette tapes. (The creation and exchange of mixtapes was an important form of social interaction in the 1980's and 90's, as chronicled in the movie &lt;em&gt;High Fidelity&lt;/em&gt;.) These were most typically one-offs made for personal use, but underground DJs --and later rappers/MCs --began duplicating and distributing them on a larger scale to showcase their skills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In modern times, LPs and EPs are official releases. An LP is a standard length album, an EP (usually) has three to five songs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mixtapes are typically unofficial releases, either because they are unlicensed or because they are being released free for promotional purposes (or both --for example, Frank Ocean's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia,_Ultra&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nostalgia, Ultra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).  Occasionally a &quot;mixtape&quot; will be released officially for sale --in this case, the term is being used largely to indicate it belongs in the same genre as the old street mixtapes.

It speaks of clinging to life and not accepting death, cause we see death as an ending, not as another step of existence. When we die, our matter is decomposed and is transfered to things like worms that feed on us, to the atmosphere in the form of gas, and to the ground and plants that feed on him. We are always moving through the cicle of existence, there is no stillness, only movement and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And as an example, these are the opening lines:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Life is a waterfall&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  We're one in the river&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  And one again after the fall&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A user posted this as an interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The lyrics rush you with several meanings at once.&#xA;  Life is a waterfall, what do we notice about waterfalls?&#xA;  They fall downwards, so life brings us down.

Another thing about a waterfall is that it never exists on its own, it always has a source, like a river or a stream. So if a waterfall is the acknowledgement of the terrible things in the world and letting it bring you down, what could the river be? The time before you realize what goes on in the world, often times this is your childhood. So when we’re one in the river, and we’re one again after the fall, it shows we are ourselves before and after the reality if life hits us and brings us down. Is that true for everyone? No, but think about it. When we were living as children with not a worry in the world, we were ourselves. Then once we began figuring out how the world worked and what happens in the world, we probably had a time of inner conflict where we had to figure things out, and after we figured/figure it out can adjust to it and find ourselves again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interpretation that another user commented on:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Actually, he says in the first line that life is a waterfall, meaning that life is the fall. Before life, we are all part of the calm river, then we are born and live through our life the way a waterfall falls to it’s inevitable end, which reunites everyone in death as we were before life. One with everything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess the main thing here is that there isn't always a wrong or right when interpreting lyrics.

  <row Id="2271" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2270" CreationDate="2015-09-07T18:32:49.223" Score="8" Body="&lt;p&gt;This is actually a very common question that linguistics folks occasionally talk about and/or study. The key is that the singers are not &quot;singing American&quot;.. they are &lt;em&gt;losing their native accent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you are singing a song, there are a number of things that are different from when you're speaking words. The two key changes are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You use a different part of your brain to sing vs. when you speak; singing is more about the tones (like an instrument) than the words.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You are limited by the melody, rhythm, key, etc. of the song. You have to make the word-noises fit the rest of the music.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result of that second bullet, there's less chance for someone to stress the same syllables, exaggerate the same vowels, and even elide the same syllables as they would in their normal accent. According to Josef Fioretta, a linguistics professor at Hofstra University:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“What gets lost in singing are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jcoleman/PROSODY.htm&quot;&gt;suprasegmentals&lt;/a&gt;,” a linguistic term used to indicate qualities like stress, tone, and syllabification, Fioretta said. In other words, a song’s rhythm can limit a singer’s ability to pronounce words, and especially vowels, in his or her usual cadence: “The tone, the intonation, the rhythm of a language; these all get lost in singing,” he says. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/why-dont-british-singers-have-british-accents-when-they-sing#.qbMr4aEgq3&quot;&gt;src&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result is that the singing accent is extremely neutral -- lacking in most of the unique characteristics that distinguish one accent from another. And because of the first bullet point, people learning to sing will just naturally fall into this other accent, usually without even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Andy Gibson, a New Zealand researcher at AUT’s University Institute of Culture, Discourse &amp;amp; Communication also believes the change in accent between speaking and singing is not a deliberate one, nor are artists even aware of the change.  A 2010 study he conducted of singers with speaking accents showed indeed that they were not aware that they sounded any different; they felt they were singing naturally. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/08/why-british-singers-lose-their-accent-when-singing/&quot;&gt;src&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It just so happens that the Mid-Western United States accent is one of the most neutral ones most English speakers are familiar with. It's even the one they teach people to use in broadcasting schools. So when you hear a singer that lacks any &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; obvious accent, your brain will naturally associate it with the most neutral accent you know, the &quot;generic American&quot; one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are also other factors that likely come into play. For example, a lot of British singers probably grew up listening to pop or rock music from the United States, and logically tried to mimic them when learning to sing. Also, a lot of songs are written by people from the US with that &quot;accent&quot; in mind, so other singers have to adapt their style to match. (You can see a similar effect in the US with country music -- even people without a strong Southern twang will often adopt one when singing.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that this doesn't &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; happen. There are a lot of singers that maintain their native accents when they sing. This is largely because they learned to sing by practicing songs that &lt;em&gt;fit their accent&lt;/em&gt;, so they were able to keep their native pronunciations of words intact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also more likely for a non-native English speaker to keep their &quot;foreign&quot; accent when singing English-language songs; again, their learned singing &quot;speech&quot; patterns are sticking with them as they try to adapt to an unnatural language, and they aren't always able to do so. The same would be true of someone not fluent in French or Spanish trying to sing a French or Spanish song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="965" LastActivityDate="2015-09-07T18:32:49.223" CommentCount="8" />

Country music is most heavily influenced by the musical culture of the ancestors of those making the music in that region: that is to say, immigrants from Scotland and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Western&quot; music is &quot;cowboy&quot; music, associated with the culture of those states in the West of the USA (west of the Mississippi River) whose economies were, in the times before oil was discovered and mined, based heavily on the raising of cattle. Western music is most heavily influenced by the musical culture of the ancestors of those making the music: that is to say immigrants from places including Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Western&quot; music includes songs and musical themes from the formerly extremely popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)#Film&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;genre of motion pictures called the &quot;Western&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Many hit &quot;Western&quot; records were originally written and recorded for the soundtracks of movies, featuring famous &quot;singing cowboy&quot; film stars. &quot;Country&quot; music is not nearly as strongly associated with motion pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Western&quot; music also has some Mexican music influences, since many Western films are period pieces set in decades surrounding the USA's war against Mexico. Vast territories switched from Mexican control and population, over to being colonized by people from the USA. Other Western films have to do with more recent times in settings along the border between Mexico and the USA, and the interaction between northern Mexicans and western citizens of the USA. There is little if any discernible presence of Mexican music in &quot;Country&quot; music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the era when &quot;country&quot; and &quot;western&quot; were distinct, approximately from the 1920s through the early 1960s, &quot;Country&quot; music was almost exclusively recorded and marketed out of the city of Nashville, Tennessee. &quot;Western&quot; music was not. It was recorded and marketed out of a much looser and decentralized group of recording centers from Texas to California.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Country and Western&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; was the name of a radio format chart in the USA's &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; Magazine &lt;strong&gt;from 1949 to 1962&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; has always been the &quot;Bible&quot; for radio stations in the USA and the record labels and companies which service recordings to radio stations. Their naming the genre (the technical term in the music business is &lt;em&gt;format&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;genre&lt;/em&gt;) is what established the public's perception of the concept of &quot;country and western&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This reinforces &lt;a href=&quot;http://musicfans.stackexchange.com/questions/1026/why-do-music-genres-exist/1039#1039&quot;&gt;my earlier answer&lt;/a&gt; that what we refer to as musical &quot;genres&quot; all have their source as marketing plans for radio stations, record labels and advertisers who purchased advertisements on radio stations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.countryhound.com/the-billboard-music-charts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Country Hound&lt;/a&gt; website has this to say about &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;'s charts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1944, Country Music received its own chart, a juke box&#xA;  list known as “Folk Records.” The chart was called “Hillbilly Records”&#xA;  for a short period in 1947; then in 1949, it changed to “Country and&#xA;  Western.” Finally, in 1962, “Hot Country Singles” replaced the&#xA;  previous chart titles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key concept is that country music and western music were indeed distinctly different up through the 1940s and into the 1960s, but radio stations and record labels found that both kinds of music appealed to the same demographic group of listeners across the USA. That is why &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; Magazine essentially codified the practice of radio stations combining both in their playlists to reach the same audience, and playing &quot;country&quot; music on radio stations in the American West and playing &quot;western&quot; music in the American South, alike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to listen to &quot;western&quot; music that is not &quot;country&quot; music,&lt;/strong&gt; I recommend the &quot;Western Swing&quot; music of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Wills&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys&lt;/a&gt;, who were at their height in the 1940s. Western Swing is closer in musical style to big band jazz than it is to Appalachian country music.

For example, Ali Campbell of UB40 is an English singer, but is not known for singing in either a British or American accent - rather in a Jamaican accent, because he's singing reggae. That's an obvious example, but you can also hear the reggae influence in voices in other music that is reggae-influenced, from Sting of &lt;em&gt;The Police&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Clash&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the British singers who sing in an obviously American accent are singing in styles that are American in their immediate origin - anything gospel-influenced (soul, and what is now called R &amp;amp; B), or blues-influenced (much of mainstream rock, and what used to be called R &amp;amp; B), for example. Correspondingly it seems that Roger Daltrey, Robert Plant, Adele, Amy Winehouse, and Mick Jagger are all American-sounding, to varying degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once we step outside music that is firmly soul or blues-oriented, we find British bands and singers with more typially English accents - &lt;em&gt;Oasis&lt;/em&gt;' Gallagher brothers (to my ears at least), &lt;em&gt;Blur&lt;/em&gt;'s Damon Albarn, Morrissey, &lt;em&gt;The Proclaimers&lt;/em&gt;, Neil Tennant of the &lt;em&gt;Pet Shop Boys&lt;/em&gt;, Billy Bragg, David Bowie... and when we look at a genre that is arguably at least as British as it is American - punk - we find that some of its American exponents (The &lt;em&gt;Ramones&lt;/em&gt;, to name an obvious example) arguably sing in identifiably British accents!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16" LastEditorUserId="16" LastEditDate="2015-09-13T07:28:46.243" LastActivityDate="2015-09-13T07:28:46.243" CommentCount="2" />

The USA music industry, from the 1920s through the 1950s and ever after, recorded lots of this music onto lacquer and then vinyl records, mass-produced and effectively marketed some extremely popular hit records, making stars out of certain singers, and then exported the records to other nations outside the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, up until the late 1950s, British audiences preferred listening to music that was indigenous to the UK, and possibly from Europe. Very little vocally-oriented music from the USA was popular in the UK, and the styles of music were thoroughly different. American forms like rock and roll, rhythm and blues, jazz, the blues and gospel were not popular in the UK at this time. If you do some research and listen to records that were popular in the UK in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, you will be very surprised to discover that the singers on these records sound thoroughly British. The singing style, particularly in the 1930s and 40s, is markedly almost classical and operatic compared to the way that modern rock and pop music sound. This British music didn't use guitars and didn't have the American back beat, either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In England, starting around 1959, audiences turned their attention to music recordings imported from the USA, which became very popular. I cannot cite a source for this, but it seems to me that this was coincident with the UK's lifting of a longstanding high tariff on all kinds of imported goods. I believe that recorded music from the USA was imported at a much higher rate after this, and the music that was imported sold well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, as I understand it, all radio broadcast in the UK was granted exclusively to the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) which was tightly centrally controlled. The BBC originally didn't play much if any music from the USA, certainly not rock and roll. However, around the early 1960s, illegal, unlicensed &quot;pirate&quot; radio stations began to operate in the UK. They played a lot of music from outside the UK that the BBC was not playing then -- particularly rock and roll. Surely this had something to do with the UK public becoming more aware of music from the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, then, in the United Kingdom, from the early 1960s and thereafter, there was a fad for American music, and the English bands were performing it and emulating it. Musical groups from the Rolling Stones and the Beatles onward started by playing cover tunes: by performing the same songs heard on hit records from the USA, but also by carefully emulating all aspects of the musical and singing styles of those recordings. Their audiences at the time had heard the original records from the USA, and the musicians wanted to sound as much like them as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once these English bands started writing their own original music, they tended to continue to pay tribute to their influences from the USA by singing in the same style they heard on those records from the USA. Audiences had become accustomed to it, demanded it, and paid money for it. Thus, even when these British bands began to write original music, their singers wrote lyrics and sang them in a carefully-emulated American style. Those that did tended to be more successful and sell more records than bands that continued to sing in the British style. This stylistic practice continues to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not lose sight of this: ultimately, when you are talking about the USA singing style found in rock and roll, rhythm and blues, jazz, the blues and gospel you are talking about the style of &lt;em&gt;African-American singers&lt;/em&gt;, with words and lyrics written in the colloquial style and dialog of their community, and singing styles that came from only two sources: rural black workers' blues (&quot;Delta blues&quot;), and African-American church worship music (&quot;black gospel&quot;). Everything from the rock era, even that sung by white musicians in the USA, is in emulation of the core styles of African-American singers and lyricists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the British singers you are asking about all, ultimately, emulated &lt;em&gt;black&lt;/em&gt; singers from the USA, not &lt;em&gt;white&lt;/em&gt; singers from the USA. This is because the white rock singers from the USA were themselves emulating the black singers from the start. Everyone concerned freely acknowledges this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to see an entertaining and humorous portrayal of all of this in a fictional motion picture, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101605/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the 1991 Irish movie &quot;The Commitments&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, in which a group of young Irish musicians in present-day 1990s Ireland create a band to carefully emulate African-American rock and rhythm and blues from the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2015-09-13T02:09:20.747" LastActivityDate="2015-09-13T02:09:20.747" CommentCount="1" />

Bigger drivers tend to reproduce lows easier, and smaller drivers tend to reproduce highs easier (think woofers vs twitters), but the acoustics and mechanics involved are not that simple, so the diameter itself tells us little to nothing.

That in turn suggests some kind of synaesthesia. This is true, but it would be wrong to regard the vision-field as hallucinatory or as a strong, involuntary type of synaesthesia like that of 'colour-hearing'. Rather, it is a weaker, voluntary, associative synaesthesia which will vary in consciousness and activity among listeners. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The vision-field embraces both kinetic and static phenomena.

I have no data to back this up but in my opinion, that we have moved on to purely digital formats contributes greatly to the resurgence of the popularity of vinyl.  Vinylphiles aside, I think many music fans who rather have their tracks in digital form still want physical copy.  When the medium no longer matters, the packaging is the draw.  And of all the formats, vinyl really has the greatest potential for nifty packaging.

Therefore, for people with well trained ears, the quality of Vinyl over MP3 is striking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with most things, as technology progresses it tends to concentrate on convenience, such as an MP3 player with 8000+ songs available at all times. This convenience is impossible with analogue recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over a period of time the quality that was previously on offer (i.e. analogue vinyl) is lost. So, some people in lamenting this decided to 'dust off' their old vinyl and wallow in 'inconvenient' quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly these people realised the quality of the music recordings was so much better on analogue formats that they wanted more and told more and more people thus the 'movement' took off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These days, with the convenience of MP3 style media players, iPods, 'phones, etc. music has become a 'background' to nearly any activity that a person does. In re-establishing Vinyl listening, people now have the 'ceremony' of selecting a record, getting it out of the sleeve, placing it on the turntable and playing it. This then leads them to do nothing else, save listen to the music. In this way people appreciate the music more and it becomes the 'foreground'. In other words they are listening to music for the sake of the music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This can be seen in other areas such as the rise of epicurian, quality food as a 'backlash' against fast, convenient food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="131" LastActivityDate="2015-10-16T11:45:13.053" CommentCount="2" />

Fidelity is the ability of a system to reproduce a signal with the least amount of change. High fidelity means little to no change is being induced, low fidelity means too many change is being induced. Perfect fidelity means the signal is being reproduced perfectly, without change at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your typical vinyl setup &lt;a href=&quot;http://musicfans.stackexchange.com/questions/135/what-gives-vinyl-records-their-characteristic-sound&quot;&gt;induces a lot of change&lt;/a&gt;. From the phase change produced by the RIAA curve, surface noises, low dynamic range (when compared to 16 bit), to inner and outer portions sounding different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Objectively, judging by measurements, in the context of fidelity, 16 bit 44.1 kHz PCM (also known as CD quality) is by far superior to vinyl. You can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_analog_and_digital_recording#Frequency_response&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Myths_(Vinyl)&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://diffuser.fm/do-cds-actually-sound-better-than-vinyl/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2012/02/10/146697658/why-vinyl-sounds-better-than-cd-or-not&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that we established what it isn't about, let's dive into why vinyls can offer a superior musical experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's about the vinyl sound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vinyl's lack of fidelity (again, in relation to CD quality) is a plus in the ears of many. For those people, these added characteristics (&quot;analog warmth&quot;, or whatever you want to call it) are pleasant, so they seek them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some of the &quot;analog warmth&quot; seekers are also high-fidelity enthusiasts. But the more you move into objective high-fidelity territory the less change (the less &quot;analog warmth&quot;) is induced, so the more they invest in equipment the less &quot;analog warmth&quot; they receive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And also about misconceptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not sure why, but the incorrect notion that vinyl has higher fidelity than CD (and other mediums) is widely spread. Many vinyl and audio enthusiasts in general seek vinyl based on that notion. They think they are building a superior system, so getting into vinyl seems like a natural move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, the sound in digital is not getting &quot;pixelated&quot;. As long as you are working within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency&quot;&gt;Nyquist frequency&lt;/a&gt;, the sound is being reproduced perfectly fine. Mathematically, the original and sampled versions are the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And DJs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The DJ scene is in a huge boom. It has never been so easy and affordable. Many of those digital DJs will make the transition to vinyl, which carries a very specific skill set and feel different from playing with CD players or software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the vinyl ritual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vinyls are awesome. They have the waveform engraved, you have to place it in the plate and place the cartridge, select speed, clean everything, that kind of stuff that elevates the listening experience to something more artisan, more involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are big, but slim, so they are great for hanging on walls, or collecting.

I continue to discover a fair amount of music through the old fashioned pathways --the radio and friends/acquaintances.  However, the most productive new-tech source of music I've found is Amazon.com's free music samplers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Released by independent labels, the artists range from big names to complete unknowns.  Since Amazon views your download of these as a &quot;purchase&quot; they are kept for you in a personalized &quot;Amazon Cloud&quot; which you can access from any computer or device with the right software. (Music you purchase digitally from Amazon also goes here automatically, as does, in some cases, a digital version of music you purchase from them in the form of a CD.)  The cloud player is not nearly as good as iTunes.  However, you can always (freely) download actual mp3s of the songs you really like.  Through this method I've discovered a lot of exciting new music I would never otherwise have encountered.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only downsides are 1) finding them, and 2) deleting them from the cloud.  For the first, you need to wade through a maze of Amazon pages (Shop By Department &gt; Digital and Prime Music &gt; Digital Music &gt; Digital Music Deals &gt; More Deals &gt; Albums By Price &gt; Free).  There's a ton of them, and many of them are pretty crappy.  However, you'll soon discover the labels you like best.

Quoted here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Broadly, &quot;cool&quot; refers to a number of post-war jazz styles employing a more subdued approach than that found in other contemporaneous jazz idioms.  As Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill suggest &quot;the tonal sonorities of these conservative players could be compared to pastel colors, while the solos of [Dizzy] Gillespie and his followers could be compared to fiery red colors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(In this context, Dizzy Gillespie is very much associated with bebop.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines, my prof for &quot;jazz harmony &amp;amp; arranging&quot; explained (apocryphally, I think) that &quot;bebop&quot; was so named because you couldn't really express its melodic lines without resorting to something like a fast scat (&quot;beep-baaaahp-ba-dahp-bahp-bah-dahp---daht--dah-daht-bahp&quot; and so forth) to keep up with all the syncopation, rhythmic punctuation, and melodic flourishes involved.  And that's pretty much the opposite of cool jazz.  Cool jazz still has a groove, mind you, but it's in no hurry to get where it's going, because it's cool, man.  Bebop often sounds hyperactive, and cool jazz often (always?) sounds chill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get recommendations of cool jazz albums, I recommend that you go back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_jazz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;that Wikipedia &quot;Cool jazz&quot; article&lt;/a&gt; again.  The range of styles that can be categorized under cool jazz is very broad and overlappy (to wit: all &quot;West Coast jazz&quot; is considered cool jazz by some).

If true, that would be surprising --it's very well composed and performed, especially for this kind of project.  Particularly given that nearly all famous classical music is out of copywrite, you might expect them rather to go with the well-known hits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in this era of global cloudsourcing, it's possible they were simply able to find a good composer and string ensemble somewhere at a low enough price point to make it financially feasible.  It's also possible the orchestra is digital, although to my ear it sounds like live instrumentalists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The style reminds me quite a bit of Vivaldi's famous &quot;Four Seasons Suite&quot; but it definitely is distinctively different from that --not just a clone.

I've always thought that it was just slang for &quot;We don't need education&quot;, for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, if you remember the second time they sing through the verse, it's just a bunch of kids singing it; &quot;we don't need no&quot; is absolutely something a school age working class kid with a Cockney accent in England in the 70s might say instead of &quot;we need no&quot; or &quot;we don't need&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, either potential meaning of the double negative doesn't really make sense for the second line. &quot;We need thoughts control&quot;? &quot;We don't need this type of thoughts control&quot;? Neither of those make sense, at least to me. And if the second line is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a double negative, then why would the first one be? Furthermore, do children need &quot;dark sarcasm in the classroom&quot;? I don't think so either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, the whole song is a rebellion against the school, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mS7ly4dP5o&quot;&gt;when &quot;Another Brick In the Wall&quot; plays in &lt;em&gt;The Wall&lt;/em&gt; film&lt;/a&gt;, Pink has a day dream of the children chanting &quot;we don't need no education&quot;, destroying the school building with sledgehammers and crowbars, setting it on fire, and dragging the teachers out kicking and screaming. To me, this doesn't say &quot;we need education&quot; or &quot;we need a different type of education&quot;, it says &quot;we don't need education at all&quot;. I don't know if the call for alternative education is even something a kid of that age would think of; school is the way that it is and Pink hates it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="431" LastActivityDate="2015-11-25T16:24:19.820" CommentCount="2" />

  <row Id="2673" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2672" CreationDate="2015-12-02T16:31:03.787" Score="8" Body="&lt;p&gt;Most of the &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt; sessions, which began on August 11, 1974, were at Sigma Sounds Studios in Philadelphia, where the producer/songwriter team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff recorded the likes of &lt;strong&gt;The O'Jays&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Harold Melvin &amp;amp; The Blue Notes&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Billy Paul&lt;/strong&gt;, among others, on their Philadelphia International Records label. In addition, famed Philly producer and arranger Thom Bell produced other well-known soul artists, like &lt;strong&gt;The Spinners&lt;/strong&gt; (formerly of Motown), &lt;strong&gt;The Stylistics&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Dionne Warwick&lt;/strong&gt; there. I'd be inclined to say that Young Americans is very influenced by Philly Soul (and previously mentioned artists) for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The musicians and producers Bowie pulled in for the &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt; sessions at Sigma Sounds Studios in Philly could also hint at his influences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Producer Tony Visconti&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tony Visconti had worked with Bowie before (and has worked with him a bunch more since), and before &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt;, most of his production work had been for rock music, specifically prog rock and glam rock; producing the pioneering prog rock band Gentle Giant and the famous glam rock band T. Rex. In terms of soul and funk music, it seems as though &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt; was Visconti's first foray in that area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Producer Harry Maslin&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt; was one of, if not the first producer credit for Harry Maslin, but he had worked as an engineer for a number soul/funk albums in the early to mid 1970s, for artists like &lt;strong&gt;Mandrill&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Young Holt Unlimited&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;The Persuaders&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Pacific Gas &amp;amp; Electric&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Guitarist Carlos Alomar&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At that point in his career, the 30-year Bowie collaborator Carlos Alomar had never heard of Bowie before, and upon meeting him recalled that he was &quot;the whitest man I've ever seen - translucent white&quot;. That was a bit of an aside. Anyway, in the 60s, Alomar played in the Apollo Theater house band, and apparently toured with &lt;strong&gt;James Brown&lt;/strong&gt; for eight or so months, though I'm unable to find any James Brown recordings on which he appeared. He later backed up the likes of &lt;strong&gt;Ben E. King&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Joe Simon&lt;/strong&gt; in the studio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Keyboardist Mike Garson&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Garson had worked with Bowie before, on &lt;em&gt;Aladdin Sane&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diamond Dogs&lt;/em&gt;; his influences were mostly Jazz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Saxophonist David Sanborn&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;David Sanborn, even by August 1974, was already a prolific session musician, having recorded with &lt;strong&gt;James Brown&lt;/strong&gt; (appearing on Brown's hits &quot;Funky President (People It's Bad)&quot; and &quot;My Thang&quot;, among others), &lt;strong&gt;Stevie Wonder&lt;/strong&gt; (appearing on &quot;Tuesday Heartbreak&quot; from &lt;em&gt;Talking Book&lt;/em&gt;), and a slew of jazz musicians, including Gil Evans and Hubert Laws. Fun fact, David Sanborn didn't appear on &quot;Fame&quot; on &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt; (more on &quot;Fame&quot; below), but he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; appeared on James Brown's &quot;Hot (I Need To Be Loved, Loved, Loved)&quot;, which was essentially a rip-off of &quot;Fame&quot; that James Brown apparently recorded due to his increasing irritation of white artists putting out funk songs similar to his. The guitar riff says it all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Bass Guitarist Willie Weeks&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another prolific session musician, bass player Willie Weeks had already played with most notably &lt;strong&gt;Donny Hathaway&lt;/strong&gt;, appearing on his &lt;em&gt;Live&lt;/em&gt; album in 1972. He also played on &lt;strong&gt;Stevie Wonder&lt;/strong&gt;'s &lt;em&gt;Talking Book&lt;/em&gt;, specifically the track &quot;He's Misstra Know-It-All&quot; and &lt;strong&gt;Aretha Franklin&lt;/strong&gt;'s &lt;em&gt;Let Me In Your Life&lt;/em&gt;. He also recorded with a variety of non-soul and non-funk artists, including George Harrison, guitarist Ron Wood, and jazz musician Herbie Mann before recording with Bowie for &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Drummer Andy Newmark&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still another prolific session musician, Andy Newmark had most notably been a member of &lt;strong&gt;Sly &amp;amp; The Family Stone&lt;/strong&gt; for two years and recording on the band's album &lt;em&gt;Fresh&lt;/em&gt; before hooking up with Bowie. Most of Newmark's other work, both before and after &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt; has been more in the rock camp than in the soul or funk camps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Percussionist Larry Washington&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Larry Washington was essentially the house percussionist for Sigma Sounds; he appeared on a bunch of recordings with The Spinners and all the other artists I listed in the first paragraph. For sure, he was the sessions' biggest tie to the Philly Soul sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Vocalist Luther Vandross&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's right, 80s soul superstar Luther Vandross sang back up vocals on &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt;. He certainly paid his dues in the 70s before breaking out as a solo artist with &quot;Never Too Much&quot; in 1981, but his resumé pre-Bowie is actually kind of short. He sang backup vocals on &lt;em&gt;Roberta Flack &amp;amp; Donny Hathaway&lt;/em&gt;, a duet album by &lt;strong&gt;Roberta Flack&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Donny Hathaway&lt;/strong&gt;... and that's pretty much it. After Bowie, he recorded with Chic, Diana Ross, Ringo Starr, Ben E. King, and many, many other, but he was a relative newcomer when the &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt; sessions started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Vocalist Robin Clark&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wife of Carlos Alomar, Robin Clark sang backup vocals with Luther Vandross on a lot of the same recordings in the 70s, though obviously she didn't gain the same level of fame. Her experience pre-Bowie, however, is a bit different. She appeared on the &lt;em&gt;Performance&lt;/em&gt; album by soul singer &lt;strong&gt;Esther Phillips&lt;/strong&gt;, and a few other non-soul and non-funk albums before joining Bowie in the studio for &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Vocalist Ava Cherry&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't been able to find much about Ava Cherry. She had a few solo albums in the 80s and 90s, but I can't really find anything she did before joining Bowie for &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that two songs on &lt;em&gt;Young Americans&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Across The Universe&quot;, were not recorded in that stretch at Sigma Sounds; they were recorded at Electric Ladyland Studios in New York City in one day in January 1975, with John Lennon. Carlos Alomar seems to be the only holdover from above for that session.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One could deduce that the idea for recording &quot;Across The Universe&quot; was because John Lennon was there; as for &quot;Fame&quot;, the story is a bit different. Apparently Carlos Alomar had worked out that riff as for a cover of &quot;Foot Stompin'&quot; by the 50s doo-wop group &lt;strong&gt;The Flairs&lt;/strong&gt;, though in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmKw1ebNxH8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; title=&quot;Foot Stompin&amp;#39;&quot;&gt;listening to the song&lt;/a&gt; I personally don't really hear the similarities. But it's probably safe to say the influences for &quot;Fame&quot; lie in The Flairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this long-winded post answers your question; it's hard to pinpoint the specific artist influences without asking Bowie himself (and at that point it might be tough for him to remember what specifically he was listening to and inspired by 40 years and 15 albums ago), so I think tracing evolution of the musicians he chose to work with and looking at the studio at which he chose to record is a good way to go about trying to frame his influences at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="431" LastEditorUserId="431" LastEditDate="2016-01-19T21:25:01.943" LastActivityDate="2016-01-19T21:25:01.943" CommentCount="2" />

This is because of practical and budgetary considerations; it would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for a film production crew to film a group of musicians performing live on a soundstage. It is much easier and it results in much higher sound quality simply to use a pre-recorded performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as television, the practice of lip-synching goes back to the widespread popularity of television broadcasts, starting in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as live performance, the practice goes back as far as the availability of public address systems and amplification which were adequate to play a recording and make it sound as good in audio quality as what could be achieved with live performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would surmise that the earliest example of a stage performer playing live in concert with a tape-recorded backup was very likely that of guitarist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Paul&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Les Paul&lt;/a&gt; circa 1949, shortly after he obtained one of the first mass-produced tape recording machines available in the Western Hemisphere. He certainly used this technique in his duets with singer &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ford&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mary Ford&lt;/a&gt;, from 1948 through the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starting in this same time period, there began a long-established practice in avant-garde classical music called &lt;em&gt;music for tape&lt;/em&gt; whereby a composer would construct an elaborate studio recording involving manipulations and transformations of &lt;em&gt;found sounds&lt;/em&gt; and electronic elements. In some cases, these compositions were written to be performed by a live acoustic musician on stage, backed by a taped recording. You can find many examples of such compositions with titles like &quot;Sonata for Tape and Piano&quot;, &quot;Music for Tape and Flute&quot; and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lip-synching and miming playing musical instruments on television was made standard practice by the weekly television program &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bandstand&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Bandstand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the USA. &lt;em&gt;American Bandstand&lt;/em&gt; broadcast from 1952 through 1989. All the bands and artists (many quite famous) that appeared on this show were required to mime and lip-synch performances of their recorded hit records. There were a host of similar television shows in many nations of the world, most notably a show in England called &lt;em&gt;Top of the Pops&lt;/em&gt; from 1964 through 2006 -- although it is possible that some of those shows might have permitted some bands to actually perform live from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rock bands &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Who&lt;/a&gt; were performing live in concert with the use of some tape-recorded backing tracks on certain songs going back to the late 1960s. They tended to use the tape recordings for parts of arrangements that were elaborately constructed in the recording studio and would have been difficult or impossible to perform live. However, they would not mime or lip-synch to these parts; it was obvious to the audience that certain parts of the arrangement were provided by a tape machine playing back while the other parts were being performed live by the musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since that time, many musical groups in all styles of music, from classical acoustic chamber groups (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronos_Quartet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kronos Quartet&lt;/a&gt; for example) to electronic synth-pop have performed along with pre-recorded tracks, either on tape or another recording device, or using electronic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;music sequencers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MIDI&lt;/a&gt; triggering synthesizers, samplers and electronic instruments. It would seem that virtually every band centered around synthesizers has made heavy use of pre-recorded and sequenced backing tracks in live performance, from the first availability of synthesizers that could be used on stage, and that goes back to about 1968. With such bands, it has always been difficult for the audience to figure out what parts are being played by live musicians and what parts are pre-recorded or sequenced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is likely that many well-known performing singers surreptitiously used pre-recorded vocals and lip-synched on stage for a long time before it became widely known to the public. The first well-known controversy about this involved the rock band &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Light_Orchestra&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Electric Light Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most famous case of performers lip-synching on stage (and not acknowledging it to the audience) is of course that of the notorious &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milli_Vanilli&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Milli Vanilli&lt;/a&gt; in 1989.

The term &quot;R&amp;amp;B&quot; was first used by the radio and recording industry in the USA to describe &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; recorded music marketed to African-Americans. The term that &quot;R&amp;amp;B&quot; replaced was &quot;Race Records&quot; meaning records marketed to the minority African-American race. &quot;R&amp;amp;B&quot; was not originally a term that any musicians or bands used to describe themselves or their music. So when the term was created it did not describe any genre &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. It described nothing other than a specific marketing plan used by record companies and radio stations in that era.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any artist or band in that era wouldn't spend any time thinking about whether they were &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;R&amp;amp;B&quot;; they would just make music and try to get it sold and earn income through the record business and radio business.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Funk&quot; is a little different, because to the best of my knowledge there was never an actual recognized commercial radio format in the USA called &quot;Funk&quot;. Funk is a distinctive style that originated in the 1970s, usually characterized as African-American popular music with an emphasis on a certain distinctive heavy beat. There were bands that identified &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; as funk bands back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be correct to say that &quot;R&amp;amp;B&quot; encompasses all popular music made by African-American artists and &lt;em&gt;marketed to&lt;/em&gt; the African-American public. &quot;Soul&quot; and &quot;Funk&quot; are each subsets of the larger category of &quot;R&amp;amp;B&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For full background information and references that demonstrate the points I've just made, please read my previous answer to this question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://musicfans.stackexchange.com/questions/1026/why-do-music-genres-exist/1039#1039&quot;&gt;Why do music genres exist?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2015-12-07T00:00:24.630" LastActivityDate="2015-12-07T00:00:24.630" CommentCount="1" />

In general, it has typically meant the style of vocals-oriented pop music most popular among &quot;urban&quot; (black) listeners at any given time --music that may have a large crossover audience, but whose core audience and tastemakers are black.  It has encompassed figures as distinct as the Temptations in the 60's, Bobby Brown in the 90's and Frank Ocean today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soul music is essentially a secularized form of black gospel music, with heartfelt, passionate vocals and a smooth &quot;soulful&quot; sound.  Topics are typically romance, romance-gone-wrong and occasionally social issues.  Major exponents include Ray Charles, Isaac Hayes, Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Funk is a much rougher style characterized by rhythmically complex, syncopated instrumental lines used for percussive effect  (as in the scene in the James Brown biopic where every instrument is described as &quot;a drum&quot;).  Crunchy synthesizers, distorted guitars (played on the 16th note) and brassy horn sections are all typical of funk.  The word &quot;funk&quot; is often used to describe a strong, organic body odor, and the music has some of the same raw, in-your-face connotations.  James Brown, Earth Wind and Fire, Sly and the Family Stone, and Parliament Funkadelic are all big names in the funk genre (recently revived in Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' hit &quot;Uptown Funk&quot;).  Funk and Soul are both subgenres of R&amp;amp;B and one song can fit all three categories at once (i.e. James Brown's &quot;Man's World&quot;).  Since both sub-genres were popular with similar audiences and (arguably) reached a peak in the 70's, there's plenty of overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="92" LastEditorUserId="92" LastEditDate="2015-12-08T17:43:58.067" LastActivityDate="2015-12-08T17:43:58.067" CommentCount="5" />

I believe this for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mirror vain is nearly meaningless and not a phrase used in English. Yes, it can mean that if you're vain, you look into a mirror but that's pretty weak and not up to the standard of the rest of James Hetfield's lyrics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Master of Puppets has the lyrics &quot;Chop your breakfast on a mirror&quot; and &quot;Needlework the way&quot;. The mirror is a reference to cocaine or other narcotics abuse and needlework almost certainly refers to heroin. The whole theme of Master of Puppets refers to the behaviour of musicians in the mid 80s.

Specifically, the central character of the &lt;em&gt;Metropolis&lt;/em&gt; saga, Cindi Mayweather, Monáe's alter-ego, is on the run from bounty hunters because she has broken a law against human/android relationships:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“March of the Wolfmasters” [is] a spoken word piece in the form of an announcement that “Android No. 57821, otherwise known as Cindi Mayweather, has fallen desperately in love with a human named Anthony Greendown,” which means that bounty hunters are now free to hunt her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second track continues this plot from Cindi's perspective; however,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But it is the third track, “Many Moons,” that serves as the suite’s key song.... The video...features Cindi Mayweather as a singing and dancing entertainer at the annual Metropolis Android Auction, a setting that cannot be reconciled with the ostensible plots of “March of the Wolfmasters” and “Violet Stars Happy Hunting!”  ....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The song and video [end] with Cindi falling to the ground, seemingly dead.... [But] in the video, Cindi is one of several androids portrayed by Monáe, all of whom lip sync the lyrics in unison. As Cindi dies, the bulk of the lyrics are voiced by one of her alter-egos, Lady Maestra, Master of the Show Droids, whose veiled footwomen surround the dying Cindi as though to bear her away. Meanwhile, the lyrics, about how “ when the world just treats you wrong / just come with me and I’ll take you home” and how “the old man dies and then a baby’s born” suggest a theme of rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sandifer suggests that the &quot;many moons&quot; of the song and the video suggest the use of time travel as a narrative device to allow the existence of multiple Cindis in multiple worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[The next song,] “Cybertronic Purgatory,” depicts a captured Cindi...[but] “Sincerely, Jane” clearly depicts the real world.... In “Cybertronic Purgatory” Cindi is captured and destroyed, but this only causes her to reincarnate in a new setting entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Suite II: The ArchAndroid Tracks 1-11&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sandifer does not explain much of a narrative in Suite II, and he notes that according to the liner notes, “most of the story does not bear logical sense.” (This is a direct quote from the liner notes.) The liner notes also state that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Monáe is originally from the year 2719, where she was kidnapped, had her genetic code stolen and used to create Cindi Mayweather, and was then sent back in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Sandifer does identify thematic elements in Suite II:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Dance or Die”... develops the specifics of Monáe’s vision of resistance and revolution, with dancing not just serving as a means of waiting for the ArchAndroid, but as an explicit form of resistance and, more to the point, of survival in a fallen and degrading world. (“It’s still a war in all the streets and yes freaks will dance or die.”) This theme carries through the next three tracks, “Faster,” “Locked Inside,” and “Sir Greendown,” each of which...depict[s] their narrators in positions of captivity and longing for some form of release.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Dance or Die”, according to Sandifer, also describes an &quot;overt&quot; war, whereas &quot;Cold War&quot; a few tracks later describes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;a cold war, free of literal violence, where the primary stakes are the maintenance of your own identity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The video for following song, &quot;Tightrope&quot;, introduces an entirely new setting into the suite:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It takes place in the Palace of the Dogs, which is described as an asylum where “dancing has long been forbidden for its subversive effects on the residents and its tendency to lead to illegal magical practices.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The liner notes apparently also state that &quot;Monáe herself is imprisoned in the asylum.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final three songs &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;present characters who have taken the lessons of “Cold War” and “Tightrope” to heart and found internal lives offering some measure of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The first, “Oh, Maker,” is...a mournful ballad from Cindi to her vision of God, which, sensibly for an android, is instead the Maker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mushrooms &amp;amp; Roses&quot;, which closes the suite, is about a club called &quot;Mushrooms &amp;amp; Roses&quot;, “where all the lonely droids and lovers have their wildest dreams&quot; (this is taken directly from the lyrics). The song also introduces &quot;Mary, a cryptically defined figure of attraction within the Metropolis Saga.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Suite III: The ArchAndroid Tracks 12-18&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is not much discussion of plot for these tracks in Sandifer's essay. However, it contain&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;the last mentions of Anthony Greendown in the Metropolis Saga to date...“57821”...is clearly about him, beginning with a description of how “Early each morning he searched for her / til his feet become bloody and tired.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is in Suite III that Cindi Mayweather becomes the messianic ArchAndroid, and Sandifer suggests that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cindi’s ascension to the role of ArchAndroid must also be understood as a turn away from the life depicted back in Suite I and towards an altogether broader perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Suite IV: The Electric Lady Tracks 1-10&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sandifer states that &quot;Monáe has suggested that [&lt;em&gt;The Electric Lady&lt;/em&gt;] is in fact a prequel to The Chase.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sandifer describes the suite as &quot;a swaggering, confident run of songs that can easily be read as embodying Cindi’s revolutionary potential,&quot; though it appears that once again there's not much in terms of explicit plot elements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The accompanying video [for &quot;Q.U.E.E.N.&quot;] posits Monáe and the rest of the Wondaland Arts Society as famous rebels from history who have been captured in suspended animation by the oppressive future regime of Metropolis, but who are broken out by a bunch of rebels armed only with a record containing the single (described in the voiceover as “a musical weapons project,” and as a freedom movement disguised as a song).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also an interlude featuring &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;DJ Crash Crash[, who proclaims that] that “we’re tired of fires, quiet no riots, we are jamming, dancing, and loving. Don’t throw no rock, don’t break no glass, just shake your ass.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next song with an accompanying video is &quot;PrimeTime&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[The video takes] place at the Electric Sheep Nightclub, a bar featuring seductively dancing androids. [It depicts] Cindi as a waitress at the nightclub flirting with a patron, Joey Vice...and finally storming out of the club after she’s harassed by a[nother] patron, culminating in a rooftop meeting with Joey Vice, who takes her to an underground club and subsequently to his apartment, where there are drinks, Chinese food, and seductive looks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dance Apocalyptic&quot; is explicitly one of Cindi's songs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Suite V: The Electric Lady Tracks 11-19&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final suite (so far) is perhaps the least connected to the original science fiction plot of Suite I:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;With the exception of its interlude...there are no sci-fi signifiers anywhere in Suite V.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ghetto Woman&quot; appears partly autobiographical:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is a hymn to a particular archetype of black femininity, one firmly rooted in urban poverty...[and is proclaimed] to be “the seventh wonder reigning over us at night” and...to be “built to last through any weather.” [The song's end is] overtly autobiographical for Monáe, describing her relationship with her own mother and including the lyric “before the tuxedos and black and white every day / used to watch my momma get down on her knees and pray / she’s the reason that I’m even writing this song.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The suite again features DJ Crash Crash, with&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;a trio viewpoints [callers] that are distinctly positioned as outside the oppressed android culture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of these callers explicitly mentions the ArchAndroid mythos:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...he asks “You know, if you guys, in android community truly believe that Cindi Mayweather is not just like the Electric Lady Number One and all, but like also the ArchAndroid? Because of course in the book of...” But more interesting is DJ Crash Crash’s response which is to hurriedly cut him off with a “no, no, not on my show” and hang up on him, an apparent rejection of the messianic vision of the previous album.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sally Ride&quot; and &quot;Dorothy Dandridge Eyes&quot; don't appear to directly relate to prior &lt;em&gt;Metropolis&lt;/em&gt; saga plot elements, but their names do refer to real-life historical figures:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sally Ride [was] the first American woman in space, who died in 2012 during The Electric Lady’s production and posthumously came out as having been in a same-sex relationship....

As to that more specific label, I don't think 'electro' is necessarily a good fit for Chvrches as it refers specifically to a style of electronic funk originating in the early 80's. (It's also used to describe acts who work in other styles, but not in a way that seems to have found broad agreement). 'Electronic', on the other hand, is a much more general term that would be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although it's another broad genre, &lt;strong&gt;synth-pop&lt;/strong&gt; seems perfect for Chvrches if you need a single label.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16" LastActivityDate="2015-12-17T09:40:35.640" CommentCount="0" />

It included the controversial hit &quot;Fuck Tha Police&quot;. Founding members of the ensemble included pioneering rapper Easy-E, as well as Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, who went on to launch successful solo rap careers and are today household names (Dre is also an executive at Apple, his startup Beats Music having been acquired for $3 billion in 2014, and Ice Cube has parlayed his rap success into a Hollywood actor career). A hit biopic film of the group's history called Straight Outta Compton was released this year and became the highest grossing music biopic ever. A meme based on the promotional poster for the film has been used widely used on the internet, including by President Obama. As far as influence and cultural relevance of musical acts in the genre of rap go, there can be no doubt that N.W.A. is among the top.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However I was surprised, because I thought the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was for acts in the Rock and Roll genre, whereas N.W.A. is a rap act. It'd be one thing if it were one of the &quot;rap/rock&quot; crossover acts, but N.W.A. is pure gangsta rap, not near any genre intersection. Why would they be included in a list of influential Rock and Roll acts? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Rolling Stone piece doesn't address the issue, except to say that they're the fifth rap act to be inducted. The first was Grandmaster Flash in 2007. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; doesn't really go into it either, except to say that Fox News ginned up controversy over irregularities in the 2007 induction, making the case that the vote was fixed. But the question of whether the act should've been eligible for consideration at all is not mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this goes without saying, but let me add that I can imagine this may be viewed as a controversial or racially divisive question. I do not intend it to be so, and any such implications should be construed as ignorance on my part, not intentional race-baiting. I would be similarly confused if the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame started inducting Country/Western or Gospel acts, or if the Hip Hop Hall of Fame inducted a purely rock act, without any implied judgment about the relative merits of one genre over another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1564" LastEditorUserId="1564" LastEditDate="2015-12-18T17:31:52.700" LastActivityDate="2016-05-01T20:14:39.763" Title="Why does rap music belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"

There are two definitions of &quot;rock and roll&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first definition is a genre popular of music that originated in the early to mid 1950s and ended in 1959, because of the following events:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The drafting of Elvis into the army (1958)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Little Richard retiring to become a preacher (1959)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The arrest of Chuck Berry (1959)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The scandal of Jerry Lee Lewis marrying his underage cousin (1958)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The death of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper in a plane crash (1959)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola&quot;&gt;payola scandal&lt;/a&gt; that rocked (no pun intended) the music industry, taking down a number of well-known rock and roll DJs, including Alan Freed, with it (1959)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under this definition, &quot;rock music&quot; is a genre of music that began with &quot;rock and roll&quot; and branched out in a number of different ways. This definition also implies that the vast majority of the artists in the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame shouldn't be in there, because they're not, strictly speaking, &quot;rock and roll&quot;. They're a different rock sub-genre, like metal or grunge or surf rock or punk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second definition has the same start date, but essentially doesn't end, and instead somehow becomes the same as the all-encompassing genre of &quot;rock&quot;, spawning all the sub-genres. It should be noted that early 1960s rock sounds fairly different than the rock and roll that ended under the assumptions of the first definition, as surf rock, and soul, the two biggest subgenres to originate around that time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the two different definitions of rock and roll established, there are certainly other acts that aren't &quot;rock and roll&quot; or &quot;rock&quot; that are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Blues&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Albert King&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jimmy Reed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;John Lee Hooker&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Muddy Waters&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reggae&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bob Marley&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jimmy Cliff&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jazz&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Charlie Christian&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Miles Davis&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disco&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bee Gees (they were soft rock in the early 70s, but it's safe to say their disco stuff got them in)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Donna Summer&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pop&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Abba&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Madonna&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then there's the question of other genres, like &lt;strong&gt;Soul&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Funk&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Rhythm and blues&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. Are these &quot;rock and roll&quot;? What about soft/folk rock, like Crosby, Stills, &amp;amp; Nash or The Byrds or James Taylor? Are they &quot;rock and roll&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What makes these artists and genres &quot;rock and roll&quot; but rap not? I don't think anything does, really. I think the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is really more about popular music than &quot;rock and roll&quot; or &quot;rock&quot;, per se; it just started with the 1950s rock and roll era and moved forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we can also look toward the Rock Hall for more information. First, you have their article entitled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rockhall.com/story-of-rock/features/all-featured/2604_planet-rock/&quot;&gt;Planet Rock: Hip Hop is Rock and Roll&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. As further evidence, look towards the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rockhall.com/inductees/induction-process/&quot;&gt;eligibility requirements&lt;/a&gt; for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To be eligible for induction as an artist (as a performer, composer, or musician) into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the artist must have released a record, in the generally accepted sense of that phrase, at least 25 years prior to the year of induction; and have demonstrated unquestionable musical excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We shall consider factors such as an artist's musical influence on other artists, length and depth of career and the body of work, innovation and superiority in style and technique, but musical excellence shall be the essential qualification of induction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that there is no stipulation of genre. All influential artists who have demonstrated unquestionable musical excellence are considered. Also, looking at that page, you'll see&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ballots are then sent to an international voting body of more than 600 artists, historians and members of the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is the most important insight. &lt;strong&gt;600 people decide what &quot;rock and roll&quot; within the scope of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is&lt;/strong&gt;. They have opened it up to fans to vote, but the top 5 artists by fan vote count for &lt;em&gt;one ballot&lt;/em&gt; each. So, essentially, fan votes don't count, and 600 people choose what &quot;music excellence&quot; is and how &quot;influential&quot; and &quot;innovative&quot; an artist was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why you have sub-genres that are seemingly left out of the Rock Hall, like progressive rock (as @JohnnyBones pointed out), electronic music, glam rock, art rock, and others. You also have countries left out, since almost every artist in the Rock Hall is from the U.S., the British Isles, Canada, or Australia; all English-speaking countries. And as you pointed out in your question, an executive decision was made to include the first rap artist, despite the fact that not enough of the 600 people were behind it. Whatever the 600 people say is &quot;rock and roll&quot; is rock and roll in terms of the Rock Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="431" LastEditorUserId="431" LastEditDate="2015-12-21T23:45:02.713" LastActivityDate="2015-12-21T23:45:02.713" CommentCount="6" />

This often includes some or all of the following: extra tracks; demo recordings of album tracks; live recordings of album tracks; alternate takes, mixes, or edits of album tracks; B-sides from album singles that did not appear on the album; DVD content, including music videos. These editions are commonly repackaged, with the new content on a second disc and many feature additional liner notes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Also, some albums are initially released in two editions, a regular retail version and a &quot;special&quot; or &quot;limited&quot; version in distinctive packaging and often including extras such as a second disc, a video DVD, or liner notes expanded into a hardback book. Generally, the special package is only produced for the first pressing or a set number of copies - some are limited to only being sold at one chain of retailers.

Also, it most probably features some extra material to make people buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the page has the following definition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The terms special edition, limited edition, and variants such as deluxe edition, collector's edition or expanded edition, are used as a marketing incentive for various kinds of products, originally published products related to the arts, such as books, prints, video games or recorded music and films, but now including cars, fine wine, and whisky, among other products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it is definitely a marketing &quot;trick&quot; as well. The record companies know that record buyers are interested in extra material, and are willing to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I just cannot resist &lt;a href=&quot;http://genius.com/1873007/The-smiths-paint-a-vulgar-picture/Re-issue-re-package-re-package-re-evaluate-the-songs-double-pack-with-a-photograph-extra-track-and-a-tacky-badge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;quoting Morrissey&lt;/a&gt; here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Re-issue!

I think it's easy in this day and age to undervalue how much of a impact &lt;em&gt;The Shape of Jazz to Come&lt;/em&gt; had. He took the improvisation element of jazz to an extreme. Artists that take music to new levels tend to inspire others even if the music itself is not palatable to the general public. A rock example would be The Velvet Underground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you find it difficult to listen to, I suggest Coltrane's &lt;em&gt;Ascension&lt;/em&gt; which is far more out there and makes &lt;em&gt;The Shape of Jazz to Come&lt;/em&gt; seem almost pop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as the divorce from African Americans, I am not sure how that is supported. I'd love to read the article you mentioned. Jazz was already suffering from the explosion of rock. Dave Brubeck's &lt;em&gt;Time Out&lt;/em&gt; was one of the last significant jazz albums to do well on the charts, and that was in 1959. I think that jazz had divorced itself from all American culture by the 60's and would attempt to reclaim it with fusion, but it never saw the levels of popularity it had once enjoyed. I think what jazz artists began to do in the 60s was challenging for most people, and it became a niche genre, from which it has never truly recovered, even with outliers like Herbie Hancock's &quot;Rockit&quot;. Also, we can't ignore that jazz was an older form of music and Baby Boomers wanted something their own and rock music provided that even when they borrowed elements from jazz, and in some ways took music just as far out as Coleman and Coltrane. Never underestimate the power of not listening to your parents' music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1455" LastActivityDate="2015-12-28T18:43:53.113" CommentCount="0" />

It's technically demanding, it uses exotic chords and rhythms, it's dissonant and improvisational.  Even when covering familiar material, it departs from the canonical melodies and harmonizations.  Perhaps for this reason, while there have always been more pop-oriented, crowd-pleasing versions of jazz, the forms that have garnered the most critical praise are the ones that are furthest from the mainstream, the ones that are most abstract, intellectual and modernist, the ones that are hardest for the casual listener to appreciate.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For proof by contradiction, Kenny G is a talented and popular jazz musician who is extremely &quot;easy to follow,&quot; but few (if any) jazz purists would count him among the &quot;best musicians [in] the jazz world.&quot;  There's a real sense that jazz is not meant to be &quot;easy.&quot;  In contrast, there's no disconnect between being a rock purist and celebrating a three-chord basic-as-dirt barn burner --simple, crowd-pleasing songs are the very heart of rock.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the rarefied nature of experimental jazz may not have helped its popularity in the black community, I personally find it less likely that black audiences were turned off by (black) musicians like Coleman and Coltrane, and more likely that they had already moved on to wholly different styles of music.  Traditionally, the black American music audience drives musical innovation in America, embracing new genres and discarding old ones well in advance of the whiter mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="92" LastEditorUserId="92" LastEditDate="2015-12-28T21:42:41.890" LastActivityDate="2015-12-28T21:42:41.890" CommentCount="0" />

He discarded the habit of holding the left-hand drumstick differently (an affectation left over from marching bands).  He also tuned his drums down, muffled them, and miked them, thus creating the modern rock drum sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had nearly perfect tempo, which enabled the Beatles to weave together multiple takes of the same song in an era before electronic metronomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had an ability to master difficult time signatures, and different musical styles, which allowed the Beatles free rein to experiment musically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web2.airmail.net/gshultz/bryant.html&quot;&gt;http://web2.airmail.net/gshultz/bryant.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also seen speculation that Ringo was the social glue that kept the Beatles from exploding and going their separate ways much sooner --that he worked hardest to keep the group going.

However, according to Mamie Smith Discography, there is an unknown tenor saxophone on the track. Seeing that Hawkins recorded with Mamie Smith two days prior and twelve days afterwards, both also in New York, I'd say that it's definitely a possibility that Hawkins appears on those two tracks as well.

He responded:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are you fucking kidding me? I’ve spent the better part of my adult life being seen in public with little more than a pair of black shorts. I’m like Richard Simmons except way more buff and way more straight. Getting dressed up means wearing a black T-shirt and some really basic dark pants. If that gets me into the What Not To Wear Hall of Shame, so be it. Fuck clothes. The more time you spend worrying about clothes, the less time you have to grab life by the balls. You ever see a cheetah obsess over scarves and pocket squares? No. You see a cheetah bolt 70 miles an hour to take down a gazelle and shred it to fucking pieces. Be the cheetah.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is contrasted on with his views on shoes, taken from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mademan.com/man-of-the-moment-henry-rollins/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;interview with MadeMan.com&lt;/a&gt;.

I learned from my father who was WWII-era Army guy that if you don’t take care of your feet you’re not going anywhere. I’m wearing Danner brand—solid, high-quality boots. A lot of SWAT and military guys wear them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now this is obviously my interpretation of two isolated thoughts of Henry Rollins, but I think he just thinks that fancy clothes and &quot;scarves and pocket squares&quot; give you nothing more than a plain black shirt and a dark pair of pants. Shoes, on the other hand, are different; comfortable or functional shoes help take care of your feet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could his views on clothes be interpreted as a statement of some kind?

But to musicians, &quot;classical&quot; refers only to music from a short style period, approximately the years 1750 to 1820.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past 40 years or so there has been a resurgent movement called &quot;historically-informed performance&quot; which seeks to understand how musicians sang and played their instruments at the time the music was originally composed (hundreds of years ago), and to try to perform the music in those styles, rather than in the style of singing and instrumental playing that most &quot;classical&quot; musicians are taught in the present day. There are singers who specialize in &quot;historically-informed performance&quot; of music from the early Romantic, Classical, Baroque and Renaissance style periods, and yes, they use a lot less vibrato -- precisely because from the best of our historical research, that is how it was done back then, for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the coin, however, you won't find singers today attempting to sing with little or no vibrato if they are singing grand operatic music from the era of Wagner or Verdi or since that time, because that music was composed in such a way that a very big, powerful tone and plenty of vibrato are required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly many contemporary &quot;historically-informed performance&quot; singers who specialize in Baroque and Renaissance music also sing late-20th-century and early-21st-century classical music (called by many names, including &quot;postmodern&quot; and &quot;avant-garde&quot;) because the cleaner, dryer tone with much less vibrato has once again come into fashion for these compositions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally if you are looking for recordings of these singers, you are looking for ensemble productions, such as a recording of an entire opera. These albums tend to be labeled and sorted by the name of the orchestra conductor, not by the individual soloists. Look for conductors, orchestras and groups identified by labels like &quot;early music&quot; and &quot;historically-informed performance&quot; and especially &quot;period instruments&quot;. Then identify the singers on these albums and look for more work by these singers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples from my own record collection:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anything featuring American soprano Teresa Wakim or American tenor Aaron Sheehan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Handel's &lt;em&gt;Messiah&lt;/em&gt;, 1988, conducted by Trevor Pinnock, with the English Concert and Choir.

In is traditional meaning, it is often used to describe 'high art' as well as political and philosophical movements that are seen to advance society in some way. Hence' to be &lt;em&gt;avant garde&lt;/em&gt; in this sense,  you need to be prominent enough in society to persuade society to break with the old ways (or at least, prominent enough in your field to persuade your colleagues to advance!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be &lt;em&gt;experimental&lt;/em&gt; is also to put aside traditional techniques with known results, and to make use of a process in order to find out what the result of that process is.  Unlike &lt;em&gt;avant garde&lt;/em&gt;, being 'experimental' doesn't carry the connotation of moving society forward, or of your work having resonance with other spheres of human activity. In fact, 'experimental' seems &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music#Abortive_critical_term&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;to have been used as a dismissive term on occasion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, the term &quot;experimental&quot; was often applied by&#xA;  conservative music critics — along with a number of other words, such&#xA;  as &quot;engineers art&quot;, &quot;musical splitting of the atom&quot;, &quot;alchemist's&#xA;  kitchen&quot;, &quot;atonal&quot;, and &quot;serial&quot; — as a deprecating jargon term, which&#xA;  must be regarded as &quot;abortive concepts&quot;, since they did not &quot;grasp a&#xA;  subject&quot;. This was an attempt to marginalize, and thereby dismiss&#xA;  various kinds of music that did not conform to established&#xA;  conventions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Used just on its own, &lt;em&gt;avant garde&lt;/em&gt; tends to refer to classical-derived music, whereas &lt;em&gt;experimental&lt;/em&gt; could refer to any music that is breaking new ground (and hence maybe does not currently have another genre label!) including some &lt;em&gt;avant garde&lt;/em&gt; music (the 'dismissive' connotation didn't stick!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Used in combination with other genre labels, &lt;em&gt;avant garde&lt;/em&gt; loses some of its sense of pertaining to an advancement of society, so 'avant garde metal' and 'experimental metal' would largely mean the same thing. Nevertheless, if you're making music in your bedroom for yourself and two soundcloud listeners, it would seem quite pretentious to describe it as &lt;em&gt;avant garde&lt;/em&gt; - better to stick to 'experimental' until you have an audience!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16" LastActivityDate="2016-01-03T12:29:35.170" CommentCount="0" />

The problem you have noted with instruments being panned hard-left or hard-right was very common on many recordings in those days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1960s, most record buyers had monaural (mono) &quot;high-fidelity&quot; or &quot;hi-fi&quot; sound systems and turntables and reel-to-reel tape machines that could only play back monaural (mono) recordings, not stereo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When stereo systems appeared on the market, record labels wanted to sell the new stereo phonographic disks, and the public was eager to buy them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this time radio was also transitioning from mono (on the AM band) to stereo (on the FM band) and people were buying the first stereo radio receivers for their homes and cars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that while recording studios would record the music on multi-track tape (at this time on 3 or 4 tracks, or in rare cases 8 tracks) the recording engineers only had experience in mixing down to monaural, and they would deliver the final album masters as a monaural recording. Recording engineers were just beginning to work with stereo equipment, and they simply had not established any standard methods for mixing stereo sound. Panning instruments or singers' voices hard-left or hard-right was something you find in a great deal of all kinds of recordings from this transitional era, apparently because the mixing engineers had not thought of a better way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most famous example is the albums of the Beatles. The albums, starting circa 1963, were recorded on a small number of tracks that were mixed down to mono. Around 1965, the Beatles' record label asked the Beatles' producer George Martin to make additional re-mixes of the Beatles in stereo. The same Beatles albums could be bought in a mono phonograph or stereo phonograph version. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The stereo re-mixes of the Beatles are notoriously hard to listen to over headphones. All the guitars might be panned hard-right while all the vocals are panned hard left. Or Paul McCartney's lead vocal is panned hard right while all the harmony vocals are panned hard left, for example. History says that at first the producer George Martin did not want to involve himself with stereo, so he supervised the original mono mixes but left the stereo remixes to his employees and did not give much attention to the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Beatles did not record a new album that they intended to be listened to in stereo until the &lt;em&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/em&gt; album in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The primitive stereo re-mix versions of the earlier Beatles albums were the only ones available for people to hear from the 1970s all the way up until 2009 when a multi-CD box-set collection called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_in_Mono&quot;&gt;The Beatles in Mono&lt;/a&gt; was released.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I bought the &lt;em&gt;Beatles in Mono&lt;/em&gt; boxed set, I'm like you: I can't stand to listen to the Beatles' primitive stereo mixes anymore, even though the stereo mixes were the only ones I heard my whole life, for about 40 years, until the mono set was released.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2016-01-04T17:30:04.867" LastActivityDate="2016-01-04T17:30:04.867" CommentCount="2" />

But the music industry and legalities surrounding it are complex.  There are a few reasons why this practice has not become common in the music industry.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, many artists for one reason or another, do not wish to allow their music to be licensed or reproduced in a karaoke version.  I can't think of a compelling business reason for this practice, but there is a long list of famous artists who are on the &quot;karaoke no-fly list&quot; who won't authorize any legal reproduction of their music for karaoke.  Perhaps it's an ego thing where they don't want some inebriated American Idol wannabe butchering one of their songs at a karaoke bar.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the main reason record labels and music producers don't produce their own karaoke or instrumental versions of the songs they hold the rights to&lt;/strong&gt;,  is that it is more profitable for them not to!  Let me explain.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a popular song is released, there becomes a demand for instrumental and/or karaoke versions of the song.  Other folks want to sing the song, so they are willing to pay for an instrumental or karaoke version.  There are several companies who have created a business of &quot;reproducing&quot; popular songs as instrumental or karaoke versions so they can sell copies of those reproductions and make a profit.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to legally reproduce a song, a company or individual must negotiate with the owner of the rights to that song for reproduction rights and distribution rights.  Up front fees as well as royalties as a percentage of all sales are usually a part of the deal.  The rights holder (such as a record label) can sell the reproduction and distribution rights to several different entities who will do the work for them of marketing the reproductions to the target market who wants to buy instrumental only or karaoke versions.  The holder of the rights to writers royalties, will usually be entitled to a small percentage from each sale as part of the overall deal as well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the record label produced an official instrumental only version themselves, the companies who are in the business of replicating and reproducing the songs would not want to buy the rights to reproduce and distribute a song if the original recording (sans vocals) was available for the public to buy.  After all, how can you reproduce a version more authentic than the original?  So the label would miss out on multiple opportunities to make deals with multiple companies to sell the right to reproduce the song and distribute those reproductions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the companies who buy the rights to reproduce and distribute the songs, will spend their own money marketing and selling those reproductions, and the record label and whoever holds the rights to the writers royalties, will get a percentage of every sale.  So someone else is spending the marketing dollars to increase the revenue from the song. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to see what could happen if a record label released an official instrumental version.  They might discover that they could sell many copies.  But for now apparently, they feel there is more money to be made selling the reproduction and distribution rights to the companies that specialize in the instrumental only and karaoke markets.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't really have an answer for why it does not seem to be possible to buy the original producers project files.  It may have to do with a legal question of some implicit right to reproduce the music from those project files without paying for the reproduction and distribution rights.  In other words, if I pay you for your project files, does that give me the right to use those files to produce a derivative work without further payment to you since I already paid for the project files?  There might be a way an implied right of use could be construed that might preclude further obligation for payment of reproduction/distribution rights.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, sale of the project files may not give the songwriter or composer any mechanism wherein they could be paid any writers royalties on derivative works produced through the use of those producer project files.  Perhaps it's like opening an untested &quot;can of worms&quot; or &quot;pandora's box&quot; to use a few cliche's. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may be other reasons as well, but the foregoing provides one explanation.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="197" LastActivityDate="2016-01-06T04:10:19.337" CommentCount="8" />

The record label is a business which has financed the recording project and have a contract with the artist to share a percentage of any profits, in exchange for their having in effect loaned a great deal of money to the artist to make the recordings in the first place. So even if an artist wanted to release something, they actually would have very little say in the matter. A record label looks upon a recorded album or single as a risky investment. A label is only going to release something if they see a clear chance of making a profit from it. If they don't, then they simply will keep the recordings to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The few instrumentals and a cappellas from major-label albums that are out there have usually been leaked out to the Internet without the owners' consent in the first place. It's all quite mysterious, since the people doing the leaking have to be people who have access to the original multi-track studio recordings. Since access to those tracks are carefully controlled by the record labels, nobody's quite sure how any given track makes it to the Internet. It would be up to an individual record label to try to track down and prosecute those doing the leaking; I imagine that often the record label businesses decide that it's not worth the trouble to pursue these cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastActivityDate="2016-01-06T06:47:13.017" CommentCount="0" />

The expression &quot;to raise a toast&quot; means when one person makes a short speech to invite everybody in the room to drink together to honor someone or something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we now know as DJ-ing, which was originally creating club music by manipulating phonograph records on a pair of turntables, originated in Jamaica. (the term &quot;DJ&quot; originaly meant &quot;disk jockey&quot; or somebody who plays records for a living.) At first the Jamaican dance-hall DJ-ing was just spinning records, but at some point a DJ got a microphone and began to talk to the audience while spinning records in order to get the audience excited about dancing and having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story goes that while they were mixing the music, DJs got in the habit of using the microphone to call out the names of friends as they arrived in the club, and to encourage the audience to drink by &quot;raising toasts&quot;. This quickly evolved into the DJs entertaining the crowd by rhyming vocal phrases in time to the rhythm over the phonograph records they were mixing, and this became known as &quot;toasting&quot;. Originally it was only something done live in the club in the moment, as was also the case with the mixing of the spinning phonograph disks on the turntables, but at some point a record label decided on the idea of making new recordings that incorporated music taken from other peoples' already-recorded disks, and having a DJ &quot;toast&quot; over it, and recording it and selling it. This was actually the birth of hip-hop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Toasting&quot; just started out meaning &quot;to make a toast&quot; but in Jamaica it became a part of this new form of music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was Jamaican DJs living in New York and playing music at parties full of Jamaican immigrants that gave rise to American rap and hip-hop. African-American people (those born in the USA) heard what the Jamaicans were doing and adapted it to their own music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;rap music&quot; comes from the USA slang expression &quot;to rap&quot; which means &quot;to talk or converse&quot; and probably comes from the word &quot;rapport&quot;.

For unknown reasons two of Walther’s concerto arrangements remained unfinished, those in D minor and B flat major after works by Giuseppe Torelli. The Concerto in D minor, originally scored for two concertante violins, two »violini di rinforzo«, viola, violoncello, and cembalo, lacks the second to fifth movements, in Walther’s arrangement, and the third movement is lacking in his arrangement of the Concerto in B flat major, originally a Sinfonia in D major for two violins and basso continuo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only further hint from the tracking was, that &lt;em&gt;Concerto del Sigr. Meck&lt;/em&gt; in B minor had this marking: &lt;em&gt;(Vivaldi ?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: I managed to get hold of an additional recording by Janós Sebestyén, booklet text by Carl de Nys, translated by Celia Skrine, dating from 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Three of Walther’s transcriptions are based on concertos by Giuseppe Torelli (1658-1709), one of which is unknown in its original version. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;He also took two concertos from the works of the Venetian Tommaso Albinoni (1671-1750) about whom he wrote a very favourable article in his musical dictionary. The B flat major concerto is No. 5 of Albinoni's Op. 2, but Walther transposed most of it down a tone and even set the slow movement, a heartfelt Adagio, in a lower octave. The F major concerto is Albinoni's Op. 2 No. 4, once again transposed down a tone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The other composers whose concertos are here performed in Walthers organ versions are all much less familiar. Nothing whatsover is known about Luigi Manzia and indeed Walther himself does not mention him in his dictionary. [...] &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In his dictionary Walther ascribed to Luigi Taglietti (1668-1715) various works which were in fact by his brother Giulio (1660-1718). The original of the concerto recorded here [B flat major] has however not been identified. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The original of the concerto by Giorgio Gentili (c. 1668-1710) cannot be identified either. Walther s lexicon mentions some ‘four and five part concertos’ dedicated by this Venetian composer in 1708 to the English ambassador to the ‘Serenissima’, Charles, Earl of Manchester [...]. As to Giovanni Lorenzo Gregori (1663-1745). Walther tells us that he was a violinist in the service of the Republic of Lucca and that in 1698 he had some 10-part concertos engraved there. The full sound of the B flat concerto played on this record makes clear that it is a transcription of one of these. It was probably intended as a sonata da chiesa, and with it Gregori shows himself to have been a worthy successor to the court and church musicians of the Renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1733" LastEditorUserId="1733" LastEditDate="2016-01-27T21:23:09.110" LastActivityDate="2016-01-27T21:23:09.110" CommentCount="1" />

I listened Iron Maiden, Metallica and dozen other bands. As I grew older my interest in that music declined until completely faded out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently I listened to some metal songs I used to like in my teens and suddenly I realized that my distaste to this music is rooted not in the &quot;style&quot; of the music itself but probably because of the heavily exploited theme of evil (violence, chaos, destruction...) in most of the songs. There are, of course, some bands and some songs that do not use the theme of evil but as far as I can see this exception only proves the rule.&#xA;Just look at the names of popular bands - Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So here is the question - is there any kind of research on why evil themes are so attractive to the creators of such kind of music?

I know folks who enjoy other types of music than I do.  I suppose everyone has a different background, a different view on life, different set of experiences, different social circles that they hang with and all of these things influence what type of music and lyrical themes speak to them on a personal level.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason these bands you describe are successful in building a fan base and selling out their shows, is that there is an audience for the type of music they create and perform.  You alluded to the likelihood that these musicians made a conscious decision to write songs about subject matters that you don't personally feel compelled to immerse yourself in.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the &quot;Death Metal&quot; genre is not the type of music I choose or prefer to listen to, I cannot &lt;strong&gt;personally&lt;/strong&gt; tell you why some folks do prefer that type music.  The ones best qualified to answer that question would be those that do enjoy or prefer or perform the type music your question is about.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I can say is there is a large fan base for many of the bands you mentioned and others like them.  &lt;strong&gt;Music is entertainment for most of us and provides an escape from reality, a release of emotional tension and for some, an adrenaline rush.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been many popular movies featuring mass murderers and depicting gruesome killings.  There are many popular movies about evil forces from the spiritual realm.  I don't believe it's fair to categorize the folks who watch those type movies as inherently evil people.  Perhaps they just enjoy being taken on an emotional journey into fear or excitement.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best way to discover the answer to your question is to go to a concert featuring the type music you are wondering about.  Talk to the fans.  Talk to the musicians.  Keep an open mind and try to truly understand what they tell you.  You might be quite surprised and enlightened. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Wheat Williams referenced a documentary about the subject which may shed some light on your question if you want to watch it.

And it can't be answered by single persons alone. But I dare to write my share here, because I was and still am into several flavours of Metal including DM. And it was a significant part of my cultural development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First I want to share some general opinions for which I do not have any proof whatsoever. Then I'll try to explain my personal perception.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess we have to go back into history. Metal is an offspring of Hard Rock or rock music in general. Emerging music styles frequently are a way for their fans to differentiate or even isolate themselves from the mainstream. And music mainstream often is a pars pro toto for a whole society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMO as the influence between musicians and their fans is bidirectional and often immediate, the bands bring up the style and content that allow the fans to use the music for their identification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While Hard Rock turned against the philistinism and social conventions Metal had to part company at least partially, to make its own point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I'll change to my personal view. Born in the middle of 70ies I grew up during the apex of cold war. I grew up in a country which many strategists predicted to be the first tactical nuclear battlefield when the cold war once turned hot.&#xA;Surrounded by a heavily industrialized economy environmental pollution was omnipresent and the doomsday clock was on three before 12. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My whole youth was infused by dystopies. While I clearly percieved the menace, I could watch the ones in power just go on as they ever did, apparently ignoring all threats and dangers they piled up on the surface of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was no positive imagination of the future one could easily grasp in the 80ies. So my mood as a teenager was clearly dystopic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As it comes with teenage it is not easy to utter such perceptions and to live with while considering the very own existence somehow futile and powerless. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One method of coping with dystopic and isolating feelings is to suck up similar views. This can be music, books or movies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me it were the various flavours of Metal which provided a high percentage of social crticism and dystopic depiction wrapped in rough language and sound able to support that mood I was forced into. I guess many of my friends felt similarily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look closer to the lyrics, you can observe that many deal with great problems of mankind and apply heavy criticism on it. I did not expect the music to change the world, but I felt good listening to it when it confirmed my view on the world in political and social perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This made the music more earnest to me than the average popmusic lovesong and eventually more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my resumee is: Apparently evil lyrics in Metal and especially Death Metal are based on the sociocritic attitude of the genre. This was fostered by the bad future in the 80ies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1796" LastEditorUserId="1796" LastEditDate="2016-01-31T10:24:04.037" LastActivityDate="2016-01-31T10:24:04.037" CommentCount="2" />

The basic principles of this code are a fatalistic world view dominated by a vision of a chaotic world in which suffering and pain are the dominant experience. Hedonism provides a brief escape, but, in the end, everything ends in chaos and disorder. She reads this code as the &quot;curdling&quot; of the hopeful anti-authoritarianism of the 1960s hippie and psychedelic subcultures. Her book catalogues the metal code, looking at lyrics, dress, imagery, and music, and she does detailed readings of individual songs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure a pdf has been bootlegged online. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="174" LastActivityDate="2016-02-02T02:54:05.010" CommentCount="0" />

Cream of course pre-dated Blind Faith by three years, as Blind Faith was formed from the breakup of Cream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So since the term &lt;em&gt;supergroup&lt;/em&gt; was coined by a famous rock music journalist in 1969, I think the term is best applied only from 1969 forward, and generally in the context of commercial, popular music. If you get outside of that, then you are trying to apply a 1969 rock music term to musical groups to which this made-up term was never actually applied by anybody.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you want to talk about a musical group using the generally-accepted definition that it refers to a group which consists of musicians recognized as well-respected virtuosos with reputations that preceded them before they joined the group, then the earliest example in music history that I can think of is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannheim_school&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Court Orchestra of Mannheim, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, formed in 1720 and active for another 60 or 70 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A list of other notable examples in Western music history might include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentine_Camerata&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Florentine Camerata&lt;/a&gt; which formed in 1573.

Get together a group of musicians who are all previously well-known as famous virtuosos, record an album in a day or two or three, &lt;em&gt;voilà&lt;/em&gt;, a supergroup.

However, I think it's easy to argue against that, as the band that Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker were in before Cream, The Graham Bond Organization, didn't seem to have any chart singles or albums, and if that's what makes a group &quot;successful&quot;, that would mean that the band wasn't successful. Though Clapton &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; achieve success with the Yardbirds, I think this excludes Cream using your definition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving on to Wikipedia's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_supergroups&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;list of musical supergroups&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to contain mostly &quot;rock&quot; groups, the first &quot;supergroup&quot; listed chronologically is &lt;strong&gt;The Steampacket&lt;/strong&gt; (1965). However, I think they're only listed due to the presence of Rod Stewart (who wasn't really well known yet) in the band, and it should be noted that they didn't even release any albums while they were together; they operated as a live act only. Some of the members achieved great success &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the breakup of the short-lived The Steampacket, but it doesn't seem like any of the members achieved much success with their previous groups, so I think this excludes The Steampacket as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the first two alleged &quot;supergroups&quot; crossed off the list, this brings us to &lt;strong&gt;Crosby, Stills &amp;amp; Nash&lt;/strong&gt;, the members of which were all in successful groups, each currently in the Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame, before coming together as a trio in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;David Crosby was in The Byrds for about three and half years, racking up four Top 25 Billboard albums and two #1 singles, &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; and the Bob Dylan cover &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; during his tenure with that group.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stephen Stills was a member of Buffalo Springfield before joining CSN. He wrote their biggest hit, &quot;For What It's Worth&quot;, which was a #7 single. The band also contained Neil Young, who would occasionally record with CSN as Crosby, Still, Nash &amp;amp; Young.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Graham Nash was in The Hollies, a Manchester group that achieved great success in the U.K., with 13 top ten singles and five top 25 albums in that country before Nash's departure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd be inclined to say that &lt;strong&gt;Crosby, Stills &amp;amp; Nash&lt;/strong&gt; was the first rock supergroup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Jazz&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As @WheatWilliams stated, it's difficult to pin down the first jazz supergroup, since group membership would change frequently and its improvisational nature allowed for albums to be recorded within a few days. That having been said, the general path towards success for most jazz musicians was to join with an already well-known bandleader, and after finding success with them, set out on their own to form their own group. This means that all previously successful musicians rarely came together for recordings or performances, and when they did it was usually reunions of groups at Festivals after most or all members had achieved success on their own as bandleaders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So with the caveats out of the way, the first Jazz supergroup that I've been able to find, fitting the definition of all members having been successful before joining together, is &lt;strong&gt;The Quintet&lt;/strong&gt;. Though they only performed together once, on May 15, 1953, the live album resulting from that performance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_at_Massey_Hall&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jazz at Massey Hall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has been inducted into the Grammy Hall Of Fame and is in NPR's &quot;Basic Jazz Library&quot;. The five members of The Quintet:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dizzy Gillespie (trumpet)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Charles Mingus (bass)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Charlie Parker (alto sax)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bud Powell (piano)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Max Roach (drums)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gillespie and Parker were bebop pioneers and are widely considered two of the greatest and most influential jazz musicians at their respective instruments. Mingus had already attained success recording and performing with Duke Ellington and Parker and had co-founded Debut Records with Roach the year earlier. Roach had drummed for Miles Davis on &lt;em&gt;Birth Of The Cool&lt;/em&gt;, Coleman Hawkins on &lt;em&gt;Body And Soul&lt;/em&gt;, and many, many others before hooking up with the quintet. And finally, Powell had played with Parker before and already had a successful tenure as a bandleader before recording with The Quintet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though I wouldn't be surprised if there were supergroups formed earlier than &lt;strong&gt;The Quintet&lt;/strong&gt;, for now I'll deem them the first jazz supergroup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="431" LastEditorUserId="1599" LastEditDate="2016-02-07T19:16:51.517" LastActivityDate="2016-02-07T19:16:51.517" CommentCount="3" />

So how do we know when a passage is a fugato and not a fugue itself? Well, keep listening. A canonical fugue (as Bach's fuges from Well-Tempered Klavier, Art of Fuge, etc...) has some fundamental parts that give the piece the structure of a fugue. Exposition, episode, development...all of this is needed for a fugue to be considered as one. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let's go back again to Beethoven's little passage on the op. 106 Sonata. As you said, judging it only for its length (no more than five bars), there's little to say about it. It's a contrapuntual passage, two voices, that seem actually independent one from the other, but that's very far away from becoming a fugue. There isn't a neat exposition of the voices, oposed to what happens when the &lt;em&gt;real fugue&lt;/em&gt; is developed a few bars later, where each voice is clearly independent and developes throughout the music. If I had to name that passage, I would say it is closer to the subject of a Bach's Invention than a fugue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, why would Beethoven compose something like that? To be honest, I don't know. Maybe he needed a motive to finish with the dramatic atmosphere he created during the third movement, and if that was his porpose, he did it quite well. Or maybe he was just trying to develope a subject for a fugue, but he was not convinced at all, but instead of moving to another subject he decided to leave it there as a premonitorious passage of what it would come later. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to answer your final question, I have to say that I couldn't find in any other composer such a short passage composed in fugal style. Beethoven's op. 111 Sonata has some parts in the first movement where you can see contrapunctual style as well. An on the other hand, the Gross Fugue, the first movement of his op. 131 string quartet, or the last movement of his 9th Symphonie are fugues respectively, but none of then as short as that little passage on the Hammerklavier Sonata. The closest I've found, is &#xA;from Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor. I think it's the best example of what a fugato is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdKED35aCLc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an audio from Daniil Trifonov playing it where the fugato passage starts. Though it's not my favourite version, I hope it helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1566" LastActivityDate="2016-02-09T18:05:38.150" CommentCount="1" />

A genre might collect songs that have a similar sound solely because they were all made in a similar time and geographic location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the short answer to your question is: if you can find songs tagged ”Genre: Soundtrack” then yes, Soundtrack is really a genre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces&#xA;  of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The shared tradition and set of conventions of the music in the Soundtrack genre is that the songs were all made to be the soundtrack of some visual media. That affects every aspect of the construction of those songs. For example, they tend to have muted lead parts compared to other genres because they don’t expect to have 100% of your attention. They tend to ebb and flow in a way that follows the ebb and flow of storytelling. They tend to have elements that build excitement or release tension along with the visual media they were written to accompany.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;genre should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style&#xA;  or &quot;basic musical language.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is entirely consistent with the previous quote. Muting lead parts so as not to interfere with spoken dialog is part of the “basic musical language” of the Soundtrack genre. Using contrasting soft and loud parts, using a lot of textured strings and other pads, and builds and releases are part of the “basic musical language” of the Soundtrack genre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you are conflating “musical language” with “music theory.” Not the same at all. Musical language is much broader and includes elements of the performance and production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, in the Dance genre, the music was all made for dancing. A danceable beat is part of the musical language of the Dance genre. But 2 arbitrary dance songs aren’t necessarily similar from a music theory perspective. One might have a strong quarter note feel and be written in a major scale, while another might have a triplet feel and be written in Egyptian scale, and both might use entirely different instrumentation. You could give the sheet music — which typically does not even include the drum parts — for both songs to a musical genius and they might not be able to tell you that both songs belong to the Dance genre. Music theory is just paper. It is less important than the performed music, not more important. The musical language that defines a genre includes aspects that don’t exist in music theory. For example, the Grunge genre refers in part to using a particular kind of guitar sound that was popular in Seattle in the 1990’s. Guitar sounds are not part of music theory, they are part of performance and production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way you can see that genre does not matter to music theory is that you can give the sheet music for a particular song to a band made up of skilled musicians and say “play this in Jazz style” and they can play you a Jazz version of that song. Then you can say “play it in Bluegrass style” or “Disco style” and so on and they can play the song again for you from the same sheet music in those different genre styles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, most genres are named by people who are completely ignorant of music theory. Often they are listeners and DJ’s and music critics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you have to take them with a grain of salt. They are informative, not scientific. But you can make a playlist of all Soundtrack or all Jazz and it is markedly different than a playlist of just random arbitrary songs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="Simon White" LastActivityDate="2016-02-10T16:39:04.377" CommentCount="0" />

Over a century before Bach, Italian and English composers were publishing love songs known as madrigals, that a small group of people (or a solo singer with a lutenist) could sing. These were the &quot;pop songs&quot; of the day, and they led to the development of opera. Meanwhile, others such as Praetorius were publishing collections of simple folk dances (Terpsichore, 1612). Most people during this time also attended church services, where they would be regularly exposed to sacred music. Contemporary to Bach, Telemann published a periodical containing sonatas that were accessible to amateur musicians called &quot;Der getreue Musikmeister&quot; (The Faithful Music Master), and this is hardly a unique case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You dismiss operas, but I think opera attendance was likely more popular than you give it credit for. You didn't have to be some high-falutin' well-to-do nobleman to get into an opera. These &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; the popular entertainment of the day, much like attending a movie theater today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was also, at least in England, an avid market for purchasing published transcriptions of opera music. Since there was little-to-no copyright law at the time, these transcriptions need not be officially authorized by the composer or opera-house. To illustrate this last point, I found a doctoral thesis, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/31721/1/Churchill_SaraAnne_L_201111_DMA_thesis.pdf.pdf&quot;&gt;The Tradition of Transcription&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by Sara Anne Churchill (University of Toronto, 2011) which discusses the phenomenon. I'll quote the first paragraph of the abstract here to let her make the basic point, and avoid potential link rot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Eighteenth-century London was a hotbed for instrumental arrangements, and many of these works were derived from the operas of George Frideric Handel (1685-1759). Thirty-one of his operas, in whole or in part, were arranged for recorder or flute, and there were over seventy keyboard transcriptions of the overtures to these operas. While the transcriptions of Handel overtures have been thoroughly examined, opera aria transcriptions have never received an appropriate level of study and analysis. &lt;em&gt;The Lady’s Banquet&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Lady’s Entertainment&lt;/em&gt; provides an excellent starting point. Not only does it include numerous opera aria arrangements, but its volumes were re-issued several times, suggesting a wide circulation. Its study raises a number of issues, including publication and authorship of Handel transcriptions, gendered music of the eighteenth century and analysis of opera transcriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you weren't able to play music yourself, you likely knew someone in your circle of acquaintances who could. &lt;strong&gt;In short, before music could be recorded, all music was experienced live, and was therefore the result of people getting together and playing music, in whatever circumstance might call for it&lt;/strong&gt; -- whether that be a soldier's march, a tavern drinking song, a mother's lullaby, a church service, a love song, a folk dance, an opera, or just getting together with friends and &quot;jamming&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward now to the early 20th century, and it's this very culture of live music performance that John Philip Sousa fears is in danger of being lost, due to the advent of music recording machines. He writes, with what he admits may seem an alarmist tone, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://explorepahistory.com/odocument.php?docId=1-4-1A1&quot;&gt;The Menace of Mechanical Music&lt;/a&gt; (1906):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Right here is the menace in machine-made music!

The cheaper of these instruments of the home are no longer being purchased as formerly, and all because the automatic music devices are usurping their places.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And what is the result? The child becomes indifferent to practice, for when music can be heard in the homes without the labor of study and close application, and without the slow process of acquiring a technic, it will be simply a question of time when the amateur disappears entirely, and with him a host of vocal and instrumental teachers, who will be without field or calling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;, he says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These talking machines will ruin the artistic development of music in this country.

It was an oral tradition of freely improvised music. Nobody would have written it down, and even if anybody had, all subsequent performers would modify a song or melody and perform it differently every time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was not until the early years of the 1900s that anybody attempted to write down or publish a 12-bar blues. That goes to the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._C._Handy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;W. C. Handy (1873 - 1958)&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &quot;Father of the Blues&quot;, and his first work in this area dates to 1902. But in this regard, Handy was merely being a musicologist, writing down and reporting on an oral tradition that had been around for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;published&lt;/em&gt; piece of music in the 12-bar blues style was &quot;Memphis Blues&quot; in 1912&lt;/strong&gt;, a composition by W. C. Handy in the style of the folk blues he had studied. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Memphis_Blues&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/VmOp8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/VmOp8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we now know as the 12-bar blues is generally regarded as first appearing around the end of the 1800s in the region of the United States of America known as the Deep South. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on Blues&lt;/a&gt;). However, the blues wasn't invented at one point in time by one composer. It evolved, and its evolution went on for &lt;em&gt;centuries&lt;/em&gt; before academic people took note of it and wrote and published articles describing it. It goes without saying that there were no audio recordings made until circa the 1920s when the technology became available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a difficult topic to discuss, but the history of the 12-bar blues is entirely bound up in the practice of slavery in what is now the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The blues comes from the United States of America, entirely from people whom we today call African-Americans: those people who were brought from West Africa to the New World as slaves, and their descendents. Everything about the blues can be traced to West African music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first recognized form of the blues is the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_holler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;field holler&lt;/a&gt;&quot;: a work song sung by African-American slaves (and after slavery formerly ended, as sharecroppers or other kinds of laborers), as they worked in the fields. Wikipedia cites the first written description of the &quot;field holler&quot; as being published in 1853, so this would be during the time of slavery in the USA. (Slavery formally ended in 1865.) However it is almost certain that the field holler has been sung by slaves in the fields of what is now the USA since the first slaves were brought to work there, and that would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States#Colonial_America&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;circa 1619&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The field holler is often in a kind of &lt;strong&gt;call-and-response&lt;/strong&gt; structure, and this is where the &quot;12-bar&quot; part comes in. In some field hollers, one person sings a four-bar phrase. Then the other workers alongside him join their voices together and sing the phrase back, like an echo. Then the leader sings the concluding (contrasting and different) four-bar phrase. This is often sung in the rhythm of the manual labor being done, in order to assist the workers in coming together to coordinate their muscles in moving or lifting something, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The metrical structure of the 12-bar blues, is an important distinction: It has a structure of A A B, four bars each, and this appears to be a West African structure. In contrast, Western European folk music, that of the White people in what is now the USA, almost always had a symmetrical 16-bar structure of four groups of four bars, and could be A A B A or some other structure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ever since White people enslaved African people, the music of one group began to influence the music of the other. About forty years after slavery formerly ended, &lt;strong&gt;American jazz&lt;/strong&gt; began to develop; jazz would have never existed without African-American musicians and their musical skills instruments and traditions, being exposed to and gaining access to White Western European music and musical instruments, and using these resources to create something completely original and unique to the United States of America. The blues is of a similar vein.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slavery was horrible, detestable and utterly wrong, but the music of the United States of America as we know it (and many other places in the New World) would not exist without the African slaves and their descendants having applied their musical creativity to the musical resources brought to them by their White slave owners, and all the interactions between the races that happened since slavery formally ended, up until today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2016-02-15T06:10:00.810" LastActivityDate="2016-02-15T06:10:00.810" CommentCount="6" />

The hollow-body archtop guitar was originally designed and built to be an entirely acoustic instrument, and early jazz bands used them that way for strumming rhythm -- no pickup, no microphone, no amplifier. Bending notes on such a guitar is very difficult and does not work well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/7MdcC.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/7MdcC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The great Freddy Green, of the Count Basie Orchestra,&lt;/em&gt; came up in the 1930s. He only ever strummed chords, and only ever played a completely acoustic hollow-body archtop guitar, with very heavy round-wound strings and high action, in the middle of a big band with horns. He never plugged in, and continued to play that way until his retirement at the end of the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hollow-body archtop guitar was the first kind of guitar to have a pickup attached to them, going all the way back to the late 1930s. But even after pickups were added, players tended to continue to use very heavy strings (and flat-wound rather than round-wound strings, which produce a very different tone) and the same playing techniques they used when the instrument was purely acoustic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CvdsN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CvdsN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Kenny Burrell on a really big hollow-body archtop guitar with really heavy strings, probably in the early 1960s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the mid-1950s the solid-body electric guitar (Fender Stratocaster, Gibson Les Paul) and the semi-hollowbody guitar (Gibson ES-335) came into use in jazz, although many players to this day still use the older hollow-body archtop design. With solid-body electric guitars in jazz, players began to use the same light-gauge round-wound strings as the rock and country players, and to adopt some of their techniques in string-bending. A solid-body guitar with light-gauge round-wound strings enables playing notes with much longer sustain, and this in turn makes it feasible to hold notes longer and bend them. You can hear a lot of jazz fusion from the 1970s and 1980s where the players make use of string-bending. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5uNw3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5uNw3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mike Stern in the 80s playing a solid-body electric guitar with light-gauge strings, and bending them, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since that era, much jazz guitar has gone back to a more traditional 1950s and 1960s approach, using the hollow-body archtop and much heavier strings. But you can find exceptions to the rule among different players in every decade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2016-03-05T04:45:25.840" LastActivityDate="2016-03-05T04:45:25.840" CommentCount="0" />

The first was a single appearance at the Live Aid festival in London in 1985, where Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones were joined by Phil Collins and Tony Thompson on drums and Paul Martinez on bass guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second public appearance under the name of Led Zeppelin was the 2007 concert to honor the death of Ahmet Ertegun, and the lineup for that concert was Jason Bonham, John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, this person you met in church must have been lying to you. He never performed with Led Zeppelin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, since 1980, the three surviving members of Led Zeppelin have performed as solo artists and as members of various different bands, never under the &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; of Led Zeppelin, but at various times they would perform certain Led Zeppelin songs as part of their concerts. So it may be possible that this person you met has performed with a former member of Led Zeppelin on a tour at some point in time. Yet I am certain that this could not have happened &lt;em&gt;under the name&lt;/em&gt; &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;. This is just too well-documented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, ZZ Top has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; performed with any guitarist other than or in addition to Billy Gibbons, their founder. ZZ Top in live performance and tours has only ever consisted of the trio of Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill and Frank Beard. They have never made use of any other musicians within that band in live performance. If this person told you that he had performed as a touring band member in ZZ Top, he was lying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally in the world of rock and roll you find people who tell tall tales and lies about their experiences as a musician. Maybe this person played in a little-known band at a festival where there were 16 bands and one of the headliners was ZZ Top. In later years this person would claim, &quot;Yeah, I played with ZZ Top&quot; when all he meant was that his forgotten band was on some different stage in the festival on a day when ZZ Top were not even there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for him to claim that he performed as a member of Led Zeppelin or ZZ Top is particularly egregious; everybody knows that Led Zeppelin only ever toured as a four-piece, and ZZ Top only ever toured as a trio, and we know who each of those members was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user546" LastEditorDisplayName="user546" LastEditDate="2016-03-15T00:42:17.297" LastActivityDate="2016-03-15T00:42:17.297" CommentCount="4" />

  <row Id="3161" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="122" CreationDate="2016-03-16T15:16:44.710" Score="0" Body="&lt;p&gt;I laughed a bit when I first read this question - I'm not sure you understand its scope. One could literally write a &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt; about this album and its meanings. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, you absolutely must not take this lyric (or its song) out of context as you interpret the album.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This album, like most art (and the moon), revolves around many concepts and ideas. Interpretations may vary. There are many, and ALL of them are potentially correct. A work of art like the Dark Side DOES NOT have a single 'point.' Its meanings are numerous and subjective. However, here is the one I prefer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the album, we hear the lyrics&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All you touch and all you see&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is all your life will ever be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run, rabbit, run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dig that hole, forget the sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When at last, your work is done&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above is a major message constantly regurgitated to us by society. Work, work, work, work, work. Just work for the good of the whole. Your life consists only of your perceptions and actions, and it has no special meaning whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This sets the stage for a statement about the nature of the human society in which we live. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Time / Breathe (Reprise)&lt;/em&gt;, they further reiterate this dull, clocklike, mechanical existence. When the lyrics '&lt;em&gt;Home, home again&lt;/em&gt;' appear, the subject is essentially taking a break from reality for a moment returning to the dwelling of his personal thoughts and internal existence. Presumably, this break continues throughout &lt;em&gt;The Great Gig in the Sky&lt;/em&gt;, after which further statements about the superficial and sometimes hostile nature of society are made in &lt;em&gt;Money&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Us and Them&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any Colour You Like&lt;/em&gt; is harmonically related to &lt;em&gt;Breathe&lt;/em&gt; and its Reprise - this implies that another break from society / reality is being taken. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we come to the final moments of the album, the clocklike existence of the exposition is about to come to an end. It is difficult to put this into words, but I will try. The idea is not to over-interpret every word here, but to get a general idea for what they might be saying. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You shout, and no one seems to hear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you've clearly perceived something that was loud or monstrous in nature (note that the cloud is REAL and concrete - not an insane musing), you are shouting about it, and no one &lt;em&gt;SEEMS&lt;/em&gt; to hear you. Do they actually hear you? Perhaps they do, but they are too caught up in their monotonous existence to acknowledge your shouting. This may also imply a certain apathy by the people (society) to whom you are shouting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'll see you on the dark side of the moon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first part of this is an idiom, commonly used in a few different variations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He plays to a different tune.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He marches to the beat of a different drum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This implies that, though the subject may or may not be insane, his perception of reality and / or behavior is decidedly different from that of the rest of society. &quot;The band you're in&quot; may imply that this unique behavior / view of reality can apply to a group or collective at times as well as to the individual, or it may be in reference to multiple aspects of self. So if you march to the beat of a different drum,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;dark side of the moon&lt;/em&gt; is the same idea as was presented in the lines about shouting about something you've seen, and no-one seeming to hear you. Society either cannot see what you are seeing (in the same way that we cannot see the dark side of the moon), or they are so caught up in their lame, clockwork existence that they are unwilling to acknowledge you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has so many implications - spiritual, religious, societal, psychological. It works on many levels. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And at the very end of the album, we are assured that no matter what we perceive or do, be it right or wrong - sane or insane - that everything is working in tune. The clockwork, apathetic, monotonous existence of society, the moon, the Earth, and indeed everything in existence - both concrete and abstract, seen and unseen - all work together to create and sustain the reality in which we live. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is both a lamentation and a warning. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it is also a message of hope. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2038" LastEditorUserId="2038" LastEditDate="2016-03-16T15:43:43.973" LastActivityDate="2016-03-16T15:43:43.973" CommentCount="1" />

Here is what was happening in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Page is on record saying that he had felt dissatisfaction, and furthermore received complaints and criticism, regarding the liner notes and written information printed onto the packaging of the band's three previous albums. He decided to respond to this by putting out a fourth Led Zeppelin album that would be as entirely devoid of any written explanations as he could devise. It would have no title whatsoever, have no words printed anywhere on the external packaging, and as few words as he could possibly get away with on the paper album sleeve. He even went so far as to refrain from naming the band members themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Central to this strategy was the four symbols: He asked each member of the band to chose a simple hieroglyphic-like symbol to stand in for that band member's name. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The whole undertaking was an artistic statement, or the lack of a statement, if you like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the ensuing 45 years, various explanations have come to light, some reluctantly provided by the band members themselves in various interviews. &#xA;To address your points and questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each member of the band chose a symbol to represent himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is well-documented that Jimmy Page was a serious lifelong student of the works of spiritualist/occultist Aleister Crowley. Page would of course have also studied earlier occultists who influenced Crowley. If this is what you mean by &quot;religious sources&quot;, it is true. It is likely that this influenced Page's choice of a symbol for himself. I have not read that any other member of Led Zeppelin studied Aleister Crowley, so it's not likely that the other three members of the band chose their symbols based on that influence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is fair to say that the members of Led Zeppelin wanted a bit of mystery around these symbols, which is probably why they did not explain them at the time. They chose to use these symbols on the paper sleeve that holds the vinyl album only. Their use of these obscure symbols, and the lack of written words where they would be expected, seems to state that they want the music to speak for itself without comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to sell this record album in stores, there had to be some way of labeling it or cataloging it, so Atlantic Records affixed stickers to the exterior of the plastic shrink-wrap sealing the cardboard album package, providing a track listing, the record label logo and the stock number. Once the customer purchased the album, they would have to cut open the plastic shrink-wrap in order to unseal the album and open its gatefold to see the artwork on the inside. Most customers would discard the shrink-wrap, meaning that they would lose the stickers and be left with an album package that said absolutely nothing on the exterior or the interior. The only printed information was on the paper album sleeve; minimal notes with track listing and the names of recording studios on one side, and the lyrics to &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; on the other side. The names of the members of Led Zeppelin, as band members, are not mentioned anywhere; guest singer Sandy Denny is named (and given her own fifth symbol). The production credit is &quot;Produced by Jimmy Page; Executive Producer, Peter Grant&quot;. The artist who did the interior gatefold illustration, Barrington Colby, is named. These names were probably stated according to the expectations and dictates of copyright law; they are the only personal names of people given.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the back side of the paper album sleeve, there are the lyrics to the song &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Notably lacking is the customary printed copyright notice for the lyrics; the name of the person or persons who wrote the lyrics is absent also.

This was due to the chosen format, faster is better, it provided the best method for frequency response (spectrum). But, it used up the recording space at a blinding pace because micro-grove had not been introduced. In order to release an entire &quot;session&quot;, a collection of records were placed in sleeves that were either loose in a cardboard case, or hinged in a cardboard &quot;album&quot; (used for both methods of release). The term &quot;album&quot; is directly synonymous With usage of the same term when speaking of a &quot;photo album&quot; - meaning a book containing many photos. You would hardly call a single page with many pictures &quot;an album&quot;. With the steady improvements, single songs were added to that back side and what we take for granted in later years were a dozen songs released on a single vinyl micro-groove pressing - is a record. When a double or triple disc collection is released, it is then, technically &quot;an album&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, we have no problem with a single CD being &quot;a CD&quot; where a collectors multiple disc set is called &quot;a CD set&quot;, it is that comparison between &quot;a record&quot; and &quot;an album&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Important cultural reference for those of you who have picture discs and know the thrill of owning them.

Many bags are collectors items.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &quot;sack&quot; is an item found in a grocery, general or other merchant stores, made from burlap, sackcloth, paper or plastic and often reused a second time as a means to convey garbage to it's disposal point. It is expendable and often disposed of after it's primary use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it is of interest to note:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Barrels to Feedsacks&#xA;Initially farm and food products were shipped in barrels. Between 1840 and 1890 cotton sacks gradually replaced barrels as food containers. Many of the logos on the flour sacks were circular, a legacy from the time when these logos had to fit on the top of a barrel. 1 Women quickly discovered that these bags could be used as fabric for quilts and other needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cotton had been king until the period of 1914 to 1929 when the price dropped out of the cotton market partially because synthetic fabrics like rayon became popular for dresses and undergarments. With the drop in the price of cotton even more companies began using cotton sacking as packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to Get Rid of Those Durn Labels&#xA;feed sack label&#xA;Initially these bags were plain unbleached cotton with product brands printed on them. In order for women to use these bags they first had to remove the label. Housewives used such methods as soaking the brand in kerosene or rubbing it with unsalted lard then washing it with lye soap. Later Fels-Naptha soap and Chlorine bleach were used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In spite of their efforts the entire brand label didn’t always get removed and sometimes it didn't seem worth the bother especially for making undergarments. As a result there are some amusing stories regarding feedsack underwear. “One young girl was out walking with her beau when she tripped and fell. Oh, how embarrassed she was when her betrothed noticed her underdrawers imprinted with 'southern best'! Another story was about a woman who made her husband's drawers from a flour sack and left the words 'self rising' on the cloth.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers Finally See a Promotion Opportunity&#xA;feedsack border print It took a while for feed and flour sack manufacturers to realize how popular these sacks had become with women. Eventually they saw a great opportunity for promoting the use of feedsacks. First feed sacks began to be sold in colors then around 1925 colorful prints for making dresses, aprons, shirts and children’s clothing began to appear in stores. Manufacturers began to paste on paper labels making it far easier to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the late 1930s there was heated competition to produce the most attractive and desirable prints. Artists were hired to design these prints. This turned out to be a great marketing ploy as women picked out flour, sugar, beans, rice, cornmeal and even the feed and fertilizer for the family farm based on which fabrics they desired. Some sacks displayed lovely border prints for pillowcases like the above print. Scenic prints like the one below were also popular. Manufacturers even made pre-printed patterns for dolls, stuffed animals, appliqué and quilt blocks. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taken from: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenfolk.com/quilting_history/feedsacks.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.womenfolk.com/quilting_history/feedsacks.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2062" LastActivityDate="2016-03-20T09:50:41.823" CommentCount="0" />

This era was in it's prime from about the year 1900-1920. Today most of these songs are too archaic to be considered current standards, but they laid the groundwork for later composition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Show Tunes and popular hits&lt;/strong&gt;: Many great jazz composers got their start in composing popular music, especially in the high-stress music mills known as Tin Pan Alley in New York City. This region had been around for decades, but especially during 1920-1940 these small studios would crank out music for use in Broadway plays and elsewhere. From there they were scouted out by movie studios in Hollywood to create theme songs for films. Later, jazz players would borrow these songs for the basis of improvisations (a respected tradition in jazz).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Classical music influences&lt;/strong&gt;: Jazz harmony, also known as &quot;extended harmonies,&quot; were drawn from the innovations of the European &quot;impressionist&quot; composers (like Debussy). Iconic chord progressions were co-opted from the classics, like that from &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; (Harpsichord Suite in G minor HMW 432, 4th movement). Pianist and bandleader Duke Ellington studied classical piano from an early age, learning all the classics and the &quot;romantic&quot; composers (i.e. Beethoven and Chopin). Both Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker were known to practice melody lines from classical opera arias. These talented players, composers and improvisers were very much aware of music theory and classics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;The Latin-American influence&lt;/strong&gt;: Since the boom Brazilian jazz in the 1950s, the styles of &quot;bossa nova&quot; and &quot;samba&quot; have been embraced in jazz standards. Also other afro-cuban styles and rhythms are commonly used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put all this together and you have the influences of The Great American Songbook (it's not actually a book, BTW, it's a concept).

He has more than 40 Japanese and Chinese films to his credit and is perhaps best known in the West[citation needed] for &quot;Yumeji's Theme&quot; (originally from Seijun Suzuki's Yumeji), included in director Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love (2000). Umebayashi scored most of Wong Kar-wai's follow-up film, 2046 (2004), and House of Flying Daggers. He is also the composer for the music of the first Serbian spectacle, Charleston &amp;amp; Vendetta. Umebayashi received the special &quot;Tomislav Pinter Award&quot; at Avvantura Film Festival Zadar (Croatia) in 2013 during his stay as member of the official Jury.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1029" LastActivityDate="2016-03-30T16:59:11.563" CommentCount="0" />

Today the nations known as 'Celtic' have a living Celtic language spoken in some of that nation's territory (Wales, Scotland, Ireland , Brittany, Cornwall, Isle of Man) or a recent Celtic heritage but no surviving language (Galicia and other parts of the Iberian peninsula). Some places have their own variant Celtic heritage via emigration, for example Gaelic in Cape Breton or Welsh in Patagonia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Festivals such as Glasgow's &quot;Celtic Connections&quot; are a showcase for music derived from the Celtic traditions of various places.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The music has instruments in common - fiddle, harp, whistles, bagpipes, and many common experiences - exile, oppression and attachment to their (now distant) homeland.

So I must be missing something. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a 1970s era Classic Rock / Progressive Rock Song.&#xA;It starts with what seems like a wind noise, or kind of a dreamy state sound effect.&#xA;The lyrics I can remember include:&#xA;&quot;do you remember&quot;&#xA;&quot;you were standing there in my dream&quot; and this could have taken place &quot;last night&quot;&#xA;something something about a &quot;girl with brown hair&quot; which may have been &quot;blowing in the wind&quot;. &#xA;I can recall something about the song being set in Fall, but I cant remember exactly of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its not Brown Eyed Girl, Diamonds and Rust, Street of Dreams, Last Night by the Travelling Wilburys, With the Wind and the Rain in Your Hair, and others that pop up with those terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joseem has been helpful by suggesting some more musical points of information to add to my question. Keep in mind this was long ago, and my memory focuses on the words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The singer was a male, with a voice reminiscent of Paul Rogers from Bad Company or Van Morrison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as instrumentation, all I can recall is a haunting tone, perhaps a guitar or piano. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tempo was slow and the music never built up to a crescendo, like a long ballad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rhythm was even throughout, I got the sense of a mourning, lull, woeful song.The beginning of and end of the song was a &quot;swooshing&quot; sound like wind was blowing across a barren plain or a rocky coastline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I say it was a 70s classic or prog rock song, because it was on a classic rock station and this is the feeling I get when I remember the tone of the song. I realize it is hard to quantify a feeling, this song did not have any aggressive qualities that stood out, so it was not a heavy metal-esque, nor psychadelic, blues-rock, or acid-rock. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2155" LastEditorUserId="2155" LastEditDate="2016-04-15T19:02:49.873" LastActivityDate="2016-05-16T00:21:10.073" Title="What is the name of this Progressive Rock song I can only recall fragments of?"

  <row Id="3270" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="3258" CreationDate="2016-04-08T21:35:48.163" Score="6" Body="&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the emancipation of black Americans in the United States, leisure activities were being demanded by this overworked and disenfranchised sector of the country. &lt;strong&gt;Juke joints, speakeasies and creep joints (brothels)&lt;/strong&gt; specifically catering to the black community began to spring up in the Southeast to meet the demand unfulfilled by whites-only bars and taverns. These places became verdant ground for the evolution of black music. Ragtime, barrelhouse jazz, and slow drag dance, which was an early precursor to the popular contemporary &quot;bump and grind&quot; style of dancing, were all evolving with and along blues in these adult establishments. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A large sector of the black community were fiercely religious at the time, and criticized blues artists for &lt;strong&gt;subverting the gospel and spiritual tradition&lt;/strong&gt; in the name of this secular and self-indulgent lifestyle music. The criticism came from all sectors of the &quot;square&quot; community, including of course, the white establishment. No one, it seems, wanted to acknowledge or accept what was going on in the underworld of black life. Black music had already for a long time been associated with evil influence, one of the earliest published denunciations found is  from 1913, when &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; defended the fear surrounding ragtime music: &quot;..decent people in and out of the church are beginning to be alarmed at the crude and vulgar music and loose conduct accompanying it with dances defying all propriety.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The stories and anecdotes that came from this underground community only fueled the fire. For example, the blues singer Son House was convicted for &lt;strong&gt;murder&lt;/strong&gt;, allegedly shooting and killing a man that was shooting up a juke joint alongside his female partner. The legendary Lead Belly once escaped prison, murdered a family member, and &lt;strong&gt;stabbed a white man&lt;/strong&gt; during a knife fight. Robert Johnson's life was shrouded in mystery, with his claim to fame, besides his amazing music, being &lt;strong&gt;a supposed deal with the devil&lt;/strong&gt; he made in Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another integral part to this negative perception by the mainstream community was the &lt;strong&gt;drugs, sex and alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; that infused the blues lifestyle. In the 1800's the &lt;strong&gt;word &quot;blue&quot; was slang for drunk&lt;/strong&gt;, illuminating the tight link between this new style of music and the world of vice. The period between 1920 - 1933 saw the prohibition of alcohol in the United States. Black music suddenly found a lucrative niche, rubbing shoulders with the seediest sides of the country, while making money providing the entertainment in illegal joints. Blues artist have also traditionally written about drug use. For example &lt;strong&gt;Cocaine Habit Blues&lt;/strong&gt; by Memphis Jug Band, &lt;strong&gt;Dope Head Blues&lt;/strong&gt; by Victoria Spivey, &lt;strong&gt;Cocaine&lt;/strong&gt; by Dick Justice, etc. Many artists were comfortable writing and performing &lt;strong&gt;sexually explicit songs&lt;/strong&gt;, many of which were women, including Julia Lee, Dinah Washington, Harry Roy, Harlem Hamfats, Lucille Bogan, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I see blues as one of the turning points of alternative culture. The true desires and needs of people were finally being celebrated, instead of denigrated or denied. It may be considered the Devil's music, but it was also the the Real Man and Woman's Freedom Music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2161" LastEditorUserId="2161" LastEditDate="2016-04-08T22:32:19.310" LastActivityDate="2016-04-08T22:32:19.310" CommentCount="0" />

I think that synchronization occurs though cutting the footage of the film to make it match the music in length. You'll also notice that in most scenes, the music is not synchronized because there is nothing to synchronize it with, but a few scenes will stand out because there is something to synchronize music with, and the music has been synchronized.  For example, in &lt;em&gt;Gettysburg&lt;/em&gt;, the talking and panning scenes have general music that is not synchronized with anything. However, during the battles, particularly the Battle of Little Round Top, they clearly cut some footage to fit the soundtrack exactly. I think that particular scene was designed with the music in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other times, they might cut the music. I believe this is generally done when the track was not specifically designed for the theme. When only one event must by synchronized (like the scary sight and loud note), they might just change the start and end times of the track to synchronize it. If you listen to the music several minutes before the event, you might notice that it changes (a new track starts) at a somewhat odd time. For example, in &lt;em&gt;Gettysburg&lt;/em&gt;, the track for the Battle of Little Round Top starts in the middle of a sentence so that they could synchronize the shouting of &quot;Bayonets&quot; and the swell in the music. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2172" LastActivityDate="2016-04-13T19:05:07.487" CommentCount="0" />

I imagine there's got to be at least a sentence or 2 about it in a correspondence between him and Berlioz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, this isn't really a &lt;em&gt;practically&lt;/em&gt; useful question, but as a classical saxophonist, I can't help but wonder about stuff like this :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: It's worth pointing out that Berlioz wrote saxophone into his 1844 arrangement of &lt;em&gt;Chant Sacre&lt;/em&gt;, so if Chopin went to the premier concert (conducted by Berlioz), that would be the same as knowing that he heard saxophone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just to be 100% clear, I know that Chopin certainly never considered writing for the saxophone, as his interest was (very) firmly in solo piano rep.  I'm just wondering if he ever heard a saxophone being played and, even better, if he ever mentioned it in writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2196" OwnerDisplayName="johnny_boy" LastEditorUserId="2196" LastEditDate="2016-04-16T04:56:32.130" LastActivityDate="2016-04-16T04:56:32.130" Title="What did Chopin think of the saxophone?"

As is known, other than pure piano pieces, he only wrote the cello pieces and songs in his very early youth and the two concertos. And the concertos he only wrote because some kind of portentous orchestral work was almost a requirement to be recognized as a serious composer, not that he was keen on doing orchestral works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it's unlikely than new instruments would raise more than the occasional curiosity in him, if that at all. His health condition, like pointed out by Carl above, is all the more reason why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, does not prove that he was not aware of the saxophone and did not express some opinion on it.

If you don't know at all where to start, ask for recommendations from your friends and family, look in youtube for the soundtrack of a film you like, or just tune a radio station (maybe that's not too fashionable, but it's still a good way to get to know new music and if you don't have an FM tuner, you can still listen to an Internet &quot;radio&quot; station on line). Any starting point is as good as another, a having few different ones is preferable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do this for a while, say every day or a few days a week, for 1 or 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will be a pleasant experience for you and raise your interest. After a while you'll be looking for mores pieces that are similar to the ones you enjoyed the most (Pandora is very good for that, as once you tell it a song that you like, it will look for and play you similar songs). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't work, that's totally ok. This approach may not suit you, or if music is just not for you, the world is full of interesting things, so that's not a drama in itself. There may be other approaches than the one I'm suggesting, of course, that I hope someone will put forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2203" LastEditorUserId="2203" LastEditDate="2016-04-20T19:45:43.470" LastActivityDate="2016-04-20T19:45:43.470" CommentCount="5" />

Streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora are generally considered to not pay artists at an adequate level, but they ARE legal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much any modern phone stores and plays back music. Most sites, such as Amazon, publish music in the mp3 format, which can be played on pretty much any device (usually with an app that comes with the device, but alternatively with any one of innumerable free and pay apps that play mp3s).  iTunes music is delivered in a different format (MP4), which can be played natively on many, but not all devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="92" LastEditorUserId="92" LastEditDate="2016-04-22T13:28:42.910" LastActivityDate="2016-04-22T13:28:42.910" CommentCount="3" />

Having said this, most of the time a song's meaning is subject to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To start with, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;linoleum&lt;/a&gt; is a type of floor covering. The whole song is playing around with this floor theme. It starts with the first few sentences:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Possessions never meant anything to me&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  I'm not crazy&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  Well that's not true, I've got a bed, and a guitar&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  And a dog named Bob who pisses on my floor&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  That's right, I've got a floor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last two lines have the following analyzis on genius:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is a humorous line, mocking a response that would be given to someone who might criticize the protagonist for being a hypocrite or “not punk”, since technically a floor is a possession.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not much more to add here. The singer has adapted to a punk lifestyle, where possesions are not deemed important, still he, like anyone with a home, owns a floor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the next few lines:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've got pockets full of kleenex and lint and holes&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  Where everything important to me&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  Just seems to fall right down my leg&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  And on to the floor&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The genius interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Being a punk means keeping everything you need right in your pockets. Since you don’t have much cash, your pants are old and tattered, with holes in the pockets. Everything the protagonist places into his pockets ends up back on the friendly linoleum; i.e. it is there to catch things that are important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a quite humoruos way, the singer suggests that the floor offers him stability, by &quot;collecting&quot; things he drop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the last lines before the floor themed is dropped:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;My closest friend linoleum&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  Linoleum&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  Supports my head, gives me something to believe&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the analyzis:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This illustrates why linoleum tile is the protagonist’s best friend: it catches change and other contents of his pocket, it supports his head when he passed out on the floor stinking drunk or high, doesn’t pass judgement, and delivers hope since it’s so solid and reliable. This word play implies that the protagonist is on the floor passed out a lot from partying, hence why he’s good friends with linoleum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what, he can always count on his linoleum floor. &lt;em&gt;&quot;Supports my head&quot;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that the singer is lying on the floor, probably from being drunk. The linoleum floor is there to support unconditionally, unlike human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After this, the lyrics move away from the floor theme, but keeps the theme of the punk lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to summarize:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me, the song is partly making fun of the punk lifestyle, while the singer admits living that way. The linoleum part is used to give a humorous twist to the fact that, despite the fact that possesions are not important, even most punks have somewhere to live. The floor also acts as his best friend and offers him support, whatever happens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The song is not only humorous in it's tone, it also has elements of social criticism, espacially in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1029" LastActivityDate="2016-04-27T16:24:49.790" CommentCount="0" />

Like any good art, music should make you think or feel what the creator of the art wants you to think or feel.  It is a way to share thought or emotion.  Blues when you're sad, Disco and R&amp;amp;B when you want to dance, Pop when you want to feel good, and Metal when you want to break stuff.  :o)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Metal, first and foremost, is about aggression.  Much the same way Punk is an attitude, so, too, is Metal.  We all have a dark side, and Metal calls to that.  So, it's only logical that most Metal songs are about violence and destruction.  However, some of them are just about being a teenager, which was the target market back when Metal started breaking through.  Take &quot;Heading Out To The Highway&quot; by Judas Priest for example.  Not a violent song, more of a song of rebellion.  &quot;Livin' After Midnight&quot;; same thing.  &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; by Sabbath?  Not even close to violent.

Consider: early jazz band relied on tubas and banjos because neither a string bass nor a guitar could be heard on acoustical recordings.

As amplification technology improved, pianists like Teddy Wilson replaced the likes of Earl Hines and singers like Billie Holiday replaced the likes of Kate Smith.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Movie composers live in the world, and certainly they would be as interested in and influenced by evolving technology as anyone else in music or anyone else in movies. But mainly, the technological developments that are most exploited these days have less to do with recording technology and more to do with sound production. In other words, the question is less &quot;How do we record a string section that will sound good for this scene?&quot; and more &quot;How do we produce a sound like that of a string section?&quot; A single soundtrack may include a symphony orchestra playing Beethoven, a didgeridoo, a cool jazz quintet, an African drum ensemble, and any number of purely electronic sounds all created within the same studio on the same synthesizer by one person.

No 12 bar form and no blues harmonic structure (hip hop harmonic structure is usually fairly flat and static). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the more primitive forms of blues where also rather static harmonically, for example when performed with the single string instrument the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diddley_bow.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;diddley bow&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2GlAA5iiG8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;). Also, one of the more direct musical influences of hip hop is the &quot;turntablism&quot; of Jamaican origin, that in turn arised from reggae (or at least from the reggae culture), that also had some blues influences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding lyrics, usually you don't find  in hip hop the AAB standard blues form.

In Zurich, Wagner told friends about his dream of building a revolutionary theatre, staging his Ring cycle in a model performance, and then burning the theater after one performance. That in a nutshell was his dream: create the perfect theater world and then destroy it. Burt after building such a revolutionary new theater for a revolutionary opera, why burn down the theater?

One would think his purpose would be to left a durable legacy, not to destroy it. However, the contradictory personality portrayed here may be a possible explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another curiously related episode reported by Wagner himself in his autobiography happened during the 1849 Dresden uprising. Amidst the military manouvers,...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Wagner climbed up [...] the Kreuzkirche tower as an observer [...] and spent a night on its top. As morning came, the composer [...] saw the old opera house, where a month earlier he had conducted Beethoven, in flames. [...] The burning opera house convinced Wagner that &quot;strategic purposes&quot; would &quot;always predominate in the world over aesthetic consideration.&quot; (It was an ugly building anyway, he remarked).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Thomas S.

Wagner complained that the stage of the &quot;new&quot; theater [of which Semper had been architect] was insufficintly deep for his requirements; whereupon Semper, half-angrily, hald-humourosly, replied,&quot;Ah well, I'd like to burn the place down myself!&quot; The conversation was overheard [...] and after that, of course, it only needed the conflagration at the &quot;old&quot; opera house for the crime to be fixed on Wagner and Semper!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Ernest Newman, &lt;em&gt;The Life of Richard Wagner&lt;/em&gt;, page 78)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the idea of destruction by fire to allow renovation is one that could have been in Wagner's mind for many years, at least metaphorically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2203" LastActivityDate="2016-05-11T16:48:24.767" CommentCount="1" />

The&#xA;  Vltava swirls into the St John's Rapids; then it widens and flows&#xA;  toward Prague, past the Vyšehrad, and then majestically vanishes into&#xA;  the distance, ending at the Labe (or Elbe, in German).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These words or a version of them are often used in program notes or as a verbal introduction to the piece. The text may also be mocking other program notes which try to make (too) specific associations between the music and some external object,place or person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a more practical basis, a tone poem usually takes some theme outside of music - a fictional character, a place etc. The River Vltava is a major river, seen as the national river of Czechoslovakia, so fits with a nationalistic theme. The River Oder is much longer and runs through Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Germany. It may have associations suitable for a tone poem, but less likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="65" LastActivityDate="2016-05-13T18:05:36.000" CommentCount="1" />

In this case, there is clear allusion that they are referencing the drug cocaine, which has been called &quot;Mother of Pearl&quot;, especially in the 70s. The lyrics seem to transition from or between the idea of a romantic lover and the drug throughout the song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, the meaning is most likely both &quot;cocaine&quot; and &quot;an amazing lady&quot; in this song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mother of Pearl&quot; has a few meaning in English&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a material sometimes used in jewelry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a slang for cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an exclamation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mother of pearl!

Unless the manufacturer designed the turntable with specific components for different world markets, this is quite likely to be feasible. Some have a variable resistor in or near the motor. DJ turntables have these on the outside, easily-accessible. Domestic turntables may not be in such easy reach.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check the speed quite simply by printing out a downloadable strobe disc, available from many sites. This is one example - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vinylengine.com/strobe-discs.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.vinylengine.com/strobe-discs.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a frequency converter to take your power supply from 60Hz down to 50Hz.

Classical composers have always been inspired by popular music and incorporated popular melodies in their compositions. In the beginning of the XX century many European (particularly French) classical composers where interested and influenced by the new Jazz music coming from America. Some jazz currents have drunk heavily from the theoretical bases of classical music. Rock has been influenced by Jazz and vice-versa. Rock has been influenced by classical music (a lot, and not just progressive or symphonic rock). Both Jazz and rock have been influenced by different types of (the so called) &quot;world&quot; music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Individual artists may search along these common paths or have their specific, some times idiosyncratic interests and sources of inspiration. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These cross influences may manifest themselves in a more or less obvious application of tools, techniques and aesthetical values. Take as an example the usage of the sitar and indian music influence in some songs of the Beatles and solo work of George Harrison. I don't mean that such work is not creative and original, but the presence of a &quot;foreign&quot; influence is rather evident.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or the influence may be less obvious and more indirect. Again an example from the Beatles, according to Donovan, Paul McCartney wrote Blackbird while trying to learn some traditional folk fingerpicking.

This is perhaps less of a factor now, as there has been (I believe) a slower pace of change in musical tastes over the last couple of decades, but a successful musician in the mid 80s would have been unlikely to be commercially viable producing the same music he perhaps grew up with in the early 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, these days, musical tastes tend to be broader in general than in the past; people aren't stuck getting their music knowledge from one magazine or radio station as might have been the case some years ago; It's getting rarer to meet &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; who is only into a single style of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musicians often consciously ignore genres, seeing all music as 'just music' with no boundaries; having a level of musical knowledge often makes it easier to relate elements in one genre to aspects of another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the above is true, you might ask why musicians often do produce a number of songs (or albums) in a similar style; I would guess that it's sometimes more to do with the realities of presenting a predictable product to a well-defined market sector than a desire to keep producing the same music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16" LastActivityDate="2016-05-26T22:56:31.017" CommentCount="4" />

There may be restrictions to what they can call the colours. For example Rickenbacker use the 'glo' suffix with a lot of their colours (think Fireglo, Mapleglo, Jetglo). Whilst fans and collectors tend to add the 'glo' suffix colloquially to other Rickenbacker finishes, notably 'Burgundyglo' or the subtly dysphemismistic 'Glueglo' (used to describe some rare Rickenbacker models with glue bleeding from the binding into the surrounding wood), I don't think another manufacturer could use 'glo' without facing some litigation from Rickenbacker themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Ibanez NDM3 looks like a homage to Gibson's TV Yellow, of sorts. TV Yellow itself is, rather than a solid colour finish, the result of a bewildering multi-step finishing process involving tinted grain fillers and clear coats. There is a lot of variation in Gibson's TV Yellow, even throughout the period in the '50s in which it was originally used. Therefore I don't see Gibson standardising it to a single hue and then chasing other manufacturers for their visual approximations. Beyond that I cannot think of another manufacturer who could lay claim to that shade of yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Noodles model is a re-hashed Talman model, and from memory they used to come with some sort of gaffa tape finish. This yellow finish was probably just for a short run, perhaps because the paint was specially commissioned by Ibanez.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Less esoterically, some manufacturers stick to the 'classic' finishes because they know they sell.

If you watch the Woodstock movie, for example, you will see more Gibson guitars of all marques, and Fender basses in the main. In the '60s the Strat was almost entirely synonymous with surf rock and instrumental music, and couldn't reliably drive the front end of a tube amp in the same way that Gibson instruments could, which was the sound that a lot of guitarists were chasing in the latter half of the '60s. Hendrix is the exception, of course, but there is an almost super-human element to how he chased such a rich, thick tone from a Strat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mention some guitarists, but they probably all have different reasons for adopting the Strat, ultimately. Stevie Ray Vaughn didn't really surface until the '80s, so should probably be excluded from the list. Jimi Hendrix started using them when he moved to London in 1966, perhaps because in part he found the whammy bar to be a useful and expressive tool. It might just be the first guitar that he was given when he arrived, and quickly he became iconic for playing them reversed? He used Strats for stage work, but is photographed using many other instruments in the studio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Beck used a Strat with the Jeff Beck group in the late '60s, but made far greater use of a couple of Les Pauls during the period. He used a Strat more from the mid-'70s onwards as it complimented his playing style more as he stopped using a pick and used the whammy as an expressive tool as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eric Clapton possibly used one as a direct influence of Robbie Robertson of The Band. He was also moving away from Gibsons, which he used exclusively during the Cream era (with the exception of a Fender XII on 'Dance the Night Away'). Clapton took press reviews of his Cream period badly, with some claiming he was little more than taking a 'copy and paste' approach to earlier blues guitarist's licks and riffs. Perhaps for him the thinner, wirier Fender tone was a clear distinction from the meaty Gibson roar he had become synonymous with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking the Strat is ergonomic and quite comfortable to play for long periods, as long as you get on with the neck. Of the most popular guitars of the '60s, the Strat is more ergonomic than a Telecaster, lighter than a Les Paul and balanced more towards the body than the notoriously neck-heavy Gibson SG. Strats are also harder wearing. Watch the Rolling Stones' Gimmie Shelter film and you will see Gibsons haphazardly stacked against and resting on top of amps. Touring guitarists perhaps didn't baby their instruments so much back then, so Gibson headstocks got broken quite frequently. Stratocasters are modular, so broken parts can be quickly unbolted and replaced. Hendrix favoured some Strats and carried a cache of mostly sunburst, rosewood necked 'beater' Strats he would close a set with. There are photos and video evidence that suggests he typically threw the Strats into his amps to round off a concert, which would quickly break a Gibson.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1889" LastActivityDate="2016-06-03T10:05:22.067" CommentCount="0" />
