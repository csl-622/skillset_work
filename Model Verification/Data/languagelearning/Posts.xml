In fact, Esperanto, being by far the most popular constructed language, does have native speakers. People with different first languages who have met through the Esperanto community have bought up children with Esperanto as their first language. In fact, I believe that there are now some second-generation speakers.

I imagine you’re asking about learning Esperanto as a stepping-stone to learning another language. Some experts do indeed recommend this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theory is that Esperanto, being a constructed regular language, is fairly easy to learn, and that learning &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; language makes it easier for you to learn another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first part of that is undeniably true: Esperanto &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; easy to learn (at least, compared to most other languages). The second does have some supporting evidence, but it is tentative. The idea of learning Esperanto first has been around for a while, but what probably jumped it into the public consciousness was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gSAkUOElsg&quot;&gt;Tim Morley’s talk at TEDxGranta&lt;/a&gt;, who described using Esperanto in British primary schools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And it &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there are some considerations which may not apply to an adult learner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One of the problems was a lack of teachers qualified to teach French directly. It’s easier to &lt;em&gt;train teachers&lt;/em&gt; to teach Esperanto. This probably won’t apply in your case.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This was, specifically, the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; foreign language learned by these children. If you’ve already learned a second language and are now tackling a third, most of the considerations won’t apply.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learning in a classroom situation, having your peers fairly fluent is an aid to learning and confidence. Therefore, a language which is quick and easy to learn will build confidence.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can jump to the “creative” stuff quicker, which builds confidence, interest, and joy.

Using the generic ge (个) for classifying nouns is what most Chinese (Taiwanese in my case) people recommend when beginning. This can be used for just about everything. As you start to learn what each classifier implies (本 for bound books, magazines, &amp;c; 张 for flat things like paper, newspaper, &amp;amp;c.; 封 for letters and things within envelopes), you can add more classifiers to your common use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that said, when learning basic nouns and noun categories, it is useful to learn the most common classifiers when learning nouns. However, many native speakers themselves may ignore the &quot;correct&quot; classifier to use the generic classifier if convenience serves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classifiers are sometimes compared to grammatical gender of other languages (though they are not the same) because of the &lt;em&gt;classification&lt;/em&gt; given to a class of nouns. However, they are distinct from gender because some nouns may fall into multiple classes whereas grammatical gender is an essential (and virtually unchanging) aspect of the noun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One benefit of learning the classifiers commonly associated with a noun group is that you do not need to go back to relearn them or learn additional ones. However, this is only a slight advantage as many classifier-using languages have intricacies in the usage of different classifiers and even native speakers may disagree on the &quot;proper&quot; usage.

On the other hand, for some people, they are simply dreary, boring and can be utterly discouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grammar exercises are the linguistic equivalent of math drills. Sure, an elementary school student might understand how multiplication works, but solving problem after problem after problem helps him internalize this knowledge so that when he's an adult buying 6 apples, $0.50 each, he doesn't need to think long and hard to know that he'll need to pay $3 at the register. It's the same with grammar exercises: solving problems helps you review and internalize grammatical structures so that you'll be able to automatically use correct language later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that grammar drills let you practice structures that may not appear quite as frequently in authentic language. For instance: the French passé simple is a literary tense that is fairly rare nowadays, so you won't come across it too often. To get the same exposure to the passé simple in authentic language as you would working through a single unit in a grammar book, you would probably need to write quite a few texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many exercise types let you focus only on the grammar, and ignore the other things (for instance, vocabulary choice). Again, this is helpful - especially if you are learning a new grammatical structure, or know about your weaknesses / problem areas and want to work on those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the clear-cut quality of grammar exercises, they're also much easier to check on your own, without the help of a teacher or native speaker. This means you can fix much of your grammar on your own, leaving your teacher to help you with the more difficult, somewhat more subjective things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamming a bunch of examples next to each other is helpful (although this might only work for some types of language learners) in that it lets you compare the different uses, note exceptions, and find patterns of your own that make sense to you personally. It's hard to find patterns across 20 pages, but much easier if you have 20 sentences listed on one page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing plenty of grammar exercises also lets you identify problem areas within topics you might think you are already proficient with. For instance, English articles (a/an/the/-) are very difficult for Poles (as Polish has no articles), but there comes a time (fairly late in the game, admittedly) when a Polish learner of English thinks he has mastered the article. Working through a set of exercises will help identify specific instances of misuse within a topic that is, overall, generally no longer problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that being said - grammar exercises are not the be all and end all. One only truly knows a language if they can use all of its aspects (vocabulary, grammar, pronounce, spelling, idioms, etc) together. Grammar is just one of several building blocks, and grammar exercises simply help you make sure that that block is as solid as it can be before you build the rest of your structure on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="93" LastActivityDate="2016-04-05T21:14:08.287" CommentCount="0" />

Language learning can be a difficult process and it doesn't come as easily to some people.

Communication apprehension is commonly caused by a deficiency in a specific part of a language. Test anxiety is more specific to students learning a language in a class room. Learning a language is a complex task, and being tested on it can be a daunting feeling for some. Additionally the fear of negative evaluation is also commonly caused in a class room, where a student is anxious due to feeling incompetent. Most causes of anxiety are due to a lack of confidence, or self-esteem. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_language_anxiety&quot;&gt;[source]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rapidintellect.com/AEQweb/t5396v4.pdf&quot;&gt;[yet another source]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Cultural Discrepancies&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; This one applies more to children rather than adults.

They also match pictures to words and list common words at a slower pace. Most of the disadvantages fall under the category of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilingual_lexical_access&quot;&gt;lexical access&lt;/a&gt;. In my own experience, I started taking a while to recall some advanced English words around the time I started learning extra languages. I quote the paper's summary of the topic here: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Research with adult bilinguals built on these studies with children and reported two major trends. First, a large body of evidence now demonstrates that the verbal skills of bilinguals in each language are generally weaker than are those for monolingual speakers of each language. Considering simply receptive vocabulary size, bilingual children [23] and adults [24] control a smaller vocabulary in the language of the community than do their monolingual counterparts. On picture-naming tasks, bilingual participants are slower [25–28] and less accurate [29, 30] than monolinguals. Slower responses for bilinguals are also found for both comprehending [31] and producing words [32], even when bilinguals respond in their first and dominant language. Finally, verbal fluency tasks are a common neuropsychological measure of brain functioning in which participants are asked to generate as many words as they can in 60 seconds that conform to a phonological or semantic cue. Performance on these tasks reveals systematic deficits for bilingual participants, particularly in semantic fluency conditions [33–37], even if responses can be provided in either language [38]. Thus, the simple act of retrieving a common word is more effortful for bilinguals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The studies referenced are these:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;23&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Bialystok E, et al.

According to Marina Nespor, Italian linguist and author of the book &quot;Fonologia,&quot; it is &quot;that branch of grammar that is occupied with the sounds that are systematically used in natural languages for communicating meanings.&quot; Put more simply, phonology studies the meanings of the sounds we make when we speak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[4.2] One important fact to begin with, is the difference between phonology (fonologia) and phonetics (fonetica). Phonetics analyzes all sounds arising from human speech, regardless of the language or meaning. Phonology studies the sounds in context, searching for patterns by determining which sounds contain meaning, then explaining how these sounds are understood by a native speaker. So while phonetics studies how the letter &quot;f&quot; is produced (what parts of the mouth are used and how, in order to say an &quot;f&quot;) and how it is perceived, phonology analyzes how the words fa and va have different meanings, despite only differing by one sound.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="90" LastEditorUserId="90" LastEditDate="2016-04-25T18:19:54.573" LastActivityDate="2016-04-25T18:19:54.573" CommentCount="1" />

You depend on the language to survive—to buy groceries, to talk to employers and customers, to ask for directions, etc.  Being forced to use the language means you learn it even when you're not actively trying to.  It becomes a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You learn the language in more than one way.&lt;/strong&gt;  Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don't know a word, you simply can't communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you're trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own.  This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You begin to think in the language.&lt;/strong&gt;  If you use the language enough you'll start to get good enough at it that you won't have time to think in your native language and translate.  Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs you read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say &quot;excuse me&quot; or ask for help.  Because you can't afford long delays, you'll begin to skip the translation step.  This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture reinforces language learning.&lt;/strong&gt;  When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language.

For our example, the first line of the chorus from “Do-Re-Mi” fits perfectly: “Doe a deer, a female deer…”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now swap the target phrase in place of the original lyrics, maintaining the melody.&lt;/strong&gt; So this time, you sing “Un mo-men-to por fa-vor” to the tune of “Do-Re-Mi.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeat as often as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; This last step is another important one. You’ll find that it can sound a bit awkward at first. Don’t be discouraged and stick with it. Keep on singing until it stops being awkward.

Mandarin Chinese could also be very easy for someone else with another language.

Usually, though, I stick right to that 15-word range and enjoy steady long-term results. One of the most important things to keep in mind is that you rarely learn a vocabulary word the first time you see it, or even the first day you see it. You have to review a word again, and again, and again.

It won’t be very fast progress, but it will be consistent and continuous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both sources refer to learning Spanish, so really about 15 words a day, with 30 minute or more practice sessions. The first source suggests that learning less than 15 words daily could be too slow, while learning more than 50 words a day could cause you to not remember the words. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it's also a safe bet to say that this works for any other language other than Spanish. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="91" LastActivityDate="2016-04-06T21:33:58.217" CommentCount="0" />

Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The usual tip when learning a language with (mostly) arbitrary grammatical gender like French or German is to &lt;strong&gt;always learn the article with the noun&lt;/strong&gt;. When you learn the word for &lt;em&gt;car&lt;/em&gt;, learn “la voiture” or “une voiture”. I think I the definite article is taught more often, but it has a downside of hiding the gender if the word starts with a vowel sound: better learn “un arbre” than “l'arbre”. Make sure you understand the pronunciation of the indefinite article though: “une arme” and “un arbre” only differ by the vowel sound (and the noun itself), since the E in &lt;em&gt;une&lt;/em&gt; is silent and the N in &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt; is sounded due to the &lt;em&gt;liaison&lt;/em&gt; with the following vowel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nouns that specifically designate male people (or animals) are masculine. Ditto for females and feminine nouns. (There are a few exceptions with professions that are traditionally gendered.) These nouns usually come in pairs, e.g. “père/mère” (father/mother), “acteur/actrice” (actor/actress), “chat/chatte” (male/female cat). With such pairs, apart from a few common words, the male and female forms differ only by a suffix, the female suffix always ends with &lt;code&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt;, and the suffixes mostly follow the same patterns as for adjectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, you can't rely on the meaning of the word. Even if two nouns are synonyms, that doesn't make it more likely that they have the same gender.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;sometimes&lt;/strong&gt; rely on the &lt;strong&gt;ending&lt;/strong&gt; of the word. &lt;a href=&quot;http://french.stackexchange.com/questions/2616/is-there-any-general-rule-to-determine-the-gender-of-a-noun-based-on-its-spellin/16781#16781&quot;&gt;Many word endings are strongly gendered&lt;/a&gt;. You may want to learn the most common ones, but I'm not convinced of the effectiveness of this approach: that's one more arbitrary classification to learn, and most classes have exceptions that you'd need to learn anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think (but I have no data or personal experience to support it) that it would be more effective to learn nouns on an individual basis. Once you know a critical mass of nouns, you can start looking for patterns: if you're unsure about the gender of a noun, try to think of a few words with the same ending; if they all have the same gender then chances are that the noun you're wondering about has the same gender.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What works better than endings is &lt;strong&gt;suffixes&lt;/strong&gt;. Many suffixes have a single gender. If a word is built from a stem and a suffix, then once you recognize the suffix, you know the gender of the noun. For example, &lt;em&gt;-tion&lt;/em&gt; is exclusively a feminine suffix, so any word built with that suffix is feminine, e.g. you don't need to learn words like &lt;em&gt;vasoconstriction&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mobilisation&lt;/em&gt; to know their gender. But there are a couple of words that just happen to end with those letters (e.g. &lt;em&gt;cation&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;em&gt;ca-&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;-tion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gestion&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;em&gt;ges-&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;-tion&lt;/em&gt;), and they can be of either gender. (In this case, recognizing the suffix also tells you the pronunciation of the word: the suffix &lt;em&gt;-tion&lt;/em&gt; is pronounced [sjɔ̃], but the letters “tion” are otherwise pronounced [tjɔ̃].)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="105" LastActivityDate="2016-04-06T22:13:57.603" CommentCount="0" />

This is a subset of conversing with a native speaker as they are trying to help you in your acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When conversing with an L1 speaker, much of the responsibility for proper communication and learning relies on the L2 speaker. There are many proposed frameworks for this, but none have been accepted as &lt;em&gt;&quot;the answer&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Though not &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; a language learning concept, self-confidence is crucial to pursuing language acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One theme found in many frameworks (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=GE7JAwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PP1&amp;amp;dq=second+language+learning+circumlocution&amp;amp;ots=-FUpuJwUuo&amp;amp;sig=XJRt_t4nccmpmyTbWRAI9sxsk5g#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=second%20language%20learning%20circumlocution&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategies in Learning and Using a Second Language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is the concept of self-awareness in language use. Other important themes related to this are active corrective listening, the use of circumlocution, speech mimicking, mirroring, and summarization, grouping, deduction, imagery, elaboration, inference, recombination, and translation. (A more complete list can be found in &lt;em&gt;Strategies&lt;/em&gt;, p. 76.) I will only discuss a few of these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Corrective Listening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When unsure of how to say a particular phrase, rather than not speak at all, speak as best as you can generate the sentence, and then listen to the L1 speaker. Often, native speakers will repeat back part of the sentence with the corrected grammar as a way to ensure that they understood what was communicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, in Chinese, if you wanted to asked if someone wanted to go with you to the movies, you would say (this is a gloss) &quot;You want not-want with me go watch movies?&quot; English speakers would place the &quot;with me&quot; part of the sentence at the end if asking this in English. However this is incorrect in Chinese. So, if the L2 speaker asked (incorrectly) &quot;You want not-want go watch movies with me?&quot;, the L1 speaker would commonly respond with something like, &quot;Yes, I want with you go watch movies.&quot; which uses the proper way to incorporate &quot;with (somebody)&quot; into the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Observing the corrections that the native speaker inserts into his/her responses and &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; incorporating them into your speech (ie. responding with something like, &quot;Great! I'm happy you want with me go watch movies!&quot;) reinforces the proper usage and improves comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When communicating with a native speaker, occasionally summarizing the conversation provides feedback to check understanding. If the summary proves to be incorrect or incomplete, it gives the native speaker an opportunity to jump in and clarify something that may be unclear or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circumlocution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also known as lexical substitution. When you do not know a word or phrase or are unsure of a word usage, you can &quot;talk around&quot; the word or phrase and allow the native speaker to provide the word you are looking for, or to verify your word usage. Even among native speakers, this is what most people do when the word or phrase is on &quot;the tip of their tongue&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; to start conversing with a native speaker is not as important as &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to start conversing with a native speaker.

The&#xA;  more common elements the closer they are. Mandarin and Cantonese are&#xA;  not mutually intelligible, but both have rich tonal systems, similar&#xA;  isolating grammars, and fairly simple phonological rules to map&#xA;  cognate words. Likewise French and Italian have a set of comparisons&#xA;  (similar conjugation/gender rules) and fairly regular rules mapping&#xA;  cognates. And the two sets of differences, those between&#xA;  Mandarin/Cantonese, and those between French/Spanish are of the same&#xA;  scale. The difference between French and German is so much larger than&#xA;  between Mandarin/Cantonese that one would be hard pressed to say they&#xA;  are of similar distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Quantitatively, one can define distance mathematically, by collecting&#xA;  a set of quantitative features in each language, and then defining a&#xA;  distance function that calculates an exact positive real number out of&#xA;  a combination of all the differences of these features. Then one can&#xA;  do a simple numerical comparison, the distance between X and Y and the&#xA;  distance between Z and W. One can go further and use a clustering&#xA;  algorithm to create a formal family tree of all languages of concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Presumably, the utility of a distance function would be to predict the&#xA;  difficulty in language learning or translation (machine or human); the&#xA;  further the distance, the more changes would need to be navigated. At&#xA;  some point, a distance will be meaningless; the difference between&#xA;  French and Swahili is just too much to settle qualitatively or quantitatively to then bother comparing with some other distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ftp.iza.org/dp1246.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this scientific report&lt;/a&gt; suggests that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The distance between two languages may also depend on whether it is in the&#xA;  written or spoken form. For example, the written form of Chinese does not vary among&#xA;  the regions of China, but the spoken languages differ sharply. Alternatively, two&#xA;  languages that may be close in the spoken form may differ more sharply in the written&#xA;  form (for example, if they use different alphabets, as in the case of German and Yiddish).&#xA;  Perhaps the way to address the distance between languages is not through&#xA;  language trees which trace the evolution of languages, but by asking a simpler question:&#xA;  How difficult is it for individuals who know language A to learn languages B1 through&#xA;  Bi, where there are i other languages. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If it is more difficult to learn language B1, than it is to learn&#xA;  language B2, it can be said that language B1 is more “distant” from A&#xA;  than language B2. Language B3 may be as difficult to learn as is&#xA;  language B1 for a language A speaker, but that does not mean that&#xA;  language B3 is close to language B1. Indeed, it may be further from B1&#xA;  than it is from A. Alternatively, if the issue is the adjustment of&#xA;  immigrants speaking languages B1 through Bi in the linguistic&#xA;  destination A, one would want to know how difficult it is for speakers&#xA;  of B1 through Bi to learn language A.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/09q619H&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/kIrmNOS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; of the table that shows the linguistic proximity between languages according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="91" LastActivityDate="2016-04-07T22:58:14.680" CommentCount="1" />

Some benefits are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are a few Hanja which are used by themselves quite frequently, often in public places, posters, newspapers, in graphic design, etc.  They're almost used the same way that symbols are used in other languages.  Examples are 大, 中, 小 (large, medium, small - used in menus, etc.), 男, 女 (male and female), 美, 英, 日 (used to represent America, UK and Japan in newspapers), etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A very large portion of Korean words are derived from Hanja, so knowing what they mean is very helpful for learning words (including ones that don't appear in the dictionary).  You don't actually need to learn what the Hanja look like, as long as you know the meanings associated with each Hangeul character; but often there are many Hanja associated with a single Hangeul syllable.  For example, 시 has dozens of Hanja, several of which are common: 時(time), 市(city), 施(do/act), 詩(poem), 始(start), 示(show), etc.  Knowing Hanja can help keep these different meanings straight. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also, Hanja are used to separate homonyms in the dictionary, so knowing them can help when using the dictionary too.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are interested in visual arts, learning how to draw the Hanja then how to paint the Hanja can be fun.

Spoken language arises in the mind but must be performed through complex sequences of breath control and voice shaping muscle movements. Furthermore, nobody speaks in such a way that every other person can comprehend them; for example, in loud dance hall environments, it becomes difficult to understand someone from the sound alone. But any sound is being produced by physical movement, so we can get a grasp on the goal utterance by observing earlier in the phonological chain, the observable movements themselves. Furthermore, it is understandable, through such experiments as reveal the McGurk effect, that the observation of the speech movements does indeed comprise a significant portion of the mechanism for speech understanding. A ballpark figure might be: 70% of speech understanding is audio, 15% from observation of the speech production, and the remainder from context and body language. These figures will of course vary from many various factors, relative to the mode of communication (telephone, face-to-face,  etc.), speaker, listener, environment, and topic of conversation. To observe the manner of pronunciation would thus lend itself to performing in a similar manner oneself. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="225" LastActivityDate="2016-04-08T11:23:36.213" CommentCount="0" />

(Yes, some may argue that the IPA is a list of distinctive sounds that occur in natural language, but there is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; section of diacritics that alter how those sounds are made.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an important concept in language (whether learning, using, creating, &amp;amp;.) that morphs our pronunciation. It is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarticulation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coarticulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There are two main kinds of coarticulation: &lt;em&gt;anticipatory&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;carryover/perseverative&lt;/em&gt;. This is something that we cannot escape from in language. The central concept behind coarticulation is that we cannot isolate individual sounds from their environments. We either prepare for the next sounds (&lt;em&gt;anticipatory&lt;/em&gt;) or characteristics of one sound are carried over to the next (&lt;em&gt;perseverative&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipatory Coarticulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sounds that precede another sound (usually a consonant) are affected by those following sounds (either in the same word or in the next word, known as liason). In this case, we prepare for the next sound by modifying the current sound. (One of my linguistics professors said this was the most common form of coarticulation, but I cannot remember the source he quoted.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example. In English, take the words &quot;high&quot; and &quot;hue&quot;. Notice the position of your mouth when saying &quot;high&quot;. The initial /h/ is open and unobstructed because it is preparing for the open unrounded /ai/ that is to follow. But when you say &quot;hue&quot;, your tongue comes up to the top of your mouth and prepares for the /j/ (y-sound) that comes after it. Which one of these &quot;h&quot;s is the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; &quot;h&quot;? They both are, but their pronunciation is affected by preparing for the subsequent sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though English has one of the richest vowel systems (and its vowels contain the vowels of most other languages), it does not have all of the consonants that would change how those vowels are pronounced (advanced tongue root, retracted tongue root, centralized, &amp;amp;c), nor does it have all the features of other languages that are &lt;em&gt;applied&lt;/em&gt; to vowels or consonants (like breathy voice, creaky voice, rhoticity [English actually has this one], nasalization, more/less rounding, &amp;amp;c.). This makes the topic of vowels and consonants very difficult across languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is ultimately wrong to only consider vowels and consonants as being &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;static&quot; because they change so much across cultures, regions, languages, and dialect. Fully embracing and learning to pronounce &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the &quot;vowels&quot; and &quot;consonants&quot; of a language will lead to you naturally utilizing coarticulation to morph the sound into the correct one. In Chinese, when I learned the palatalized and retroflexed consonants as well as the /y/ sound, I realized that I naturally started pronouncing the words better and the Taiwanese people noticed. So, learn the sounds independently, yes. But practice them together with other sounds and you will find it helps your overall pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6" LastActivityDate="2016-04-08T14:36:13.423" CommentCount="1" />

This is (probably) not what you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to re-do your flash cards, replacing all English-language definitions with Korean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this can pose its own challenges.  The first time you come across a new card, you may have no idea what it means.  To aide with this, include pictures.  If you're using electronic flash cards, find images on Google Images. If you're using paper cards, draw a diagram, or glue a photo from a magazine (old style cut-and-paste).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now this approach may have a slight down-side.  If you successfully make this change, you may find after a while that &lt;em&gt;you don't know how to translate any more&lt;/em&gt;.  I have this problem at times, since switching all of my flash cards to be 100% L2 (including the parts of speech, etc). But, for my purposes, this is a very small problem (as I'm rarely translating). And I think learning to translate probably should come after learning to speak (for most language learners).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13" LastActivityDate="2016-04-11T12:35:07.670" CommentCount="0" />

When you watch someone speak, you don't just hear the words that are spoken, you also see the facial expressions, body language, and accompanying hand gestures used in conjunction with their dialog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example from English of the importance of visual cues to deduct proper meaning:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When my oldest son [Linus Torvalds] was asked the same question: “Has he been approached by the NSA about backdoors?” he said “No”, but at the same time he nodded. Then he was sort of in the legal free. He had given the right answer, [but] everybody understood that the NSA had approached him. &lt;a href=&quot;http://falkvinge.net/2013/11/17/nsa-asked-linus-torvalds-to-install-backdoors-into-gnulinux/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;(Falvinge, 2013)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it is not just a free pass to say that movies will teach you another language. They have their disadvantages as well. Movies often use slang and slur their words when speaking or their sentences are not a uniform volume.

Movies are part of the cultural experience of the language you are trying to learn. When I talk about &quot;There's no place like home&quot;, you instantly know that I am referring to &lt;em&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt; and I can convey a lot more to you in that little phrase, than trying to explain a whole lot about not being grateful for what you have until facing the possibility of never seeing it again.

So if you're, let's say American, you will watch a French movie with the French subtitles, that is to say in your L2. Technology allows us to access DVDs with optional subtitles, including in the language of the movie. You can improve not only your listening skills but grammar and vocabulary as well. You need to watch the movie several times to get full benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get the full flavour of the movie first time you watch can be without subtitles. You might find you understand some of it because the pictures on the screen help you understand the spoken words. And the more you use this method the more you'll understand first time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second viewing activate the subtitles, obviously your eye will be drawn to the subtitles at least as much as to the picture, but don't forget, you've watched it once already. Reading helps you understand better what you hear, you can press the pause button if necessary, and even take notes if you are very keen. A good exercise is to spot the discrepancies between the spoken word and the subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third time you watch again without subtitles and you'll be amazed at how much you understand then. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent method for anyone studying on their own, outside any academic environment, but it can be done as a complement to any course. I've experienced myself with foreign languages in which I'm not fluent and on the professional side I've noticed students improving tremendously (listening skills, speaking skills and vocabulary) by watching movies in their spare time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lots of studies have highlighted the beneficial impact of watching movies in the L2. Those studies usually compare two groups of students:  a group who have watched the movie in the L2 without subtitles, a second group who have watched the movie in the L2 with subtitles. First ones I've hit upon through google (lots more to be found):  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://120.107.180.177/1832/9801/9801-14pa.pdf&quot;&gt;Insight into Learners’ Perspectives on Watching Movies with L1 vs. L2&#xA;Subtitles&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This study suggests that learners may improve their&#xA;  spelling, word recognition ability, pronunciation of new words and words they&#xA;  have already acquired, their understanding of spoken language, and intonation&#xA;  when they watch movies with the L2 subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thedawnjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/4-Dr.-Seyed.pdf&quot;&gt;Movies in EFL classrooms: with or without subtitles&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The results showed that the English subtitle group performed better than the no subtitle group on the listening test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to add that I have found that, although not detrimental,  watching foreign movies with  subtitles in the L1 is not as effective as far as improving in the L2 is concerned. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="17" LastEditDate="2016-04-11T18:41:13.443" LastActivityDate="2016-04-11T18:41:13.443" CommentCount="2" />

Listening with relevant&#xA;vocabulary is important.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make the listening activities useful and relevant to everyday life. Learning something that immediately benefits a student makes them feel good about themselves and can make learning fun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Try not to make it too difficult. It's good to push a student, but&#xA;if is consistently too hard, it can demoralize and demotivate them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make it interesting - songs and videos in the target language are a&#xA;great way to mix things up and keep things interesting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make friends with people in the target language. Talking with them can be a fun way to improve both speaking and listening. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You could also try a technique called shadowing. This technique involves listen to audio, then attempting to repeat it-- to &quot;shadow&quot; -- what you hear&#xA;as quickly as you hear it. Personally, I've not found this to be of much help, but it is worth a try.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You said that &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I also can't see any improvement with this &quot;practice&quot; methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How are you assessing this? I think assessment is important because students often lose sight of where they have come from and where they are currently at. It is important to assess listening at the start of training and later at regular intervals, so that you have a realistic record of their development.  Hopefully the results will serve to motivate them, but if for whatever reason there is no noticeable improvement (over a reasonable length of time), it will be an indicator that you (the teacher) need to change the listening materials or methods a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, take every chance to listen.

Part of the problem is &lt;strong&gt;pronunciation&lt;/strong&gt;. The grammar is &lt;strong&gt;harder than German grammar, and there are almost no Latin-based words&lt;/strong&gt; in it. The vocabulary is quite &lt;strong&gt;archaic&lt;/strong&gt;. Modern loans are typically translated into Icelandic equivalents rather than borrowed fully into Icelandic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There are four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive – as&#xA;  in German – and there are many exceptions to the case rules, or&#xA;  “quirky case,” as it is called. In quirky case, case can be marked on&#xA;  verbs, prepositions and and adjectives. The &lt;strong&gt;noun morphology system is&#xA;  highly irregular&lt;/strong&gt;. Articles can be postfixed and inflected and added to&#xA;  the noun. &lt;strong&gt;In fact, Icelandic in general is highly irregular, not just&#xA;  the nouns. Verbs are modified for tense, mood, person and number, as&#xA;  in many other IE languages&lt;/strong&gt; (this is almost gone from English). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There are up to ten tenses, but most of these are formed with auxiliaries as&#xA;  in English. Icelandic also modifies verbs for voice – active, passive&#xA;  and medial. Furthermore, there are four different kinds of verbs –&#xA;  strong, weak, reduplicating and irregular, with several conjugation&#xA;  categories in each division.  &lt;strong&gt;Many verbs just have to be&#xA;  memorized. Adjectives decline in an astounding 130 different ways, but&#xA;  many of these forms are the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Read the bolded text. Basically, Icelandic is an archaic and isolated languages with an immensely tricky pronunciation, as well as completely unfamiliar and irregular sentence structure, vocabulary, and grammar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, though I suspect the fact that while Swedish and other Scandinavian languages influenced the development of modern English because the Vikings, who invaded the British Isles several times, were from Scandinavia, Iceland remained completely isolated from Britannia. Since Iceland had no influence over English, it seems logical that it would be more difficult than other Scandinavian languages. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="91" LastActivityDate="2016-04-13T21:21:17.437" CommentCount="3" />

Often it works, the gesture restoring the memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To shorten the above, writing can help people read and interpret the text faster, which is important in mastering any language.

When typing on a keyboard, this process may be impaired. Neurophysiologists have examined research which goes a long way in confirming the significance of these differences. When writing by hand, our brain receives feedback from our motor actions, together with the sensation of touching a pencil and paper. These kinds of feedback is significantly different from those we receive when touching and typing on a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, our actions used to write send feedback back to the brain, which is allows the brain to take in information faster, rather than the poor feedback sent from a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When writing by hand, the movements involved leave a motor memory in the sensorimotor part of the brain, which helps us recognise letters. This implies a connection between reading and writing, and suggests that the sensorimotor system plays a role in the process of visual recognition during reading, Mangen explains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here, writing can also help with reading letters faster and word recognition speed.

The mixing is unconscious and is used by the child without regard of their interlocutor's understanding of both languages (Arnberg, 1987). The children are simply using words that they have acquired to communicate their needs at the given moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, an adult's mind learns languages &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; differently from a child's, however, this passage does indicate that once the brain has a reasonable grip on the language(s), it will begin to differentiate between languages more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And with regards to &lt;strong&gt;adults already reasonably familiar with two languages&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The term language mixing is also used in reference to adult bilinguals. However, in this reference, the definition is entirely different. When used to explain the speech phenomenon of specific adults, language mixing is a conscious use of a blend of two languages where interlocutors understand both languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Adult bilinguals&quot; referring to those who learned another language as L2, it seems that unconscious/involuntary language mixing is not an issue; rather it is a conscious effort, however, the parents' fluency level was not explicitly addressed, so take this note with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.hawaii.edu/~sford/research/mixing.htm&quot;&gt;[source]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another study mentioning the ease at which children overcome unintentional language mixing: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.concordia.ca/cunews/main/stories/2013/01/15/growing-up-bilingual.html&quot;&gt;http://www.concordia.ca/cunews/main/stories/2013/01/15/growing-up-bilingual.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Another model relevant for the study under consideration was proposed by Myers-Scotton (1993:75), known as the Markedness Model, in which he notes that a bilingual individual has a sense of markedness (1993:75), in regard to the relationship with the interlocutor who essentially the one choosing the code in the conversation. In such situation, the speaker is perceived as a rational actor who can make either the unmarked choice, the more secure and the more expected choice, often used by the speakers, or the marked choice which is generally unexpected in interaction (Myers-Scotton 1993:75). Nevertheless, it is essential to mention at this point that the concept of the social importance of language choice should be applied with a dose of caution to the speech of children in general as they do not play the same role in society as adult speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;generally speakers are aware of the effect of their switch&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://soar.wichita.edu/bitstream/handle/10057/5051/t11060_Brezjanovic%20Shogren.pdf&quot;&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt;, citing &lt;code&gt;Myers-Scotton, C. 1993b.

Moreover, students cannot truly master the language until they have also mastered the cultural contexts in which the language occurs. Linguistic competence alone is not enough for learners of a language to be competent in that language. From simple, everyday things, like forms of address to appropriate ways of expressing disagreement, culture forms an integral part of the language learning curricula. In any case, in order for communication to be successful, language use must be associated with other culturally appropriate behavior, not only linguistic rules in the narrow sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes that is a lot. But in short, the relationships between the culture and the actual language have been known for a very long time. By learning the language, students also learn about the cultures that use the language. So, by learning the culture, you can get a better understanding of the language and vice versa. It is practically a win-win. Culture can be used in your language anytime, from simple tasks to speaking with the leader of your country.

The study has interpreters put into a three month &quot;military boot camp&quot; for language learning and the results were amazing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After 90 days of intense training, the scientists, donning their spotless lab coats, came in and again measured their subjects’ brains. They discovered that their interpreters’ hippocampal regions, along with three other areas of the cortex, had grown significantly. The cortical areas increased in their thickness, indicating higher fire power for these areas of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, learning multiple languages can also prevent/slow down Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Learning multiple languages at a time rather than one by one is seriously less time-consuming, especially if you want to be fluent in lots of different languages. It also saves time in life and in studying time:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Imaging that you’re travelling in South America and get lost while on the way to officiate a wedding. You’re standing at an actual crossroad and looking up at two signs. The left one says “Una Via“ (One Way), the one on the right says, “Camino Cerrado Delante“ (Road Closed Ahead). Can you imagine how much driving time you’d save simply knowing what those signs mean?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One way is sequentially and the other is simultaneously. The methods are right in the names. Doing multiple languages at the same time (simultaneously) saves time because, in a way, you’re multitasking. Instead of getting fluent in one language in 1.5 years, you become fluent in 2 languages in 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also take advantage of the differences and similarities between similar languages, such as the romance languages. For example, you can take care of the cognates between languages like French, Italian, and Spanish (arm, fever, and tongue after proper translation):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you notice, the spelling, meaning and pronunciation of these words (and many, many others) are similar for French, Italian and Spanish, indicating that they have a common etymology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cognates are very useful for 2 major things... Vocabulary building... Contextualizing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are not getting bored anytime soon. You might be watching Spanish shows one day then Japanese drama shows the next. Being bored will be the least of your problems if it is at all. You probably didn't know this: learning multiple languages can help you get employed, find that perfect dream guy/girl, and understand multiple different cultures:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, Spanish and Chinese speaking skills will be one of the most critical skills sought for by recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As globalism surges forward, it makes learning multiple languages ever more essential. English isn’t enough anymore. A great number of international corporations aren’t based in English-speaking countries. In addition, US-based corporations are waking up to the fact that in order to flourish in the emerging markets, they have to learn how to say “Ni Hao” and not just “How are you?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;On the romantic end, you’ll be ready to start a bilingual relationship. When your significant other has a different first language than you, what better way is there to express affection than learning romantic phrases in their native tongue? “Sorry” is just different when you say “lo siento.” And who knows, she might just forgive you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though not really a credible source, another person's insight might prove valuable, like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/comment/593675&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;discussion on Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; (mainly the top reply):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It depends on the person. I will tell you my humble opinion, and tell how it works for me. For me, it is better to deal with multiple languages. For example, I'm learning three languages (Portuguese, Polish, German), and I'm doing well. If I have concentrated on only one language, of course I would progress faster on that language; however, concurrently learning multiple languages makes more improvement on your language knowledge in total, even if it may yield less for each language. Ah, let me explain you with an example: if I learn one language, I will proceed &quot;6 steps&quot; in that language everyday. Not bad. But if I learn two languages, I will move on &quot;4 steps&quot; everyday for each, so &quot;8 steps&quot; daily in total. And even more, if I learn three, I would get further &quot;3 steps&quot; for each, so makes &quot;9 steps&quot; in total. 9 &gt; 8 &gt; 6 . Therefore, the more languages I learn, the more total utility I get. This is my formula, and works well for me. It can be different for other people, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I run an experiment myself. I found out that, I can learn and memorize an average maximum of 20 new words per day if I study just one language. On the other hand, when I learn words from two, three or four different languages, then this number can reach 35, or even 40 words in total, per day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Also, this is not so relevant to the topic, but just I want to tell because some people have already talked about it: I believe knowing a similar language makes easier to learn the other. For instance, speaking Spanish is a significant advantage for learning Portuguese. Yes, it can be confusing sometimes (Ex: I used to write “é” (the equivalent of Spanish “es” in Portuguese) while I was doing timed practice in Spanish), but after few mistakes, you get to know your mistakes and you don't do it again. And if you know the pattern, you can easily make a Portuguese word by its Spanish equivalent without knowing the Portuguese one, and it'll mostly be correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Or, if a person learnt Polish and knows well the seven cases of Polish, then, when that person starts learning German, the four cases of German will be “as easy as pie” for that person, meanwhile many people are struggling and whining about those cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Lastly, the more you learn languages, the more your capacity of learning languages increases and the more your brain distinguishes them, consequently you commit less clashes and confusions between languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So every person has his/her own efficient way of learning languages. Some people can learn one language in a short time, some can learn many languages at the same time. So just find the best way for you, and learn =)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, this &lt;a href=&quot;http://polyglotclub.com/help/language-learning-tips/learn-several-languages-how&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;last, not-so-related article&lt;/a&gt; quickly discusses some of the disadvantages of this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Until recently, I never felt the need to learn more than one language at a time. Now that I think about it, my strict “one language only” approach was mainly for three reasons: (1) I was never in a hurry to learn languages; (2) once I chose a language, I was so involved in the learning process that I had no desire to deal with others; and (3) learning only one language at a time gave me the opportunity to polish the ones I previously learned. Now, I’ll discuss these factors in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For starters, rushing through the languages is not helpful. You are going to forget them and you waste all your time learning something you learned so fast it flew past your brain... ouch:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The first six months of the learning process are the most delicate, and one needs to focus on a given language daily and dedicate to it quality work. Time is a luxury that modern men lack, so if you split it between two, three, or even four different activities, the quality of your learning will suffer. Therefore, I personally recommend learning one language at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, learning too many at a time will prevent you from having a steady core, which disallows you to have good fluency and quick differentiating of the languages you learned, adding to confusion and question marks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The language learning process involves the use and memorization of words, structures, and sounds; however, emotions, colors, images, and memories are also involved and contribute to what I call a “language core.” Acquiring this language core is extremely important if one wants to keep the language alive in their head, even long after not having used it. Moreover, it takes time to build a language core, so attempting to speed through the learning process with multiple languages can cause language cores to overlap, or simply prevent even one from forming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The article also briefly discusses time management and a story to support it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Picking up a new language doesn’t prevent one from keeping and even refining the ones he previously learned and are obviously at a higher level. The trick is having good time management skills. By trial and error, you want to find a sustainable schedule to learn languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In order to better illustrate what I mean by “managing one’s time,” here’s a story I call “The Two Students’ Race.” Two students (both Italian) decide to compete for a challenging and ambitious goal: learning ten foreign languages. The judges give them a ten year “time budget,” and the rest is up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Student A decides that he will pick up two languages every two years. He starts by learning English and Spanish. At the end of the two years, he picks up French and German. While learning French and German, he enjoys conversing with native speakers in both English and Spanish, languages he now speaks with a certain level of fluency. He also loves reading books. By the end of the fourth year, he is relatively fluent in German and French, so he starts learning Portuguese and Swedish. At the same time, he moves to Pariswhere he gets the chance to use the four languages he learned and continue to actively learn Portuguese and Swedish. At the beginning of the sixth year, he decides to learn Mandarin and Romanian. Two years later, he finally picks up Japanese and Dutch. Then ten years later, when time is up, he speaks English, Spanish, French, and German fluently; Portuguese, Swedish, Mandarin and Romanian well; and Japanese and Dutch decently. He has weak languages, but he reached the admirable goal of building a core in more than five languages. Moreover, he will never forget these five languages. He could get rusty in them, but they will quickly come back to him. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Student B goes for the same languages, but opts for a completely different strategy—he starts learning the ten languages all at the same time. Over the years, he lacks the consistency and patience to hold onto all the languages he is learning. Sometimes he learns five, sometimes six or seven, but never ten per day. He might have brought some languages to a good level, but for the most part, his languages are at a basic level. He confuses languages such as Italian and Spanish, and Dutch and German. Many of his languages are destined to regress to a very basic level because the student did not build a linguistic core for any language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Now, the example is a bit extreme, but it gives you the general idea. People delude themselves into thinking that doing multiple things at the same time will accelerate the learning process when, in fact, it damages the learning process. Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare? Well, be the tortoise. Patience and aiming for a long-term goal will bring you success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good for your brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saves time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences and similarities will be easier to locate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Won't be bored&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tons of opportunities are opened&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn faster&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might rush through languages, lose knowledge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might not have a good core, disallowing fluency retention and fluency itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might not be good for you time-wise &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="64" LastEditorUserId="417" LastEditDate="2016-05-10T06:37:56.817" LastActivityDate="2016-05-10T06:37:56.817" CommentCount="8" />

This indicates that learners can acquire a grammatical morpheme later or earlier than predicted by the natural order, depending on the presence or absence of the equivalent category in their L1.

But after that, there are diminishing returns: the next 1000 words gives you another 7.7% of a typical text, and the next 1000 words allows you to understand just 4.3% more.  After that, the returns on memorizing by frequency decrease even more, so learning from frequency lists becomes less useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that text coverage (the percentage of words that you know in an average text) is important.

We have such vowel sounds occasionally in some English dialects, but they aren't considered significant (that is, if they are said non-nasally, they are not misunderstood), which is why most IPA transcriptions don't include the &lt;strong&gt;/◌̃/&lt;/strong&gt; nasal sign.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One example is to compare the vowel sound in the word &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;add&lt;/i&gt;.  The word &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; has a nasal quality that &lt;i&gt;add&lt;/i&gt; does not (at least in General American).

In French, Portuguese, and other languages, these sounds will happen in other parts of the word, which makes them seem difficult for native English speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One technique that can be used to nasalify (is that a word?) a vowel is, to practice it in conjunction with an &lt;strong&gt;/n/&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;/m/&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, in Portuguese, the nasal vowels are often even spelled this way (and I suppose probably evolved this way).  I suggest focusing your practice on &lt;strong&gt;/m/&lt;/strong&gt;, because it is more nasal than &lt;strong&gt;/n/&lt;/strong&gt; for the simple fact that your lips are closed, so the sound you produce with &lt;strong&gt;/m/&lt;/strong&gt; is purely nasal, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, to practice the &lt;strong&gt;/ɛ̃/&lt;/strong&gt; sound (French &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;nde&lt;/i&gt;), find a familiar word (I'll use English examples, but if you're a native speaker of some other language, substitute your own) with the same vowel sound--ideally at the beginning of the word, because that's easier to isolate.

The procedure is quite close to as Roland Coeurjoly describes. It's a social sciences methodology emulating the &quot;scientific method&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A hypothesis is made about some method -- say using colors to highlight some words in flash cards.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A procedure is drawn up.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A pilot test of the experimental procedure is run. (Depending on the format, you may or may not need to test both the experimental procedure and the control procedure).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A pretest in the relevant skill is given to assess language level in that particular skill.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Control group receives a standard teaching method or a time-wasting method. Experimental group receives the hypothetical method. Both methods should cover either the same content or content that is believed (due to prior research or some other reason for equivalency) to be of the same difficulty. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A post test is given to both groups to see how well they learned the material.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Spaced post tests may also be given depending on what is to be tested to see whether it stuck.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's several things that make it really hard to test effectiveness. First, there's no two people that are at exactly the same point in a foreign language. Second, any pretest is going to be a &lt;strong&gt;proxy&lt;/strong&gt; for language knowledge rather than an exhaustive battery. For many of the projects I've read, it's a vocabulary test looking at how deep the students' knowledge of English vocabulary is. This proxy can't test whether the content is genuinely new to all learners. (One way to disqualify some is to exclude people who have lived abroad, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, not all material is equal even if it matches some criteria for difficulty. So in one (student-level) experiment, the student picked the word &quot;acorn&quot; and the word &quot;squirrel&quot; for a vocabulary acquisition exercise. These words are both infrequent enough in the English language that they are on the same frequency level with words Japanese college students don't know. But they basically ruined the test because students &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know these words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the differences in effectiveness are often too small to detect on the sort of sample sizes I see. Part of the reason is that it's difficult to control someone's entire language learning experience. Another reason is that some things are painfully obvious -- if you don't require people to speak while learning a foreign language, many of them will be bad at speaking. Or if they never hear native input, they will have trouble listening to native speakers. But once we get past the painfully obvious, we're looking things that are &lt;em&gt;minutely&lt;/em&gt; more or less effective. And when we do that individual variables get stronger (teacher's basic ability, student's eagerness to learn, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="135" LastActivityDate="2016-04-22T00:47:20.600" CommentCount="0" />

Language transfer can be both positive and negative. So, for example, positive transfer accounts for L1 German speakers saying something like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Careful! The glass has a crack! (&lt;em&gt;Vorsicht! Das Glas hat einen Sprung!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;since the use of the definite and indefinite article is identical in such a context. But the same German speaker might ask:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do you play piano?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;since in German no article is used (&lt;em&gt;Spielst du Klavier?&lt;/em&gt;), whereas the definite article is needed in English (negative transfer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would seem therefore that there is a clear and inevitable influence of the L1 on the production of L2. Indeed, this was the strong position taken by early researchers in &lt;em&gt;Contrastive Analysis&lt;/em&gt;. For example, Lado in his &lt;em&gt;Linguistics Across Cultures&lt;/em&gt; (1957) hypothesized that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;those elements which are similar to [the learner's] native language&#xA;  will be simple for him, and those elements that are different will be&#xA;  difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as Odlin notes in the introduction to his book &lt;em&gt;Language Transfer: Cross-linguistic influence in language learning&lt;/em&gt; (Cambridge University Press, 1989) the increasing amount of empirical data about L2 learner errors that was produced in the 1970s called Lado's hypothesis into question. Odlin gives the example of the common omission of the copula by L1 Spanish speakers of English:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;... speakers of Spanish, which like English, has copula verb forms,&#xA;  frequently omit forms such as &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; or is. Moreover, such errors are not&#xA;  only found among Russian and Spanish speakers, but also among speakers&#xA;  of other languages - and also among children learning English as their&#xA;  native language. Thus, while a contrastive analysis might explain a&#xA;  Russian speaker's omission of copula forms, a Spanish contrastive&#xA;  analysis would not explain the same error as they acquire English. The&#xA;  pervasiveness of certain types of errors has thus been among the most&#xA;  significant counterarguments against the importance of transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the rest of his book Odlin analyses these counterarguments, but in the end comes to the conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the counterarguments, however, there is a large and growing&#xA;  body of research that indicates that transfer is indeed a very&#xA;  important factor in second language acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learner English: A teacher's guide to interference and other problems&lt;/em&gt; (ed. Swan &amp;amp; Smith, Cambridge University Press, 2001) aims &quot;&lt;em&gt;to help teachers anticipate the characteristic difficulties of learners of English who speak other mother tongues, and to understand how these difficulties arise&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book is clearly based on the conclusion that Odlin came to, namely that L1 transfer plays a very significant (but not exclusive) role in the production of L2. The introduction has the following text, with various references to article use:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There is less disagreement than there used to be about how far&#xA;  interlanguages are influenced by learners' native language, and most&#xA;  linguists would probably now agree that the mother tongue can affect&#xA;  learners' English in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the mother tongue has no close equivalent for a feature,&#xA;  learners are likely to have particular problems in the relevant area.&#xA;  Japanese or Russian students, for example, whose languages have no&#xA;  articles, have a great deal of difficulty with English articles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the mother tongue does have an equivalent feature, learning English is&#xA;  in general facilitated. French or German-speaking students, for&#xA;  instance, find articles relatively easy in most respects, despite the&#xA;  complexity of the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, equivalences are rarely exact, and&#xA;  so-called interference or transfer mistakes are common where students&#xA;  assume a more complete correspondence than exists, so that they carry&#xA;  over mother-tongue patterns in cases where English forms or uses&#xA;  are not in fact parallel. French or German-speaking students typically&#xA;  make certain mistakes in English (e.g. &amp;#42;&lt;em&gt;The life is hard&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#42;&lt;em&gt;My sister&#xA;  is hairdresser&lt;/em&gt;) precisely because their languages do have article&#xA;  systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, finally, the answer to the question &lt;em&gt;Does the fact that a learner's native language doesn't have articles affect their ability to use them in an L2 with articles?&lt;/em&gt; is an emphatic &lt;em&gt;Yes!&lt;/em&gt; as far as English is concerned. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see this every day with my English learners.

Even if you don't take the dictionaries down, when your eyes see it by chance, your brain will recall &lt;strong&gt;your memory related with that language&lt;/strong&gt;.

You can think about the dictionary as a good ad, an ad not about a brand but about your memory. Or if you want your kids to get enthusiastic in learning the language, you can use the dictionary to &quot;activate their curiosity&quot;, either in a passive way (just put it where they can see it frequently), or in an active way (tell them some related thing that you know).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a definition in the digital dictionary is barely information lying in the screen, which is only perceived by your eyes. The paper dictionary can carry more characteristics that can be felt by other sensory senses: the weight, the texture, the smell of papers, the turning of the book, etc. You have to use other channels besides your eyes and fingers to perceive it. This again cannot help you understand the definition easier, but it can help you &lt;strong&gt;strengthen your memory&lt;/strong&gt; once you know the definition.

When a language learner can spend hours listening to&#xA;Icelandic pop, watching Icelandic TV and Movies, reading Icelandic&#xA;comics, then it is easier than a more analytic (i.e. without&#xA;conjugations and declensions) language. When specifically comparing&#xA;against other Scandinavian languages, the quantity of&#xA;language-learner pop culture material is comparable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Icelandic uses transparent derivational morophology extensively. By this I mean you very frequently can guess a word's meaning from it's parts. In Swedish, like English, many of these parts have eroded down to where you can't recognize them. Goodbye used to be &quot;God be with you&quot;, &quot;varsågod&quot; AFAIK used to be a whole phrase too, I think the Icelandic equivalent is &quot;gerðu svo vel&quot; which is reasonably parsable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another factor is if the people prefer to speak to you in English or the language you are trying to learn. In some countries, it is difficult to get people to speak to you in your lousy (Swedish/Norwegian) when they could speak in English instead. Icelandic plays a big part in the cultural identity and on the continuum of preferences, Icelanders are more likely to prefer to speak to language learners in Icelandic. (Russians, I've notice, would rather talk to you in your bad Russian than in mutually good English, a very good situation for the language learner.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, it's a small language and the learners don't learn unless they are really motivated. This compares to the language learner community for French, which in the US is overrun by people with only a casual connection to it because they took it in high school. Being surrounded by highly motivated learners is a huge help with motivation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've got nothing to reference except a few years running an Icelandic study group/meetup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="324" LastActivityDate="2016-04-29T16:41:57.903" CommentCount="0" />

This means that, in a best-case scenario, a student learning to speak English by reading Tamil script will, in a &lt;strong&gt;best-case scenario&lt;/strong&gt;, be learning 69% of the sound &lt;strong&gt;incorrectly&lt;/strong&gt;. (Note this does not account for the relative frequency of any of the phenoms.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a more concrete example, I took your sample phrase, &quot;My name is Kolappan&quot;, and piped it through espeak to get the the IPA transcription in English:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;ma͡ɪ ne͡ɪm ɪz ˈkɑːlɐˌpæn&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I then did the same for your transcription &quot;மை நேம் இச் கோலப்பன்&quot;, and I got:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;ma͡ɪ neːm ˈit͡ʃ ˈkoːlʌppʌn&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now it's important to note that espeak's IPA transcriptions aren't always accurate, especially for certain languages, and its output is fine-tuned for its own speech algorithm, not for &quot;proper&quot; IPA output, but even so, you can see some distinct differences between the transcriptions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;ma͡ɪ n&lt;strong&gt;e͡ɪ&lt;/strong&gt;m &lt;strong&gt;ɪz&lt;/strong&gt; ˈk&lt;strong&gt;ɑː&lt;/strong&gt;l&lt;strong&gt;ɐˌ&lt;/strong&gt;p&lt;strong&gt;æ&lt;/strong&gt;n&lt;br&gt;&#xA;   ma͡ɪ n&lt;strong&gt;eː&lt;/strong&gt;m &lt;strong&gt;it͡ʃ&lt;/strong&gt; ˈk&lt;strong&gt;oː&lt;/strong&gt;l&lt;strong&gt;ʌ&lt;/strong&gt;p&lt;strong&gt;pʌ&lt;/strong&gt;n&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With 14 distinct phenoms, only 8 are the same, or 57%, in this example. And some of the differences are incredibly distinct.  For instance, pronouncing [it͡ʃ] instead of [ɪz], is likely to be frequently misunderstood.  And the pronunciation of the name is drastically different, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in summary: Transcription into one's native alphabet is a pretty poor way to learn a new language. If the goal is to avoid learning to read and write, a student would be much better of learning a new language by speaking and listening, without the use of transcription.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*Even when the IPA symbol for sounds between two languages is identical, it doesn't necessarily mean the pronunciation between them is identical.

The idea is that you learn the grammar of the language and with a dictionary are then capable of translating primarily written materials into your language.  GT is primarily suited to reading ancient languages where the value of production is minimal and the point is to be able to decipher the text precisely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was supplanted by the &lt;strong&gt;audio lingual&lt;/strong&gt; method. Here, you're going to be hearing and seeing a lot of things in the language and speaking, and you will be required to produce in that language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A further method is the &quot;Berlitz method&quot; or others like it which are all about immersion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More recently, there's also TBLT (Task-based language teaching), which is based on functional and situational use of language.

On a practical level, the differences are often (but not always) small. The proliferation of these methods is motivated by theoretical considerations about the nature of language learning. The reality is that language learning takes time and each method has advantages and disadvantages with respect to different goals. (E.g., I don't care if I can't say a single sentence in Latin (or for that matter Danish) since my goals are reading philosophical texts, but I care greatly if my Japanese is conversant and whether I can produce comprehensible e-mails and hopefully academic papers).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would doubt you had a pure GT approach in your high school. I would guess there some eclecticism in the teaching method used at your school. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, here in Japan, grammar translation (common but officially not allowed) is a crutch for instructors who themselves do not speak English to have something to say to their students where their knowledge is superior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to read me Wikipedia has several good entries on language teaching/learning methods (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_pedagogy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_pedagogy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="135" LastEditorUserId="135" LastEditDate="2016-05-09T10:57:56.200" LastActivityDate="2016-05-09T10:57:56.200" CommentCount="1" />

But the important question is where do you start having problems.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As information is lost, it becomes harder to distinguish sounds.  Actually, the auditory differences between two different sounds can be very subtle; humans who acquire a language are able to distinguish between two phonemes that really are very similar to each other from an acoustical perspective.&#xA;This means that a low quality recording is &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; lacking in important phonemic information.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This may mean that the learner is unable to notice the difference between two similar phonemes in the language, or that they are unable to distinguish between a sound in their own language and the language they are learning.  For example, if they are learning Japanese, they may not distinguish between the English &quot;r&quot; and the Japanese &quot;r&quot; (actually a flap [ɾ]).  So they may just pronounce the sound as a sound in their own language, and this pronunciation could become fossilized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this will be most likely to happen if the learner is mostly learning pronunciation through one source, the cassette tapes.  My recommendation would be never to learn the language through the one source.  If at all possible, include some real interaction with native speakers in your language learning routine.  Then you'll be getting rich phonological input, and the interaction will provide an opportunity to get feedback about your pronunciation too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="133" LastActivityDate="2016-05-10T07:18:11.260" CommentCount="4" />

I was one of the slowest readers (and learners of this skill) in my class, despite normal to superior performance in other, measurable aspects of cognition, i.e., a perfect SAT score. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had no problem reading a transliteration out loud, but when it came to text in the foreign alphabet, even years of studying Russian did not help me get faster.

If you for example learn all the parts of the body at an early stage, then you're forced to learn words like elbow and heel which are almost never used. This is demoralising since you are very likely to forget these rare words because there are so many other more common words vying for your attention, resulting in these words not being refreshed in your memory. Therefore you should just learn the most common parts of the body first. I would also say that with regard to fruit, learning apple, orange and banana is enough in the beginning unless there is a very common local fruit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, many very common words have lots of complex meanings associated with them. For example, lets say you've learned the word &quot;out&quot; in English - out is the opposite to in. Does that mean that you are going to  understand: &quot;get out&quot;, &quot;hand out&quot;, &quot;put out&quot;, &quot;knocked out&quot;, &quot;fill out&quot;, &quot;out and about&quot;, &quot;happy out&quot;, &quot;out of the question&quot;, &quot;out and out liar&quot;? So when learning word meanings as a beginner, stick to the most common meanings as it will help you a lot of the time. If when starting out you learn meanings that are not that common, chances are you will be forced to learn them again.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, when learning common words, listen to them, don't read them.

For example, &lt;em&gt;Yo soy un hombre&lt;/em&gt; may be good to start off with because it has the same structure as the equivalent English translation, &lt;em&gt;I am a man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Next, throw in some negatives in the sentences. Try &lt;em&gt;Yo no soy una mujer&lt;/em&gt; and compare it to the English &lt;em&gt;I am not a woman.&lt;/em&gt; Note that the negative word (not) comes before the verb in Spanish and after the verb in English. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once you've mastered that, try some questions. A good example might be &lt;em&gt;¿(Tú) descansas?&lt;/em&gt; while the English translation is &lt;em&gt;Did you rest?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you've done these basic tips, work out some sort of dialogue, perhaps between maybe a salesperson and a customer. Not only will this allow you to practice new vocabulary, you can also make sure you understand how to properly script questions, and it will also get you to use negatives in an answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I'm sure that word order compared to English, sentence length, concrete versus abstract and idioms are all factors.

I find that material objects like animals, foods, and colors are far more simple to use in daily speech and writing and are much simpler to grasp. (&lt;em&gt;A side note: something that I've noticed when studying Spanish all this years is that it is most often the nonmaterial or abstract concepts that are used in idiomatic expressions.&lt;/em&gt;) Like you said, it is much easier to visualize a concept before saying it, so start off with easily memorable objects in your life, then expand on to more complex, abstract vocabulary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally don't find sentence length to be a big deal as long as you know all or most of the vocabulary used in the sentence. However, the hardest idea to grasp in a foreign language is idiomatic expressions. For example, if you literally translated the sentences &lt;em&gt;Tengo quince años. También, tengo mucho hambre porque no comí.&lt;/em&gt;, you would get something like &lt;em&gt;I have fifteen years. Also, I have much hunger because I did not eat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowing Spanish idioms can help you simplify this to a more common form of English: &lt;em&gt;I am fifteen years old.

Words in a foreign language you don't speak can be recognized for various reasons. First the proper names, spelled the same but with different pronunciations. Then words of the same Indo-European roots.

Children don't judge themselves based on immediate results - although of course they eventually learn to do it as part of their 'education'. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, but the adult ego can completely block knowledge and skill acquisition for the sole reason that it does not get &lt;em&gt;visible&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;immediate&lt;/em&gt; gratification. This is a byproduct of our Pavlov-dog-based gratification education system and can block people from any kind of learning process which does not give instant results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you overcome this purely psychological barrier, you'll be able to watch/listen original material without the need to understand it all, and without &lt;em&gt;invalidating and blaming yourself&lt;/em&gt; for not being a genius. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you keep up your regular exposure you'll inevitably see results - it might take longer than you originally expected, but as a reward, your output will become natural.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let your 'subconscious' do all the hard work!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS. There is widespread belief that access to a native speaker can give you a significant boost with a foreign language. In my experience this is not the case — while it is definitely very useful, the efficiency is quite low, especially when the native speaker is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an experienced professional teacher, and you both have a fallback language. Of course, a native speaker will provide you some exposure, but won't provide &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; exposure to cause a qualitative boost. A trip to a foreign country is way more efficient, since this is exactly the case when your survival depends on being able to communicate in that language.

It goes on to say that the second section of the test is almost entirely speaking. The first portion must be passed in order to proceed to the second. This makes it quite difficult because there is no &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; skill upon which to focus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming the wiki page is correct, you have a bit of guidance since there's a gap between the first and second portions.

If the students can write without many mistakes, they will learn to speak the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also conduct reading aloud exercises, and correct their mistakes, all very gently. Also, you could also ask the rest of the class to correct the reader.

For most students it's better to speak a lot in broken English than to be paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. By immersing the students and introducing various inputs which include correct grammar (e.g. books, TV shows) you will probably help them eventually work out the correct way to speak and be understood.
