This can also reduce your control of the cut. I am in favour of moving both the work and your hand at the same time.

Cutting on a diagonal can weaken the edges of the cuts making more susceptible to damage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is definitely important to try and do the cut in one pass. Hesitation or multiple cuts can create nibs or stray fibers. This is fixable of course but you have to remove more material which can affect the shape.

Some epoxy glues also require mixing of two ingredients, which is definitely messy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For quick-and-dirty repairs, it can be better to use superglue (**acrylate**-based glues).

And the answer to why is both easy and complex.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;TL;DR: Start with one kind of needles, it doesn't really matter which kind, preferably one you can borrow, or some cheap ones, and decide after that if it feels right or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like someone already said, knitting needles are made of many different materials, the most common are wood/bamboo, metal and plastic.  But you will find other kind if you look, carbon, ivory, bone...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway…&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Wood/bamboo needles are averagely smooth and slick, it means that the yarn is less likely to fall of them by accident (their smoothness are relative to how fine their varnish is and has been polished) ;&#xD;&#xA; - Metal needles are very smooth and slick, which means the yarn slides more easily on them, and can be more sharp at the end (because metal can be shaped more easily and is much harder) ;&#xD;&#xA; - Plastic are about between wood and metal in smoothness ;&#xD;&#xA; - Carbon needles are quite smooth, they usually have metal tips ;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can find whole sets of wooden knitting needles for less than $5 on amazon, they are fine for beginners, mostly because they are cheap, and will give you an idea of what you like and dislike in needles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, **I** love knitting with metal needles, because they can be more sharp, which helps a lot for fine lace work, and the yarn slides more smoothly on them and you can knit faster.  A good friend of mine hates metal needles because they are cold and it hurts her fingers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But all of this does not really matter.  A beginner needs to begin, so, a beginner will get a ball of yarn, and read the label to know what size of needles he needs for this.  He will then get a pair of needles of that size and learn how to do a slip knot, a knit stitch, a purl stitch, and he will have started.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, why does not it really matter, well, everyone knits differently, I see it every class I teach, I always have all my students do the same thing, cast on 15 stitches, do a few rows of knit stitch (which is called garter stitch) and then alternate knit rows and purl rows (giving you stockinette), and while they are all doing the same number of stitches, and rows, their little knitted pieces are all of different sizes.  This is because we all hold our needles and yarn differently, we all have a different tension on the yarn, and in the end, our stitches are not all of the same size.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A loose knitter will not be able to knit using metal needles because the stitches will keep falling off, because their knitting is very loose, so they will prefer wooden needles, because they are less smooth, and the stitches are less likely to fall of.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A tight knitter, on the other hand, will have a hard time using wooden needles because the stitches will not want to move on the needles, and will keep forcing them to slide so that he can continue knitting.  he will most likely prefer metal or carbon needles." />

In the context of painting, the word ‘canvas’ means a fabric used as a painting surface. The difference is that sometimes the canvas is made from cotton fibres and other times from linen fibres. Each material is worth looking at in more detail.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Cotton&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Cotton is a soft, fluffy fibers that grows in a boll or protective capsule around the seeds of cotton plants. The plant is native to the Americas, Africa and India and is most often spun into yarn or thread to create a soft, breathable textile - the chances are you are wearing some cotton right now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; The advantage of cotton to you as an artist is that it is affordable and it stretches very easily. A properly prepared cotton canvas will last a long time and is the most popular surface for oil and acrylic painting, especially for students, although it is considered too flexible for very large paintings. It is classified according to its weight and surface texture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; When it comes to tightness, cotton comes out on top. It is possible to stretch cotton tighter than linen without straining the wooden support around the canvas, and a heavy-grade cotton can make up for its lack of strength and weight.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Linen&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Linen is strong and durable, and remains the preferred surface for many artists but it is expensive. It is made from the fibers of the flax plant and top quality flax is harvested mainly in Western Europe. If you want your painting to last then a linen canvas is a sound investment. The threads that make up linen, known as the warp and weft threads, weigh the same, which means they are less prone to expansion or contraction due to moisture. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Linen retains its natural oils, which helps to preserve the fibre’s flexibility and stops the canvas from going brittle. It is also regarded as having a more ‘natural’ weaved finish than cotton – a variety of textures and weights are available in both rough and smooth finishes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Because of its strength linen holds up to a heavy painting hand and does not become slack as easily as cotton canvas.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.winsornewton.com/na/discover/tips-and-techniques/other-tips-and-techniques/difference-between-canvas-and-linen" />

In that case I would suggest small safety pins, rings or feed in some floss as you move your rows. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You obviously need to be keeping count of what you are doing so it might be a good idea to at least mark the end of the row with stitch counters or something similar. Your other projects sound small so this might be good enough as long as you don't take breaks in between rows (Every time I do it i forget my numbers and have to pull back and start over). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the rows are longer then you could use a stitch counter every 10 stitches for example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some people are really adverse to using markers and think they are more of a hassle so your mileage may vary.

The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; art has evolved uniquely all over the world to adapt to different&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cultural styles.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Silhouette can refer to the art of cutting outlines or portraits out&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of black paper. [...] Contemporary papercutting is also sometimes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; associated with the art of stenciling, itself being derived from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; techniques used in graffiti art. The use of hand-cut stencils in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; graffiti art has received international attention in recent years due&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in part to the artist Banksy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also more information on [Chinese paper cutting][2], although I can't verify the accuracy of it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;[L]ong before the paper was invented... people used thin materials,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; like leaves, silver foil, silk and even leather, to carve hollowed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; patterns for beauty. Later, when paper was invented, people realized&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that this material was easy to cut, store and discard. Thus paper&#xD;&#xA;&gt; became the major material for them to use, and people habitually&#xD;&#xA;&gt; called this artistry paper-cutting, or Jianzhi in Chinese.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And [Jewish paper cutting][3]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Jewish paper cutting is a traditional form of Jewish folk art made by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cutting figures and sentences in paper or parchment. It is connected&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with various customs and ceremonies, and associated with holidays and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; family life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A couple of examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![The cover of the family tree book created by Yehudit Shadur][5]][5]&#xD;&#xA;[![Chinese papercutting.

In the context of painting, the word ‘canvas’ means a fabric used as a painting surface. The difference is that sometimes the canvas is made from cotton fibres and other times from linen fibres. Each material is worth looking at in more detail.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ##Cotton&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Cotton is a soft, fluffy fibers that grows in a boll or protective capsule around the seeds of cotton plants. The plant is native to the Americas, Africa and India and is most often spun into yarn or thread to create a soft, breathable textile - the chances are you are wearing some cotton right now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The advantage of cotton to you as an artist is that it is affordable and it stretches very easily. A properly prepared cotton canvas will last a long time and is the most popular surface for oil and acrylic painting, especially for students, although it is considered too flexible for very large paintings. It is classified according to its weight and surface texture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When it comes to tightness, cotton comes out on top. It is possible to stretch cotton tighter than linen without straining the wooden support around the canvas, and a heavy-grade cotton can make up for its lack of strength and weight.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ##Linen&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Linen is strong and durable, and remains the preferred surface for many artists but it is expensive. It is made from the fibers of the flax plant and top quality flax is harvested mainly in Western Europe. If you want your painting to last then a linen canvas is a sound investment. The threads that make up linen, known as the warp and weft threads, weigh the same, which means they are less prone to expansion or contraction due to moisture. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Linen retains its natural oils, which helps to preserve the fibre’s flexibility and stops the canvas from going brittle. It is also regarded as having a more ‘natural’ weaved finish than cotton – a variety of textures and weights are available in both rough and smooth finishes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Because of its strength linen holds up to a heavy painting hand and does not become slack as easily as cotton canvas.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.winsornewton.com/na/discover/tips-and-techniques/other-tips-and-techniques/difference-between-canvas-and-linen" />

Text="Big factor to this would be to make sure your cuts are straight and not at an angle. If your cuts meet on top but are not completely vertical then a tuft would appear on the bottom of the paper for example. This can be hard to work with since the blade of a craft knife is already at an angle. This leads into one possible solution. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Depending on what you are willing to get away with as far as quality or experience one sure fire way to try and address this is too over cut your lines just a bit. When trying to meet at an edge or a corner it sounds like you are coming a bit short. That is what is creating the tufts. If you over cut the line just a bit that should account for that and make the corner or edge clean. Problem with this approach if done wrong you can cut too far in which can ruin the piece. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You don't even have to do it too much. Just enough to account for my first paragraph. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am sure you are already doing this but for the sake of completeness your cutting surface plays a roll here. Something simple like a self healing cutting mat will help prevent your paper from moving too much. Sometime changes in hand pressure can move the paper enough that it starts to pull away from the cut line. A proper mat should help immobilize the work more. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;___&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Usually I use printer paper or origami paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not sure if this is the best advice, as it could be tedious to consider, but common computer/printer paper has a grain direction. If you look at a common 8 1/2 x 11 you should see that the fibers are lined up from top to bottom. You can also &quot;feel&quot; this when you bow the paper in opposite directions. Folding it from top to bottom has a little more resistance that it does from the left and right sides. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Point being is that if you are making cuts it is that second cut that will be an issue. If you can make it so the second cut is the one that cross the grain of the paper it is less likely to tear off. Holding the paper behind the cut can also help mitigate this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I cut out a lot of names printed from fancy fonts and this happens to me as well." />

Some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Machine Washability** Silk and pure wool arn't machine washable, cotton and most synthetics are, linen is actually improved by being machine washed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Breathability** All of the natural fibers (wool, silk, cotton, linen, etc.) breathe, but the synthetics (acrylic, polyester, etc.) don't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**&quot;Stickiness&quot;** Certain techniques (drop stitches, felting) require the built-in self-gripping of wool and similar animal fibers. This also impacts things like cotton's known tendency to droop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Elasticity** This is the fiber's ability to stretch and contract, which affects an item's ability to regain its orignial shape as well as how wearing the yarn is to knit with (hand fatigue). Animal fibers and some synthetics are stretchy, while plant fibers aren't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Allergies &amp; Sensitivities** Wool is the infamous one in both these categories, though synthetics can be problematic, too. Plant fibers do better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, the closer you stick to the recommended fiber type, the more predictable the results will be (replacing cotton with wool is riskier than replacing it with linen).

Drawing some information from [this guide][1], we can get started.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Start by preheating your oven to 200 F or 90 C. Make sure your Play-Doh sculpture is stable, and place it on a sheet of aluminum foil on top of a cookie sheet or something comparable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Bake the sculpture for 10 - 15 minutes. If you have thicker parts on the sculpture, you'll have to bake for longer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. I recommend making some test sculpture, like simple tubes, of different thicknesses. By baking these, you can test out how long it takes in your particular oven. You can test if the bake was long enough by breaking the test tube in half and making sure the moisture is can from the center. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. After it's baked, you'll need to apply a varnish to seal the sculpture. You'll want a product that's water proof, and most will do that. Avoid spray varnishes, because the propellant chemicals may affect the sculpture over time. There are varnishes specifically for sculptures, but some people have had success with sculpture by using clear wood finishes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - When you apply the varnish, make sure you you get every spot. Use a fine brush to get into crevices. After the first coat dries, go back over to get the bottom of the sculpture an wherever you held it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And that should do it. Of course, I would test it with a lump, first, to make sure the varnish you're using doesn't result in a sticky texture or soften the Play-Doh as you apply it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ehow.com/how_8601446_harden-play-dough.html" />

I will create a template piece out of a stiff piece of paper. This paper has my design drawn on it with pencil or whatever.&#xD;&#xA;  -  Then I cut out the design on that paper. &#xD;&#xA;  - Once done, you lay the template over your final paper, and secure it with some type of clips. You want to make sure the template doesn't slip around. &#xD;&#xA;  - Then, you cut out the design just as you would use a pencil with a stencil. &#xD;&#xA;  - There's no need to create the *entire* design in your template piece. You can create small pieces, just as you would use a [French curve][1], eraser shield, or stencil.&#xD;&#xA; 2. I simply draw the design *in reverse* on the back of the paper you're using, if it's meant to be viewed only from one side. Use a light pencil and make your cuts. The final product will not have the lines visible, as they're on the back.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Erasing marks afterwards has not been successful for me.

If allowed to harden (to preserve a creation) it will most likely crack.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Look for oven curable clay at your local craft stores to make long lasting creations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which isn't helpful, since it essentially says &quot;you can't&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, you can attempt to bake and seal it. Drawing some information from [this guide][1], we can get started.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Start by preheating your oven to 200°F or 90°C. Make sure your Play-Doh sculpture is stable, and place it on a sheet of aluminum foil on top of a cookie sheet or something comparable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Bake the sculpture for 10&amp;ndash;15 minutes. If you have thicker parts on the sculpture, you'll have to bake for longer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. I recommend making some test sculpture, like simple tubes, of different thicknesses. By baking these, you can test out how long it takes in your particular oven. You can test if the bake was long enough by breaking the test tube in half and making sure the moisture is gone from the center. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. After it's baked, you'll need to apply a varnish to seal the sculpture. You'll want a product that's water proof, and most will do that. Avoid spray varnishes, because the propellant chemicals may affect the sculpture over time. There are varnishes specifically for sculptures, but some people have had success with sculpture by using clear wood finishes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - When you apply the varnish, make sure you get every spot. Use a fine brush to get into crevices. After the first coat dries, go back over to get the bottom of the sculpture and wherever you held it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And that should do it. Of course, I would test it with a lump, first, to make sure the varnish you're using doesn't result in a sticky texture or soften the Play-Doh as you apply it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ehow.com/how_8601446_harden-play-dough.html" />

Be careful if you need stretch, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Add some weight to the cast-on** This can be done by putting some stitch markers in the cast-on (helps get the number of stitches right, too!) or by knitting a short provisional section flat and then joining (you go back later, unravel the provisional section, and use that yarn to cast-off).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Try DPNs** If the cable part is what grieves you, you might try casting on with double-point needles, instead.

There are many great resources, but I'll show a simple demo here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is using a single light source and a simple box form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are the construction steps I used to create that final image:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Lay down your horizon line and choose your vanishing points (VP). &#xD;&#xA; 2. Draw your shape (here the blue box) in perspective. Use standard perspective technique, connecting points on your shape to the relevant VP. Make sure you draw the hidden part of the object (the back), because that can affect the shadow shape.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Assign a place for your Light Source. This is up to up. The horizontal distance from your object will determine the rotation of the shadow. The vertical distance from the horizon will affect the length of the shadow, with greater distance shortening shadows (just like at high noon). &#xD;&#xA; 4. From your light source, draw Shadow Perspective Lines to the top vertex points of your shape.&#xD;&#xA; 5. From your Horizon Light Point (AKA light vanishing point) draw the Shadow Perspective Lines connecting to the bottom points corresponding to the points from step 4.&#xD;&#xA; 6. Find the intersection of the SPLs from vertexes connected by common edges.&#xD;&#xA; 7. Connect these SPL intersections. They are the boundaries of your shadow.&#xD;&#xA; 8. Connect the remaning SPL intersections to the ground-level vertex of the object by following your SPL to the horizon light vanishing point. (Usually, you don't have to think about it and just connected it to the logical corner.)&#xD;&#xA; 9. Shade in between those boundaries you just made.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Things get more complicated as your shape gets more complicated, is not resting on the ground, or has curves. The guide I linked to earlier has information on casting shadows from the air, and onto other objects instead of the ground. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can cast shadows of curved objects by creating a shadow map of the box you could draw around your perspective object. [The Virtual Instructor][3] has some examples of shadows of circular and spherical objects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more information, you'll want to find resources regarding drawing in perspective, and especially shadows in perspective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Multiple light sources and ambient light will further complicate your drawing. Getting this done correctly may be less a matter of calculation and more a case for studying how shadows work in the real world. Observation and reference will be your best friend there, especially as you learn about how light and shade works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.architecturerevived.com/shadow-in-perspective-drawing-art-technique/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/H7gXj.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://thevirtualinstructor.com/how-to-draw-paint-cast-shadows.html" />

Left-handed pencil users can also take advantage of smudge-resistant H leads. On the downside, hard leads tend to be scratchy, especially as you move up the scale. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; B leads are smooth to write and draw with. They smudge easily, but are readily erased.

Because your brain is pretty good at making what you think should be white look like white, these lights can cause your eyes to see the colors differently and, as a result, change the way you mix or blend in your work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As with photography, we can control the light we use and select for what our eyes naturally tend to, which is daylight. Where possible, you should light your work with dedicated lamps using daylight balanced light bulbs with a color temperature in and around 5500K. The packaging should specify the color temperature, which is more reliable than if it merely says daylight on the package, so avoid those that don't or that claim a temperature way off that number. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I really recommend getting some decent swing-arm desk lamps and LED bulbs. Not only are these lamps cheaper, but they're usually a lot brighter and much easier to position, especially with easels. LEDs are really efficient and they don't heat you up when working in close quarters, making for a more comfortable experience." />

Don't sacrifice in an attempt to increase efficiency. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would consider making a small ramp of jig that would give you a 60 degree angle. Looking at an edge view from the wiki that can help ensure the best angles when sanding. You can try and use a set of small squeeze clamps to help keep your fingers out of harms way.

When making box joints or finger joints you need to have dimensionally uniform and preferably stable wood. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Plywood comes in many sizes and I would imagine something like 8mm would be fine. If you are OK with something larger like 16mm then you would have stronger joints as there would be more surface area.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is dependent on what tools you have. A box joint jig on a table saw would make this a breeze. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;I read here that pine wood is easy to shape and stain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pine is cheap. That is its main advantage. Most softwood is easy to shape by nature. Easy to stain is inaccurate as pine (and other woods) is susceptible to blotching.

Text="Using scissors, as you have pictured, would be a contributing factor here. Using a craft knife or something something similar would most certainly be the go to tool. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to try to do the cutting in one motion - to not lift the blade from the paper. So if you were cutting this on a mat, when you need to change direction you can rotate the paper accordingly. Craft knives have fine points so turning it is not likely to damage too much. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of the specific Y, using a craft knife, I would also consider the starting point of the cuts to be the intersection shown and then cut away from that point. That approach is more case-by-case and really is dependent on your overall design. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you insist on using scissors, the only tip I have to offer is to try and keep cutting as you are turning the paper. Try and finish the whole cut in one motion of the scissors. That would help stop the start of a tear. Hands and the tool itself can make that hard." />

Using a craft knife or something something similar would most certainly be the go to tool. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to try to do the cutting in one motion - to not lift the blade from the paper and, if possible, not change the pressure you are exerting on the scissors. So if you were cutting this on a mat, when you need to change direction you can rotate the paper accordingly. Craft knives have fine points so turning it is not likely to damage too much. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of the specific Y, using a craft knife, I would also consider the starting point of the cuts to be the intersection shown and then cut away from that point. That approach is more case-by-case and really is dependent on your overall design. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you insist on using scissors, the only tip I have to offer is to try and keep cutting as you are turning the paper. Try and finish the whole cut in one motion of the scissors. That would help stop the start of a tear. Hands and the tool itself can make that hard." />

If your cuts meet on top but are not completely vertical then a tuft would appear on the bottom of the paper, for example. This can be hard to work with since the blade of a craft knife is already at an angle. This leads into one possible solution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Depending on what you are willing to get away with as far as quality or experience, one surefire way to try and address this is to over-cut your lines just a bit. When trying to meet at an edge or a corner it sounds like you are coming a bit short. That is what is creating the tufts. If you over-cut the line just a bit that should account for that and make the corner or edge clean. Problem with this approach is if done wrong you can cut too far in which can ruin the piece.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You don't even have to do it too much. Just enough to account for my first paragraph. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am sure you are already doing this but for the sake of completeness your cutting surface plays a role here. Something simple like a self healing cutting mat will help prevent your paper from moving too much. Sometimes changes in hand pressure can move the paper enough that it starts to pull away from the cut line. A proper mat should help immobilize the work more. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;___&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Usually I use printer paper or origami paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not sure if this is the best advice, as it could be tedious to consider, but common computer/printer paper has a grain direction. If you look at a common 8 1/2 x 11 you should see that the fibers are lined up from top to bottom. You can also &quot;feel&quot; this when you bow the paper in opposite directions. Folding it from top to bottom has a little more resistance that it does from the left and right sides. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Point being if you are making cuts it is that second cut that will be an issue. If you can make it so the second cut is the one that cross the grain of the paper it is less likely to tear off. Holding the paper behind the cut can also help mitigate this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I cut out a lot of names printed from fancy fonts and this happens to me as well." />

Mostly printed computer paper from 150 for 300 pages for the contents. This is what I did as far as the spine is concerned:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Get the pages together by gently knocking them on the table and rotating it so that I was knocking consistently in all directions. &#xD;&#xA;2. Brace the spine on either side with clamps and paint stick so that only a millimetre or two was exposed. &#xD;&#xA;3. Sand the paper to ruffle up the fibres. Theory for that is more surface area for the glue to bind. &#xD;&#xA;4. Slighty dampen the paper on the spine to help the glue penetrate more. &#xD;&#xA;5. Using contact cement apply a couple of coats (separated by about day to be sure). I had tried Gorrila Glue a couple of time thinking the expansion would help but it just made the spine larger and I had to remove the curve it created.&#xD;&#xA;6. Continue on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that did work and I made about 20 books successfully. However I wasn't 100% happy with the product. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes there would be single pages that did not get an equal amount of glue. So I would be using the book and open a page and turn it just to have it pop out. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I gauged the strength of the book by trying to lift it up by one of the pages.

Get the pages together by gently knocking them on the table and rotating it so that I was knocking consistently in all directions. &#xD;&#xA;2.

Next, pass the needle partway through the good side of the other piece of cloth at the closest location where the pieces meet. Don't pull the thread too tightly; you'll need space to perform the next step. Now that the tip of your needle is on the inside of the plushie, pass it through to the outside and pull the whole needle out. Repeat. Remember to pull the earlier stitches tight at some point, once you don't need the wiggle room.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This one, when pulled taut, closes neatly, holding the two halves pretty much flush with each other and looking very neat, but it isn't quite as strong as the latter, and when mistreated, it will just pull apart, revealing the needlework, crumpling the cloth laterally, and losing the whole appeal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [Baseball Stitch](http://stardustshoes.blogspot.com/2009/04/baseball-stitch.html) - same as on a baseball ball, except pulled taut such that it forces the material to fold and crumple, is much stronger, but when pulled taut, the sides don't form such a neat, flush connection, but form a shallow groove, and the needlework may be visible if one peers into it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just push the needle from the inner side of the material onto the outer, and cross to the other side, repeating, inner to outer. When pulled taut, it crumples the material left inside into two &quot;bars&quot;, which provide tension to the stitch preventing it from coming apart, and pressing against each other pull it inside, forming the characteristic groove. It requires much more force to break and doesn't crumple the visible surface of the cloth when strained, but if it does come apart somewhat, due to abuse, the needlework will show more, and even perfectly new it will form a deeper and more visible groove than the Ladder stitch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.metroidhat.com/mother/materialstechniques.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/2KcPP.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/W5UEe.jpg" />

I have personally never combined the two in a single project. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Charcoal**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Charcoal is generally much darker, bolder and messier. It's easy to fade charcoal or wipe it off the paper entirely if you make mistakes. Charcoal, due to its brittle nature is also easy to smudge or gently wipe to assist in your shading efforts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Charcoal artwork needs to be treated after you're finished with the work as the particles (essentially dust) will fall from the artwork over time and may either leave dark streaks on the artwork or just cause the art to fade as the particles fall over the art or off of it all together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Graphite**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Graphite is a slightly harder to shade with, and doesn't usually get as dark as charcoal. Some of the darker graphites, like an 8B, tend to look glossy and reflective when used over large areas. This is something charcoal does not do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Graphite can be easily shaded with the help of tortilons, though, and varying pressure in combination with pencil grades can give you a very wide range of shades to work with. Graphite also lasts on the paper without particles falling off and can remain in-tact for years as long as its not being touched or rubbed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Paper**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The paper you use plays a big role on the art itself. Some papers, like newsprint are great for quick charcoal sketching and practice. Charcoal easily wipes from newsprint and it's cheap, while graphite is hardly visible. Higher quality papers are less forgiving of errors, but the finished product will look nicer." />

Remember to pull the earlier stitches tight at some point, once you don't need the wiggle room.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This one, when pulled taut, closes neatly, holding the two halves pretty much flush with each other and looking very neat, but it isn't quite as strong as the latter, and when mistreated, it will just pull apart, revealing the needlework, crumpling the cloth laterally, and losing the whole appeal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [Baseball Stitch](http://stardustshoes.blogspot.com/2009/04/baseball-stitch.html) - same as on a baseball ball, except pulled taut such that it forces the material to fold and crumple, is much stronger, but when pulled taut, the sides don't form such a neat, flush connection, but form a shallow groove, and the needlework may be visible if one peers into it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just push the needle from the inner side of the material onto the outer, and cross to the other side, repeating, inner to outer. When pulled taut, it crumples the material left inside into two &quot;bars&quot;, which provide tension to the stitch preventing it from coming apart, and pressing against each other pull it inside, forming the characteristic groove. It requires much more force to break and doesn't crumple the visible surface of the cloth when strained, but if it does come apart somewhat, due to abuse, the needlework will show more, and even perfectly new it will form a deeper and more visible groove than the Ladder stitch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let me add that in your situation, where you're repairing items that were already subjected to abuse and likely will continue to, the baseball stitch is a better choice, as despite worse initial appearance, it doesn't degrade nearly as much when abused.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.metroidhat.com/mother/materialstechniques.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/2KcPP.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/W5UEe.jpg" />

This is the stuff you want for most jewellery (excluding things that need to bend such as necklaces (though you should be looking at chain for those anyway)).&#xD;&#xA;- **Dead-soft**, which is just plain wire that hasn't been at all hardened. This needs minimal force from your hands to bend. I suspect you've been buying this kind of stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The hardness also depends to an extent on the material - the cheaper stuff like copper and brass is generally manufactured at softer grades.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bear in mind that you can also harden existing soft wire by either applying heat to it (i.e. a blow-torch or other high-intensity heat - a match won't do it), or applying pressure to it (hammer it - just remember that this also reduces the diameter).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can ask when you're buying the wire what grade it is, or look on whatever packaging it comes in to see if it's marked." />

You also forgot to mention blending and basic scribbling.

As you can see in the above picture it is still a dragon regardless of the shading technique used. Personal preference would play a large role in this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could use a combination of cross and regular hatching as a means of having different levels of darkness but that is not the sole way of doing it.

Here are some tips and tricks I have learned over time:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Hammering:** A regular jewelry hammer will change the shape of the wire unless you use a jewelry hammer with a rubber or nylon head. It really only works on flat pieces and is kind of time intensive.&#xD;&#xA; - **Nylon Jaw Pliers:** Pulling the wire through nylon jaw pliers one or more times before you work with it will not only work-harden the wire, it will also straighten out any kinks or bumps in the wire. Use pliers with replaceable nylon pads because they do wear out eventually.&#xD;&#xA; - **Steel Wool:** Pulling uncoated (copper, sterling silver, fine silver, brass, gold-fill, etc) through fine steel wool (#000 or #0000 if I recall) will not only clean and straighten the wire but will work harden it a bit as well depending on how many times you pull it through.&#xD;&#xA; - **Tumbling with Jewelry Shot:** Placing the finished piece in a jewelry tumbler (assuming any stones used are safe to tumble) with jewelry shot, water, and a little soap is a favorite of mine since the whole finished piece gets thrown in. After several hours the finished piece is hardened and much shinier as well! &#xD;&#xA; - **Buying Harder Wire:** Make small rings, earwires, and smaller items with half-hard wire. My personal favorite is 21-gauge half-hard for earwires for earrings that aren't very heavy. &#xD;&#xA; - **Buy Ready-Made Components:** I like working with copper wire but I don't like it for ear wires for a number of reasons, it really is too soft and there are some metal sensitivity concerns for some people. I will often finish off copper earrings with purchased rose gold or rose gold plated ear wires. The color still matches and they're much harder than I can ever work harden copper wire. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This list is probably not complete but contains things that I have done and have worked for me. Some things may work for your piece and some may not. You might have to experiment to see what works for the particular type of wire you're using." />

The term 'left-hand knitting', however, is discouraged by left-handed knitters because it leads to misunderstandings. Unlike English knitting, the tip of the working needle is used to hook the yarn and bring it forward; the motion is thus sometimes known as picking. Continental knitting can be done at a greater rate than English knitting, as the stitches are formed closer to the needle points and the yarn has a shorter travel...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;English knitting, also known as right-hand knitting or throwing, is a style of Western knitting where the yarn to be knit into the fabric is carried in the right hand. This style is prevalent throughout the English-speaking world, though it is by no means universal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other Western knitting styles include continental knitting (also known as &quot;left-hand knitting&quot;) and combined knitting. Despite the names, choice of knitting style has little to do with the handedness of the knitter; plenty of left-handed individuals use the English style, and plenty of right-handed knitters use Continental. Various non-Western styles also exist, many of which are substantially similar to these, but which twist each stitch, making for a subtly different-looking fabric... but this can also be called French Knitting... &#xD;&#xA;" />

This grip is good at doing fine detailed work and short strokes. **That makes it very helpful for doing all the methods you mentioned, *when the scale is small***. That is to say, when the strokes you're making are small and detailed. You can do very fine crosshatching on a very large piece, or do large crosshatching on the same piece. When drawing at an incline, such as on an easel or drafting table, this grip is generally only used for detail work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Paintbrush/brush Grip&#xD;&#xA;This grip has you hold the pencil further up the shaft and along your index finger (see pictures). This grip makes it easier to apply lighter strokes to your piece. **If your shading method requires you to apply strokes of different pressure, this grip may help you more.** Building up your values one &quot;layer&quot; of shading at a time is a very common method, used with or without the aid of blending. **The standard grip makes it easy to press too hard, often making the brush grip a better choice for building up value.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can combine the pressure control with any of the methods you listed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1] [![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Underhand grip&#xD;&#xA;I call this one underhand, but I've seen it called violin bow grip and also drumstick grip. Basically, you hold the pencil between the tips of your thumb and index finger, but your palm faces up (see picture). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The site I used for the picture][3] already has a great explanation of what kinds of shading this is used for:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt;This grip is *the* preferable basic drawing grip. It does not need a propped arm, and the motion range is limited only by your arm span; it produces flowing, economical sweeping line and is ideal for rough sketching, **hatching and tonal work with the side of lead**. It works best on big page and a near-vertical plane (paper pinned to board), and is the preferred grip in academic drawing. It enables working with the lead’s side, for darker flowing lines and shading. It cannot be used with Wacom stylus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This really is the best grip for using the side of the lead, especially when you're using a properly-sharpened pencil. *Using the side of the lead allows you to lay down varying widths of solid tone. That makes this grip ideal for certain types of blending.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This grip also allows you to make fairly detailed hatch/crosshatch marks, although not as detailed as the standard grip. Generally, when you use this grip you keep your wrist stiff and move the pencil with your shoulder and elbow.

It's rarely used, because it's just *too* stiff for most jewellery.&#xD;&#xA;- **Half-hard**, which is hardened during manufacture but is not fully tempered and is not so hard. It's pliable by hand, but you need to use some force to do it and pliers are often easier. This is the stuff you want for most jewellery (excluding things that need to bend such as necklaces (though you should be looking at chain for those anyway)).&#xD;&#xA;- **Dead-soft**, which is just plain wire that hasn't been at all hardened. This needs minimal force from your hands to bend. I suspect you've been buying this kind of stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The hardness also depends to an extent on the material - the cheaper stuff like copper and brass is generally manufactured at softer grades.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bear in mind that you can also harden existing soft wire by either applying heat to it (i.e. a blow-torch or other high-intensity heat - a match won't do it) and then quenching it (drop it straight into cold water), or applying pressure to it (hammer it - just remember that this also reduces the diameter).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can ask when you're buying the wire what grade it is, or look on whatever packaging it comes in to see if it's marked." />

Special techniques like the ones you mentioned are required for pen and ink projects because pens don't naturally provide a way to fade from light to dark the way graphite does. Since an area is either black or white when using a pen, special techniques are used to demonstrate the illusion of shade when in fact it's all jet black or stark white.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Pencil Shading**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for shading with a pencil, I find the sharpness of the edge to be more important than the angle of the stroke. If you are using a freshly sharpened pencil you'll likely wind up with dark hard lines. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using a rounded or dull tip allows you to shade more evenly and smoothly without the need to hold the pencil at an angle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have softer strokes (from using a rounded or dull pencil), they can easily be blended together with a tortillon. A tortillon is rolled paper, designed to help smooth the strokes of a pencil and improve the smoothness of your shading. A properly shaded sphere in pencil is depicted below with the use of a tortillon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/LC5ID.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/4TzGs.jpg" />

" Text="&#xD;&#xA;**Shading Techniques**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First of all, the shading techniques you mentioned are primarily used for pen-and-ink projects and are not commonly used when shading with a pencil. Special techniques like the ones you mentioned are required for pen and ink projects because pens don't naturally provide a way to fade from light to dark the way graphite does. Since an area is either black or white when using a pen, special techniques are used to demonstrate the illusion of shade when in fact it's all jet black or stark white.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Pencil Shading**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for shading with a pencil, I find the sharpness of the edge to be more important than the angle of the stroke. If you are using a freshly sharpened pencil you'll likely wind up with dark hard lines. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using a rounded or dull tip allows you to shade more evenly and smoothly without the need to hold the pencil at an angle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have softer strokes (from using a rounded or dull pencil), they can easily be blended together with a tortillon. A tortillon is rolled paper, designed to help smooth the strokes of a pencil and improve the smoothness of your shading. A properly shaded sphere in pencil is depicted below with the use of a tortillon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/LC5ID.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/4TzGs.jpg" />

If you regularly draw on a horizontal surface, you'll spend a lot of time with your head down. This is terrible for your neck! It can lead to sore, tight muscles. Or, if you have neck problems (like I do), it can be downright painful to even try to draw like that for any length of time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Perspective&#xD;&#xA;Having the desk at an incline allows you to have a better vantage point of your work. You can more or less have your eyes even with the center of the work piece. This means you're less likely to distort your drawing with perspective problems. When you're head down on a flat surface, your visual focal point is generally aligned to a single spot. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To understand what I mean, take a look at this sidewalk chalk art.&#xD;&#xA;This is how it actually looks:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is how it looks from a specific vantage point:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of drawing on a flat plane, you may end up drawing a distorted, stretched out image, but your mind perceives it as perfectly proportional. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can avoid that by using measurements and taking breaks to look at the piece from different angles, but it's a little more work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Drawing grip&#xD;&#xA;To me, this can be the biggest advantage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having an inclined plane allows you to use an underhand or paint brush grip with ease. These grips allow you to control your pencil by using your shoulder and elbow, instead of your wrist. Long, even, consistent lines are possible when using your whole arm. These grips, and your lines, will have a more natural and relaxed feel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, these grips aren't necessarily a benefit for all types of drawing. Generally, I'll use them for life drawings and similar work, but not for small character sketches. I still use an inclined drafting desk or tabletop easel whenever I can, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/RUNxkm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/QzGPym.jpg" />

Even with a lot of &quot;extra&quot; stitches in each row you should be able to eventually create a flat piece.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I haven't made snowflakes in years so I don't remember the exact process but if I were to do one today I would probably do something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Wet the finished piece with water&#xD;&#xA; 2. On an ironing board (because the cover/padding is soft) I would lay the damp (or wet, doesn't matter) piece out as flat as I could and then using straight sewing pins I would start stretching and &quot;anchoring&quot; all the the edges by poking the pins down into the ironing board padding. If you have a fancy ironing board cover you might want to rethink making pin holes in it but a fabric cover is okay.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Once your piece is stretched out and evenly anchored with pins let it air dry (it should hold its shape).&#xD;&#xA; 4. Get your iron and turn it on to a heat setting appropriate for the type of yarn/thread you used, hopefully your thread can tolerate at least the lowest steam setting. You will be pressing the snowflake *before starching*.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Now with your iron heated up (and hopefully steaming) carefully remove the pins *from one point only* of the snowflake and gently press the iron onto that point. You might want to use a thin cloth or pressing cloth between the iron and the snowflake.&#xD;&#xA; 6. Repeat for all of the snowflake points and gently press with the iron. You should now have a nice flat snowflake. Allow it to fully cool.&#xD;&#xA; 7. This is point where you mix the starch. If I recall I used *Lacy's Stiff Stuff* (available at U.S. craft stores). I would think that *Mod Podge* could also be used but I haven't tried that. The consistency should be just thin enough to soak into the fiber without gooping up on the surface. You want it to be able to penetrate but not puddle too much underneath.&#xD;&#xA; 8. Carefully place the flattened, cooled snowflake on a piece of waxed or parchment paper and carefully apply the stiffener/starch with a craft brush, allowing the starch to soak into the fibers of the snowflake. Get as much stiffener as you can to soak in without it pooling underneath.&#xD;&#xA; 9. While the stiffener is still wet I like to add a bit of superfine iridescent glitter because I'm crafty. Allow the snowflake to fully dry.&#xD;&#xA; 10. Carefully peel the snowflake from the waxed paper and admire your handiwork!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's just one way to do it. As I was typing I realized that you could skip the ironing step entirely and just soak the newly-crocheted piece in the stiffener until it is saturated then place it on the waxed paper and &quot;coax&quot; it into shape as it dries with your fingers and/or pins as above. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Make sure you use waxed (or parchment) paper between the snowflake and the ironing board (or other pinnable surface) if you're using pins. Let it dry fully and you have the same result. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have used both methods. Going through the ironing steps at least let me know what the finished product would look like and if it's even going to look good before wasting stiffener." />

All of these can have their own downsides but they're worth considering. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that, realistically, if you can't tell whether something is &quot;sport&quot; or &quot;DK&quot; but you know it's one of the two, it's probably not going to throw you off too badly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note that the US and the UK have different terms for the same weights of yarn but that since stores sell yarn from around the world, you're likely to run into all of them regardless of where you live.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Wrapping&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Wrapping][1] is a method of testing the weight by seeing how many widths of yarn fit in an inch of space. It looks a bit like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Wrapping to measure yarn weight][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can wrap around the ruler itself or around something else like a pencil. The fewer widths of yarn that fit in an inch, the heavier the yarn is. Note that for thicker yarns, you might want to wrap more than an inch and divide to get a better count.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The downside of this is that not everyone wraps the same and yarn is squishy. They yarn in the image is very neatly wrapped but you could easily squash it together and get another 3-4 wraps in that inch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Ply or strands&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Generally* heavier-weight yarns have more strands. This can be finicky with smaller weight yarns and it won't always give you the information you need because there's no real standard but if your yarn only has 2-3 strands, it's probably really light weight and if it's worsted it's probably 10 or 12 ply. So, if you use this in combination with wrapping (or some common sense) it will probably help you. There's a list of the ply to weight name chart on [Ravelry][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###By Gauge&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can determine whether an unknown ball of yarn will work for your project by making a gauge swatch. This requires that you are pretty comfortable with your stitching and are consistent but it should help. Use the recommended sized hook or needle for the project and follow the instructions for determining gauge for the project (if it includes those instructions) or use a base guide like the one [here][4]. If the stitch count per four inch swatch is really off, then it won't work. If it's good and it looks the way you expect, then go for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, you should adjust for your own stitch style. If you know that you normally need to crochet with a 5.5 mm hook when the recommended size is 6.5, then crochet the sample with the 5.5 mm hook rather than the recommended one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###By Weight&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some people have really good scales. If you measure how long your yarn is and then weigh it (in grams) you should be able to find out the weight... because everyone wants to spend hours measuring the length of their yarn. The better your scale is (and heavier the weight), the shorter the length of yarn you can weigh. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd recommend that you weigh at least 10-20 grams worth of yarn and then figure out the length. Note that you don't have to cut the yarn to do this, just let the remainder hang off the scale and mark the measurement stop point with a small slip knot. It shouldn't affect the measurement too much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that you have your weight to length measurement, you should be able to compare it to other known yarns and get an idea of what the &quot;weight&quot; group is.

If you pair a slippery yarn with a smooth knitting needle, it will be harder to keep the stitches from sliding away from you. You'll likely have to grip your work harder to keep it in place and that will slow you down. On the other hand, if you pair a rough yarn with a rough knitting needle, it can be hard to move the stitches at all. Extra effort to move the knitting along the needle will also slow you down." />

I'm not sure they would work the same for your purposes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I did locate one recipe specifically for gilding from an SCA member's website:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - 1 part sugar water (the sticky part that allows the gold to adhere)&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - 4 parts liquitex acrylic gesso (adds the bulk to your gesso)&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - 5 parts liquitex gloss varnish medium (keeps the gesso together,    hardening with a smooth finish)&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Color to suit (red for work with gold and blue for silver)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It goes on to give instructions for the gilding process as well, including how to use the gesso:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Lay the Gesso** – Start your area of gesso in the middle of your design&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and pull it outwards towards the edges*.  It is ideal to let this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; gesso dry for 6-8 hours. DO NOT to get air bubbles in your gesso when&#xD;&#xA;&gt; you stir. Gently fold your gesso to remix it.  If you do have air&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bubbles in your laid gesso there will be pits in the surface after it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dries.  To remove the bubbles from gesso that you’ve just laid take a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pin and gently pop them before it begins to dry.  It has been my&#xD;&#xA;&gt; experience that the key to beautiful raised gilding is an even surface&#xD;&#xA;&gt; tension to the &quot;bubble&quot; of gesso that you lay down.  To create an even&#xD;&#xA;&gt; surface tension to your gesso you should first drop a large puddle of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the gesso into the space you will be gilding, then using your brush&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pull the edges of the puddle outwards to the fill your designed space.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This gesso is not designed for flat gilding and your design should be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; filled in with puddles of the gesso that create small domes on your&#xD;&#xA;&gt; page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(source: [The Scribal Art of Elizabth de Nevell][1])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://home.insightbb.com/~denevell_books/gilding.htm" />

Vertically displayed paper has a tendency to curl more in my experience, especially when it has no support. &#xD;&#xA; 2. The gum/glue itself may be causing or aggravating the curling. Some adhesives and coatings draw, or shrink inward, as they dry. (You see this in nail polish, too, when some thicker top coats cause the color to pull away from the tips.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To counteract the curling, you could try a few things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Coat both sides of the paper with the gum/glue, or a varnish. The drawing affect would be lessened as it would be trying to curl in both directions at once.&#xD;&#xA; - Tape the paper down while working and allow to dry thoroughly, leaving it overnight to 'cure' before removing the tape.&#xD;&#xA; - Add a stiffer material as a backing. Thin sheets of metal or wood would be the most stable. But, chipboard or even a heavy cardstock would afford some further support." />

Using a craft knife or something similar would most certainly be the go-to tool. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to try to do the cutting in one motion - to not lift the blade from the paper and, if possible, not change the pressure you are exerting on the scissors. So if you were cutting this on a mat (without scissors of course), when you need to change direction you can rotate the paper accordingly. Craft knives have fine points so turning it is not likely to damage too much. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of the specific Y, using a craft knife, I would also consider the starting point of the cuts to be the intersection shown and then cut away from that point. That approach is more case-by-case and really is dependent on your overall design. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you insist on using scissors, the only tip I have to offer is to try and keep cutting as you are turning the paper. Try and finish the whole cut in one motion of the scissors. That would help stop the start of a tear. Hands and the tool itself can make that hard." />

This answer would hold outside of that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While you can usually epoxy over almost anything if you already have a varnished surface you might not need to bother. &quot;Varnish&quot; a little vague so it would be hard to be exactly sure. I would like to think the artist is aware of this so it should not be an issue. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think one of the better choices here would be epoxy resin. You could also call it a bar-top finish. They are essentially the same thing. I had some initial hesitation in offering this suggestion until I saw multiple artists used epoxy resin to give a glass finish to their own acrylic paintings. ([One such example][1])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They are meant for strength and longevity. However they are more susceptible to sunlight and UV rays then other finishes. You see this in other crafts as well like [penny tables][2]. Epoxy resin is usually food safe once fully cured check your individual product information to be sure. . &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__If you have never done this before this should not be your first large project with epoxy resin__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You need to work in an area that would be relatively free of dust and debris. Epoxies come as two liquids that need to be mixed together: a resin and a hardener. Most require a mix of 1:1.  Hard to say exactly how much you would need to cover your entire surface.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you can remove the legs off your table I would do that and then use some small blocks or other objects to prop the table off the ground. Epoxy resin is self leveling so _it is imperative_ that you ensure your table is level before application. Use a level or series of level to help ensure that. At the same time you need to put down something under the table so that the resin has something to drip onto. This is supposed to happen to ensure an even finish. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mix/stir your epoxy resin and pour over the table. You can use a brush to help the resin get around the whole surface. You are not &quot;painting&quot; the surface but helping the resin get complete coverage. Again, it will drip over the edges and that is fine as it helps coat the edges. You have a few minutes so if you need to add more resin to your surface you have a small window to add more without harming it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bubbles are bound to happen so have a blow torch or heat gun handy to help pop them before the resin starts to cure. I even heard breathing (not blowing) on them helps them pop. This can especially be an issue for a mixed media table as there will be plenty of places for air to hide. Make sure that whatever you are using that you don't want near surface contact and stay in motion. You don't want to burn it or cause wrinkles if the epoxy is starting to cure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can sometimes thin your epoxy to give it a longer curing time which both allows it to seep better and gives you more time. Note this can affect its overall strength. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have your surface coated and bubbles removed then you typically would leave it to cure over a couple of days to be sure. If you have the means to tent the table this will help keep dust off. Be sure whatever you do that there is no risk of the blankets or what not falling onto the table.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Epoxy resins can be a complex subject if you want them to be. There is a lot of scenarios that would be too hard to cover hear. Do you research and always pay attention to product labels. So, if you are curious about this I would recommend reading up on it more. If you wanted to explore this in more detail I would recommend asking specific questions about your particular quandary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Art-Resin has some starting videos on the subject.][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPEbPgE7RGAS&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=penny%20table&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.artresin.com/pages/how-to-videos&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Text="You can use an artist's bridge as well. It's basically a long metal ruler with either rubber feet at either end or a thin foam on the bottom. You can easily make your own out of a sturdy ruler as well. These are used by illustrators but could be useful to the fine artist as well. Here are some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1] [![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bridge is great for horizontal work but for easel work you can take a page from Salvador Dali's playbook and use a [mahl stick][3]. A stick with a ball of leather or rubber is a mahl stick. For the right-hander, the stick is held in the left, the ball is placed at upper right, either on the work surface or edge of easel. Some artists use a leather thong or nail to secure. You now have a movable bridge to keep your hand off the work surface. I use a yardstick with a ball of rags and tape at one end. You can easily make different lengths based on the scale you work at. Side note: see John Cusack demonstrate the use of a mini mahl stick in &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. Try a wooden dowel with a tennis ball or solid rubber ball at the end.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, there is the issue of oils on the hand. To battle this use thin cotton gloves to handle paper. You used to be able to get these at photo supply stores. Cut all fingers off but the pinky for drawing hand. Again, this really just depends on how much you care about preservation of the white of the paper. For illustrators this is huge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I add the following for thoroughness and the OCD tendencies in some of us. Use [frisket film][4] to protect areas you want crisp and white. I've used this for charcoal and the effect is quite profound. Sharp crisp edges, perfect, immaculate whites contrasted with loose charcoal painting and drawing is almost magical. Tedious? yes ....worth it? I leave that as an exercise for the reader.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For simplicity and ease of use, the extra piece of paper suggestions are great. Just adding my 2 cents for completeness. May I just add that tracing paper is great for this due to its lack of tooth and slippery surface.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/P9lun.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PNy0hm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://painting.about.com/od/artglossarym/g/defmahlstick.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisket" />

It was a ***very*** tight bonding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The closest I've found to that, and probably your best bet if you don't mind buying it, is [Plastruct Plastic Weld][1].

Plus: better a nicely finished 'easy' project and the feeling that you succeeded, than a complex ball of paper and you giving up completely, don't you think?&#xD;&#xA; - Larger paper makes things easier to see and to fold. I know dollar bills come in only one size, so you'll need to cut your own piece of paper. Make sure the proportions match.&#xD;&#xA; - If you insist on folding the complex item, try to figure out till which point you still understand the steps; you must absolutely be sure whether folds go up or down, or maybe between two parts of the paper.

This can also reduce your control of the cut. I am in favour of moving both the work and your hand at the same time. I find this makes the motions easier and they take less time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Should I hold the knife vertically or diagonally on the paper?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the cut would naturally be at a slight angle with what I am describing, I would try to avoid doing so and try to cut as vertically as possible. Cutting on a diagonal can weaken the edges of the cuts making more susceptible to damage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is definitely important to try and do the cut in one pass. Hesitation or multiple cuts can create nibs or stray fibers. This is fixable of course but you have to remove more material which can affect the shape. However if done right corrections like that can be hidden as most people won't notice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Should I apply pressure or not?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not sure of the best answer to this other than not too much. You want the knife to do the work. As long as your tool is sharp you should not have to put too much force into it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ACxj.jpg" />

The manufacturer isn't just saying that because they want you to buy a toaster oven -- putting it in the microwave will result in burning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Because microwaves don’t heat evenly, parts of the mass will begin to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cure and harden while others remain soft. Microwave ovens heat the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; inside of clay just as much as the outside, so as the cooking&#xD;&#xA;&gt; continues, parts of the mass will begin to superheat, melt, and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; actually bubble and boil while other parts of the polymer clay mass&#xD;&#xA;&gt; will merely begin to harden.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *&lt;sub&gt;Source: [Can you Bake Polymer Clay in the Microwave?][1]&lt;/sub&gt;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not only will that ruin the project, it releases fumes which at best smell terrible, and at worst can cause respiratory distress and damage. For health and safety reasons, you shouldn't microwave polymer clay on its own.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some crafters do say you can microwave polymer clay as long as it is completely submerged in water. Basically, this is boiling the item to heat it and cure it, but in a microwave rather than on a stovetop.  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Sources: [\[1\]][2] [\[2\]][3]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, some crafters say you still shouldn't -- the quality of the final piece will suffer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Some people advocate using a microwave to boil water which contains&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the polymer clay. The problem with this is that ... boiling water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; never heats above 212°F (100°C) ... [below] the proper curing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; temperatures of most brands of polymer clay. While you may find that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the item is hard after boiling, it will be incompletely cured and will&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be weak and easily broken. (This is true for stove-top curing as&#xD;&#xA;&gt; well.) Some brands of polymer clay will get an icky white residue when&#xD;&#xA;&gt; boiled...

Always start and end the score off the glass and avoid hesitation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Break the glass&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have a good score line you should be able to break the glass with ease. These are general approaches&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- __Score away from the edge of the glass__: Most cuts you should be able to do with your hand as long as there is room. Place your thumbs close on both sides of the score line. Start applying leverage like you want to bend it in half. Much in the same way you break a chocolate bar. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- __Score near the edge__: If you are having issues getting a hold with your hand then you can use glass pliers or running pliers. Basically pliers with curved jaws with a rubber like covering to protect the glass. The curved jaws work the glass the same as you hands and using the score line like a fulcrum. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Running Pliers on glass][3]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [freepatternsforstainedglass.com][4]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other variations of hand and tool positions exist. Its a matter of applying pressure close to the score line to encourage a break. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are having issues getting the break to start you might not have a good score line, glass might be thick as you might need to exert more pressure to start the break. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can use the ball of the cutter to tap near the score line _on the other side_. Run the ball at the edge of the glass and follow the score line along. You likely can see the glass start to break when it gets easier to see. Once that is done you can come back to hands or pliers and try to break again. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you score is weak _do not_ try to score on the same line again. It can damage the tool and will create an unpredictable breaking score line. Instead try scoring again on the other side of the glass. While this still could have problems it is a better 2nd chance approach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of several good videos that covers this and similar topic &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Video][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also [listen to the sound the glass makes when scoring properly][6]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/DwT5Fm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.amazon.ca/Red-Devil-106370-Glass-Cutter/dp/B00004YNNP&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/TOtc6m.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.freepatternsforstainedglass.com/running-pliers.html&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAlrlFyEAt4&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAlrlFyEAt4&amp;t=4m29s" />

This means you can form points, lines, and a variety of other erasing surfaces with it. This allows you to easily erase just the place you want. &#xA;&#xA;Additionally, it doesn't erase the same way as your rubber or Mars plastic (polymer) erasers, which leave bits behind and may wear down you paper. It actually lifts up your graphite or charcoal marks. This means you don't have to brush or blow the residue away. &#xA;&#xA;This property also allows you to only partially erase something. For instance, you may have placed a large swath of grey that's a couple shades too dark. You can pat at the dark area to lighten) it, instead of erasing it and starting over. &#xA;&#xA;I have tried and own eraser shields, but they don't work very well with erasers that have lost their edges. When I do use them, it's with my kneaded erasers and not my polymer erasers. In that case, they work very well as stencils for the point you knead. &#xA;&#xA;As for the points, you need to roll them thick and shallow instead of thin and steep, in order to have enough strength in the tip to hold up. I generally just make a ball, pinch part, and make a cone out of it. &#xA;&#xA;Unless you want to erase very finely, such as adding highlights to hair. In that case, you can leave the point long and thin, and it will gently lift up fine lines of pencil. &#xA;&#xA;Once you start using kneaded erasers, you'll find that they're really an entirely new implement, quite unlike regular erasers. Since you can adjust the amount you erase by changing pressure and eraser shape and even the *way* you apply pressure (standard erasing motion, patting, rolling, stippling!), you can get very fine control over what you're doing. &#xA;&#xA;And you don't have to worry about erasing holes in your paper! &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Now, to be fair, kneaded erasers have downsides. The harder your lead (4H and up), the less effective I find these. Likewise, the harder you press with your pencil, the less effective they are, because they can't pick up the graphite dust. &#xA;&#xA;If the kneaded eraser won't do it, use a polymer eraser (I throw out rubber erasers). You can always use a craft knife to &quot;sharpen&quot; them into a point or chisel. Sharpening polymer erasers makes them work much better with eraser shields, too! &#xA;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneaded_eraser" />

Can I still use it for dip pens if I squeeze it out of the cartridges? ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First off, a syringe typically works best for extracting or injecting inks into cartridges than squeezing. It's extraordinarily easy to buy blunt-needled syringes these days (walmart.com lists a set of four for &amp;lt;$3) because they're used by folks who want to refill their inkjet printer cartridges.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fountain pen inks are *always* water-soluble dyes. This is to make sure that you can always unclog a fountain pen by simply soaking or rinsing with water.  The vast majority of fountain pen inks actually use the same commercial dyes that are used on cloth—I think only a handful of brands mix their own (J. Herbin, Noodlers, Private Reserve). So, you could probably just leave the ink uncovered for a while to get some of the water to evaporate which will concentrate the dye. But it won't get any more viscous or less transparent, because it's water based.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, some fountain pen inks (such as Private Reserve) are known to be harbingers of fungus. So if the ink that came out of the cartridge was sludgy or gel-like, rather than liquid, dump it. It's more trouble than it's worth at that point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dip pen nibs, unlike fountain pens, have no hard-to-reach areas, and being metal are safe to use with solvents, so opaque pigment-based inks like india ink can be used with them." />

Much of what is covered here applies to curves as well, however, I will only focus on cutting straight lines. This is one such cutter:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [![Simple hand held cutter][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [Amazon.com][2]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most basic and versatile tool for cutting glass is the glass cutter. There are different styles and features, but all will have a cutting wheel. There are different grips, ones with multiple rotating cutters and many have a ball or similar on the opposite end of the tool (Which is used for tapping the glass)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Prepping your work surface&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should, in general, be cutting glass on a hard surface that is clean of debris. While you might be tempted to cut on carpet or softer surface, this would be counter productive. The pressure you exert with the tool on the glass is the most important factor, so you don't want the glass to move at all unless by your own hand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The tool, when used properly, will come into contact with this surface so if you have something hard like a metal top, then you might want to put something down like thin cardboard or a self healing mat so as to not damage your cutter prematurely. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Clean glass debris between your breaks. It does not take much to scratch. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Scoring the glass&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Glass cutting with hand tools relies on scoring the glass. You are placing a shallow cut/fissure into the glass to guide the eventual break. Getting the perfect score _can_ be difficult to get perfect, but following some basic guidelines, it can be done. If your tool is not self lubricating then you should make sure you lubricate the wheel. This will prevent it from getting locked up with glass shards and binding. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You want the score to be deep enough that it cuts into the glass but not so deep that it starts throwing off chips. The sound the glass is making while your a cutting is important. [It should sound like a light zipper][6] and the sound should be continuous from the start to the finish of the cut. Always start and end the score off the glass and avoid hesitation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Break the glass&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have a good score line you should be able to break the glass with ease. These are general approaches&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- __Score away from the edge of the glass__: Most cuts you should be able to do with your hand as long as there is room. Place your thumbs close on both sides of the score line. Start applying leverage like you want to bend it in half. Much in the same way you break a chocolate bar. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- __Score near the edge__: If you are having issues getting a hold with your hand then you can use glass pliers or running pliers. Basically pliers with curved jaws with a rubber-like covering to protect the glass. The curved jaws work the glass the same as your hands, using the score line like a fulcrum. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Running Pliers on glass][3]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [freepatternsforstainedglass.com][4]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other variations of hand and tool positions exist. It's a matter of applying pressure close to the score line to encourage a break. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are having issues getting the break to start you might not have a good score line, the glass might be thick, or you might need to exert more pressure to start the break. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can use the ball of the cutter to tap near the score line _on the other side_. Run the ball at the edge of the glass and follow the score line along. You likely can see the glass start to break when it gets easier to see. Once that is done you can come back to hands or pliers and try to break again. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your score is weak _do not_ try to score on the same line again. It can damage the tool and will create an unpredictable breaking score line. Instead try scoring again on the other side of the glass. While this still could have problems, it is a better 2nd chance approach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of several good videos that covers this and similar topic &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Video][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also [listen to the sound the glass makes when scoring properly][6]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/DwT5Fm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.amazon.ca/Red-Devil-106370-Glass-Cutter/dp/B00004YNNP&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/TOtc6m.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.freepatternsforstainedglass.com/running-pliers.html&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAlrlFyEAt4&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAlrlFyEAt4&amp;t=4m29s" />

This means you can form points, lines, and a variety of other erasing surfaces with it. This allows you to easily erase just the place you want. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, it doesn't erase the same way as your rubber or Mars plastic (polymer) erasers, which leave bits behind and may wear down you paper. It actually lifts up your graphite or charcoal marks. This means you don't have to brush or blow the residue away. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This property also allows you to only partially erase something. For instance, you may have placed a large swath of grey that's a couple shades too dark. You can pat at the dark area to lighten it, instead of erasing it and starting over. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have tried and own eraser shields, but they don't work very well with erasers that have lost their edges. When I do use them, it's with my kneaded erasers and not my polymer erasers. In that case, they work very well as stencils for the point you knead. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the points, you need to roll them thick and shallow instead of thin and steep, in order to have enough strength in the tip to hold up. I generally just make a ball, pinch part, and make a cone out of it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unless you want to erase very finely, such as adding highlights to hair. In that case, you can leave the point long and thin, and it will gently lift up fine lines of pencil. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you start using kneaded erasers, you'll find that they're really an entirely new implement, quite unlike regular erasers. Since you can adjust the amount you erase by changing pressure and eraser shape and even the *way* you apply pressure (standard erasing motion, patting, rolling, stippling!), you can get very fine control over what you're doing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And you don't have to worry about erasing holes in your paper! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, to be fair, kneaded erasers have downsides. The harder your lead (4H and up), the less effective I find these. Likewise, the harder you press with your pencil, the less effective they are, because they can't pick up the graphite dust. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the kneaded eraser won't do it, use a polymer eraser (I throw out rubber erasers). You can always use a craft knife to &quot;sharpen&quot; them into a point or chisel. Sharpening polymer erasers makes them work much better with eraser shields, too! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneaded_eraser" />

There are several ways to refer to yarn weight, but the category, the number of plies, the number of wraps per inch and the gauge range (for both knitting and crocheting) are the most commonly used. The weight of your yarn will affect the size of your finished product, and the size of the needles or hook you will have the most ease to work with. You will always it on your skein package.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Yarn label featuring category and gauge range][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are 8 categories of yarn as defined by the [Craft Yarn Council][2]: Lace, Super Fine, Fine, Light, Medium, Bulky, Super Bulky and Jumbo. Each category refers to a specific range of the measurements methods. Some categories will sometimes be substituted for a type of yarn, like Worsted for Medium or DK (Double Knitting) for Light.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The number of plies is nowadays probably the least consistent way to talk about yarn weight. Back in the day when knitting was done with actual sheep wool, yarn was measured by the number of single wool yarns in the finished yarn, but with synthetic yarn, it's more difficult to be consistent. For example, a 5 ply yarn in Australia will be called a 6 ply yarn in Germany, but not be standardized in the UK. Yarns below 5 ply are generally pretty consistent though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wraps per inch (wpi) is the the number of times you can fit a yarn within an inch. The thicker the yarn is, the lower its wpi will be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The gauge range is the number of stitches you can make in a 4 inch or 10 centimeter swatch. This measurement is always double, once for knitting and once for crocheting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a table I made:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Yarn weight table][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/LouGj.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.craftyarncouncil.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/uJEQp.png" />

Some sites don't seem to be bothered by fraying and recommend simply cutting the strings off afterwards but this seems like a great way to get your fabric tied up in knots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One [guide notes][1] to consider the weave tightness:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;First, remember that fabrics will fray depending on how tightly they are woven.  Loosely woven fabrics like Linen and some cottons can fray a 1/2 inch or so.  But some cottons and polyesters with a tighter weave might only frizz out on the ends.  And knit fabrics won’t fray at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other common notes are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - wash the fabric in large pieces rather than small ones as the small pieces can be sucked into the machine's agitator &#xD;&#xA; - wash the fabric in the same method you plan to wash the garment - so (as an example) if you're planning to dry clean your wool, dry clean the fabric rather than machine washing it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a note, with all methods, your results may vary. This quilting site has a forum with a [topic][2] where many quilters are discussing preventing fraying and the results are mixed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Different methods mentioned include clipping the corners, using pinking shears, sewing/serging, and simply not doing anything at all because fraying is inevitable... so the top suggestion is to always make sure you have extra fabric to allow for losing an inch or two to fraying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few of the comments I thought seemed helpful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**auntpiggylpn**: I also tried the &quot;Clip the Corners&quot; method and my fabrics still frayed, didn't seem to be any less or more than if I did nothing to the edges. This was also LQS type fabric. I tried the pinking shears trick and it didn't stop the fraying. I've also sewed along the edges prior to washing but it still frayed. Some fabrics don't fray at all and then some others I will loose at least an inch off the total cut. I ALWAYS was in cold on a delicate cycle and only put in the dryer until damp them iron. sorry, I don't have any positive answers for you!! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**MaryAnnMc**: I agree, everything I've tried still frays. But I've decided to stick with pinking: it does cut down on the fraying considerably, and I can always tell which fabrics in my stash have been washed. that alone is a good reason. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**M.I.Late**:I also just let it fray and just rip off the threads. When I wash fabric, I open it all the way up. I find that some manufacturers don't get it rolled on the bolt completely straight. So, I open it up completely, wash and dry it, refold it so there are no diagonal waves when held selvage to selvage, (I usually lose 1-2 inches here - but it has been as much as 3.) Then I trim it with the rotary cutter and iron it and it gets either used then or stashed for future use. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**bearisgray**: I finally learned to either serge the raw edge or overcast the raw edge with a long, narrow zigzag stitch before washing. I lose - at the most - about 1/8 inch of fabric when I zigzag the edges - none when I overcast if I remove the stitching.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.madeeveryday.com/2012/05/ask-dana-prewashing-fabrics-and-overwhelmed-with-projects.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.quiltingboard.com/main-f1/prewashing-fraying-t140851.html" />

The initial “screen” of hatching may be overlaid with subsequent series of lines drawn at contrasting angles, creating crosshatching&#xD;&#xA;and further darkening the value of the area.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;... as well as what they can be used for in art:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The basic illusion of hatching is that a sequence of separate lines will read as a solid value from a slight distance. With hachure a draftsman can evoke a middle tone, a core or cast shadow or the atmosphere around a figure, as well as provide a means by which disparate elements of a drawing are unified.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Objectives, techniques, and variations&#xD;&#xA;-&#xD;&#xA;[This online tutorial](http://thevirtualinstructor.com/hatchingcrosshatching.html) with pictures and videos tells you some of the basic techniques and variations of the art of hatching and cross-hatching. I'll provide some of the most useful quotes for introductory guidance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Hatching**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; Hatching is created when non-crossing lines are used to indicate the value on or around an object. The value added to the object is dependent on the location of a light source. **More marks are added in the areas of core shadow and cast shadow, while less marks should exist in lighter areas.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; When hatching is used, **the lines drawn generally go in the same direction and are mostly parallel with each other**. Sometimes, the lines may curve slightly or even a great bit depending on the contours of the object. Lines of this nature are referred to as cross contour lines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; When used correctly, cross contour lines can further the illusion of form by giving the viewer information about the actual 3-dimensional qualities of the object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; By changing the frequency of the use of line, and the amount of space between the lines, the artist can create a full range of value in the drawing. Assuming that an artist is working on white paper, **more space between the lines (more paper showing) will lead to lighter values in the drawing. Less space between lines will naturally lead to darker values in the drawing.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Cross hatching**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; When cross hatching is used, the artist may begin adding value as hatching, but then allow the lines to cross over each other. **The more that the lines cross over each other, the darker the value becomes.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; Many artists approach the addition of crossing lines as a science, following a **specific order of vertical lines, followed by horizontal lines, followed by diagonal lines, and so on.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; **This method produces very deliberate and controlled marks that are very exact and precise. Others simply cross the lines at random leading to “looser” drawings.** Neither way is better, per se. Some looser approaches work better for some subjects, while more rigid approaches are suitable for other subjects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a more visual way of learning how to do hatching and cross-hatching, there are various tutorial videos online. Here's one using a calligraphic pen and ink:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHoqh27vQRw&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And another one using a pencil:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxZwO_tIpns" />

Many artists share that opinion, but it's opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The proper way depends on you, but the reason for knife sharpening of pencils is so that you're able to expose more lead at once to facilitate different shading techniques and to minimize lead wastage from standard sharpeners.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, for colored pencils, many just use really good classic hand sharpeners. This is because many of them are quite fragile and would break too easily if too much of the lead was exposed. Prismacolors, which are very popular, break very easily and so you generally want less of the lead exposed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the to;dr response to your question is: no, but many do based on their techniques." />

This makes the next step easier. &#xD;&#xA; 2. Use a single strand of yarn and tie it around the loops. You can place it in-between the fork tines in order to get around the yarn loops.

I wrote that original comment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I sharpen my drawing pencils the &quot;proper&quot; way, with a knife.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was intending to be tongue-in-cheek, because you may find a lot of comments or tutorials online insisting that this is *the* right way to sharpen a pencil. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think that it's the case, but I've now written a little tutorial about the &quot;proper&quot; way to sharpen a pencil, and also some pointers about sharpening pencils in general. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Why use a knife?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using a knife to sharpen your pencil allows you to control the length and the shape of the exposed core. This, then, gives you more control over the types of strokes you'll be able to make. Longer points mean you can lay down wider lines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A knife is very helpful for sharpening graphite, charcoal, and pastel pencils. These types of materials hold up to the process better, and wider lines are more likely to be sought from them. As [John Cavan][1] pointed out, colored pencils don't really hold up to the process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What you'll need:&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- A sandpaper pad or block &#xD;&#xA;- A pencil&#xD;&#xA;- A very sharp knife&#xD;&#xA;- A quick way to get rid of the shavings&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The knife needs to be very sharp, because you don't want to apply much pressure to the pencil at all. The more pressure you have to apply, the more likely you are to break the exposed core *or* cause internal stress fractures that don't show up until much later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the knife is very sharp, please be careful. I prefer to use a utility knife, as shown, because the blades are sharp and easily replaceable when dull. I have used pocket knives before, but sharpening them is a whole other process. If you've never used a utility knife before, be aware that they generally come with spare blades inside them, so you don't have to buy extras right away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you've only just started sharpening pencils this way, **please use cheap pencils**. It's very common to break pencils until you get the hang of this. Practice the technique on something you're fine with throwing away. That said, be aware that some cheaper pencils use really cheap wood, which may be harder or more prone to splitting. You generally won't have that problem with actual art pencils.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I usually sharpen directly over a small trash can, but today I'm doing it over some scrap paper I can just pick up and shake out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##1. Starting&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Always hold the knife with the blade facing away from you. If you're concerned about the shavings flying into your eye, wear safety goggles.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hold the knife at about a 90 degree angle to your pencil. With the hand holding the pencil, put your thumb against the back of the blade and apply a slight pressure. You will start sharpening by pushing against the knife with your thumb, but **holding the knife completely still**. The hand with the pencil will do all the work, adjusting the speed and pressure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do shallow but long strokes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4][![enter image description here][5]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should end up with plenty of shavings, as you can see. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##2. Refining the tip&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you start to expose the core, be careful not to nick it. At first you'll start with only a small bit exposed, but then slowly work your way to exposing the full length you want. Make sure you're not just taking wood off the very front, but going back further up the pencil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][6]][6][![enter image description here][7]][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As picture above, I started by exposing only a small amount, but then shaved portions away from the entire tip to have more lead exposed. If you only work towards the front, the cone of the wood will be too short and increase the likelihood of breakage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once I have what I feel is about the correct length, I test the angle of the wood against a flat surface.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][8]][8]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If I can't get the wood flush with the surface, that's no good. The purpose of this type of sharpening is to allow for strokes using the full flat of the lead. If the wood is curved inwards (as seen above) or too short, then trying to use the flat may cause breakage. If the slope doesn't flow well into your actual core, then trying to lay the flat of the pencil down may only yield strokes with part of the tip.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wasn't happy with my slope, so I worked at it some more. At this point, I do small, quick shavings while rotating the pencil. I'll do this by using the knife to do the work, instead of pushing with my thumb, as it's much faster. However, I've practiced on a bunch of pencils and I'm confident I won't gouge my wood or break the lead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I ended up with a much smoother slope. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][9]][9]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##3. Perfecting the point&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you may have noticed, my point is still blunt! You don't need to sharpen that with the knife, as that's where the sanding pad comes in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][10]][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hold the pencil between your thumb and two fingers and roll it so that pencil rotates. You'll do this while rubbing the lead point along the sandpaper. Make steady, even strokes. Like before, **only the pencil should move**, and not the sandpaper. As you roll the pencil, the goal is to get a full 360 degree rotation, or close, in one full stroke.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason for this rotation is that it keeps the point centered in the core and keeps it conical. If you don't rotate enough, you may end up with more of a wedge or oblong shape. Those can be quite useful, if it's your goal, but generally you don't want those other shapes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also sharpen the point by sanding with your strokes following the length of the pencil, instead of perpendicular to the pencil. (I think of it as &quot;up and down&quot; instead of &quot;side to side&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][11]][11]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This lets you more easily match the point to the slope of the wood, if that's you're intent. You still need to rotate the pencil as you do this. I spent time making my slope nice, so I used a combination of strokes to get the point to match.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the end, I made a nice, long point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][12]][12]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you practice, you may end up making short or longer points, depending on your preference (or skill). The longer the point, the wider the strokes you can make, but also the more likely you are to have breaks while sharpening, using or storing your pencils.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##4. Clean up&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your sandpaper pad may look pretty grim after this. But if you bang it on your table or inside your bin, a fair amount of dust will come off. You can use one sheet for a considerable number of pencils, so don't throw it away too soon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][13]][13]  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Before&lt;/sub&gt;  &#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][14]][14]  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;After&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, **before actually using the pencil, you need to clean it off**, too. I typically make a bunch of test strokes, and even rub just the wooden part on the paper. A lot of the dust from your core will laying on the surface, and if you don't wipe it off you may end up laying down some accidental, very dark lines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can use a cloth for this, but I usually just use scratch paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][15]][15]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##The proper way, in general&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The keys to a sharp pencil, without breakage, are generally the same whether you're using a knife or a hand sharpener:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Have a sharp blade&#xD;&#xA; 2. Move the pencil, not the blade&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have a handful of sharpeners just like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][16]][16]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They work great for me. I just keep it steady in my offhand, and turn the pencil with my other. The blades are replaceable, but I have so many sharpeners that I haven't had to do that, yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, I only sharpen one set of by 9B - 9H range of pencils with a knife, and the rest get the hand sharpener treatment. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I avoid electric sharpeners for anything but writing pencils. They violate one of my guidelines, because the blade moves and not the pencil, so I already distrust them. Something about the process seems to increase the chance that the lead cracks internally, and I just end up sharpening them over and over.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They also get gummed up by colored pencils. Some companies make electric sharpeners just for colored pencils, but I haven't tried them so I can't comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/458/24&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/sLbxHm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/l291hm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dpzrxm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/o5qhym.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/bwIoLm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/jga5Im.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/7len7.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/USIPY.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/uwCAvm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/mbgqmm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/aSqZam.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NDhVam.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/uX7SOm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/CUYKwm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [16]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/73RVjm.jpg" />

Printer and notebook paper have very little **tooth** (roughness); lack **weight** (i.e., the sheets are thin); and have relatively high acid content, which means they will yellow and become brittle over time.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#The main differences:  Tooth and Weight&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Weight:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Weight&quot; is basically (as the term implies) a measure of how thick and heavy each sheet of paper is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Thicker or heavier papers can handle more water or paint without buckling, curling or falling apart. Traditionally, papers are measured by the weight in pounds of one ream, approximately 500 sheets. If a paper comes in different sizes, its weight will vary even though the thickness has not changed. Each paper type uses a certain size as its &quot;standard.&quot; A ream of standard 22&quot; x 30&quot; watercolor paper (500 sheets) would weigh 300 lbs. The very same thickness paper in a 40&quot; x 60&quot; sheet would have a weight of 1,114 lbs. for the ream of paper. Its weight changed due to the size of the sheets, not the paper's thickness, but the paper is still designated as 300-lb. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The inconsistency of this traditional method has led to the use of metric measurements or grams per square meter or gsm. When paper is measured in gsm, its weight will not change with the size of the sheet. The same 22&quot; x 30&quot; sheet of watercolor paper described above would weigh 640gsm, meaning that a square meter of this paper would weigh 640 grams. Larger size sheets of that same paper, like a 40&quot; x 60&quot; size sheet, also would weigh 640gsm. While different sizes, the square meter remains constant, as does the thickness of the paper.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Weights (relating to thickness) of paper are standardized and defined by the International Organization for Standardization and are often listed in grams per square meter (gsm), or in pounds, the standard of measurement more familiar to most artists in the U.S.  Following are some of the most common weights of paper found in sketchbooks and drawing pads (all measurements are approximate):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;25 lb (approx 40 gsm):  tracing paper  &#xD;&#xA;30-35 lb (approx 45-50 gsm):  newsprint  &#xD;&#xA;50-60 lb (approx 75-90 gsm):  sketching or practice paper — thick enough to work on with pencils, charcoal, or pastels, but usually too thin for ink or most markers, which may bleed through.  &#xD;&#xA;70-80 lb (approx 100-130 gsm): drawing paper suitable for finished artwork in most media.  Paper any lighter than 70lb will usually be thin enough to see through to drawings or materials underneath.  &#xD;&#xA;90-110 lb (approx 180-260 gsm):  heavy-weight drawing paper, bristol, multi-media papers.  Weight in this range is similar to card stock or light poster board.   &#xD;&#xA;Heavier papers, up to 140 lb (approx 300 gsm) or more, are most often used for painting rather than drawing.  When found in sketchbooks, they are usually rougher papers intended as watercolor journals or to remove for painting on individual sheets.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Tooth:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Tooth&quot; is a measure of how rough or smooth the paper's surface texture is.  The more tooth a paper has, the rougher it is, and the better it will take soft art media like charcoal and pastels.  The less tooth it has, the smoother it is, and the better it will be for fine detail work, harder graphite, pen and ink, etc.  Wet media (ink, watercolors, etc) will be more likely to bleed on a toothier paper;  dry media (charcoal, pastels, etc) will be more likely to slough off of a paper with less tooth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Surfaces are described as having more or less “tooth,” or roughness in texture. The more toothy the paper, the rougher its surface. Rougher surfaces are generally found more in thicker papers. Thick, toothy surfaces hold on to more of the drawing or painting medium and are better for high contrast and lower detail works. Toothier papers are well suited to charcoal, crayon and pastels, ink washes and watercolor, or any work that utilizes the texture of the paper for aesthetic effect. Smoother surfaces take up less media and are better suited to more detailed work. Very lightweight papers like tissue paper, and lightweight sketch paper are usually smooth, but thicker papers like bristol and some painting paper are also smooth. Smoother surfaces are ideal for graphite pencil, colored pencil, and ink pens. Smoother papers are also more likely to be bleedproof, meaning that ink or color washes won’t spread and “feather” across the surface.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Rough paper is chosen for its definite texture. It is the natural result when a sheet is allowed to air dry without smoothing or pressing. Rough surface paper is a good choice for transparent watercolors used in a bold and immediate style, as it allows the pigment of color washes to settle into the hollows of the paper. Pastel artists also generally prefer a paper with &quot;tooth&quot; or texture to grab onto the pastel pigment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Cold Press paper, which is the most popular and versatile, has a slight texture. Handmade papers achieve this by re-pressing a new wet sheet, which smoothes the surface to some degree. Machine-made papers get a similar effect by placing the wet sheets between cold metal rollers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Not/Cold Press: A &quot;Not&quot; sheet means it is &quot;not hot press,&quot; and the term is often used instead of cold press.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Hot Presspaper is very smooth. It is made by running a freshly formed sheet through heated metal rollers or plates. Much like a clothes iron, this smoothes out any texture left by the earlier stages and creates a flat, hard, featureless surface. A good choice for highly detailed illustrations, it is also used for printmaking, etching, drafting, sketching and drawing.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Secondary coniderations:  Fiber and Sizing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Fiber:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Paper is made from a variety of plant sources. Whether the fibers come from cotton or other plants such as linen, flax, jute, hemp, bamboo, rice straw or rattan, they all provide cellulose fibers or plant cells of varying dimensions. A sheet of paper is basically a thin layer of mingled cellulose fibers. Most commonly, three types of fibers are used to produce papers for drawing and painting: cotton, cellulose and a combination of fibers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cotton papers**, made from the longest cotton fibers, are *generally considered the highest quality*. They are referred to as being 100% cotton rag and *can handle heavy erasing and working without tearing or showing wear*. High-quality 100% cotton paper can last more than 100 years. However, not all cotton papers are the same. Those made from the lesser-quality, shorter cotton fibers can get fuzzy with reworking. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cellulose papers** are usually made of wood pulp and *naturally have an acid content that will destroy the paper over time. The more acidic a paper is, the shorter its life expectancy*. Buffers can be added to make the paper neutral.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Many papers are acid free. This designation means that the paper has a neutral pH (around 7). Acid-free papers should be selected for work intended to last for long periods of time because papers with higher acid content will deteriorate much faster. For most cellulose-based papers, acid-free also means that lignin and sulfur have been removed from the paper. These are the ingredients in wood-based papers that fade ink and turn paper yellow over time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cotton and cotton-rag paper** do not contain cellulose and are naturally acid-free. Cotton-based papers are also stronger, often thicker, hold up better to a lot of erasing, and perform well for wet media such as watercolor or ink washes. Cotton is often blended with cellulose to add strength and durability to paper. Premium archival papers will often list a ratio of cotton and wood fiber.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][3] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Sizing/Absorbency:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Sizing&quot; is an additive that makes the paper more resistant to moisture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Papers intended for wet media (paints or inks) are made with sizing, a starch or gelatin that is either included in the paper pulp during the paper-making process, or is applied to the surface of the paper.  Sizing prevents liquid from absorbing too quickly into the paper, allowing some working time to lift, lighten, or move paints or inks by applying more water.  Sizing also helps protect the paper from getting too soggy, which can result in tearing and wrinkling.  Sizing can also help prevent finer ink or paint lines from spreading and feathering.  Sketchbooks intended for wet media should indicate on the cover that the paper is sized.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sizing is added to make paper more water-resistant. It keeps the paper from absorbing too much moisture or pigment and helps to keep watercolors or inks brilliant. It also keeps lines and edges looking crisp. It is less important for papers used for dry media. Sizing also can factor into a paper's archival qualities - whether it will sustain or deteriorate over time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Internal sizing** is added while the paper pulp is still in a liquid state and is maintained in the matter of the paper. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**External, Surface or Tub sizing** is applied to the surface of the paper after the sheet is formed and dried. Some paper is both internally and surface-sized.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Other considerations:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Binding:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes a matter of mere personal preference, sometimes a matter of necessity, &quot;binding&quot; refers to how - and whether - the sheets of paper are connected to one another:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Hard-bound** sketchbooks have a hard cover and a sewn joint, just like a hard-bound book. These sketchbooks generally contain medium weight paper, about 70 lb. Hard-bound sketchbooks are the toughest and sometimes the expensive. They take more wear and tear, and generally survive longer than spiral or tape-bound books. Depending on the quality and method of binding, hard-bound sketchbooks often do not lay flat when opened all the way, so they can be difficult to use for larger drawings or for writing. Hard-bound sketchbooks are also less likely to have perforated pages, so they’re better thought of as real archival sketchbooks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Spiral-bound** sketchbooks sometimes have hard covers but their covers often consist of a hard back cover and a thick paper front. Because of this construction, spiral-bound books are a little less hardy than hard-bound sketchbooks. Spiral-bound sketchbooks open flat when put on a surface, so they can be good for ink and paint washes. Spiral-bound sketchbooks often have perforated pages, so pages are easy to remove and have a clean edge for presentation, duplication, mounting, or framing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Tape-bound** sketchbooks generally have fewer pages than hard-bound and spiral-bound sketchbooks and do not have substantial covers. Tape-bound sketchbooks are not rugged, long lasting sketchbooks. Sketchbooks bound in this manner come in a wide variety of surface types and weights, ranging from very thin tissue and tracing paper to heavy bristol and vellum papers. Sometimes, tape-bound sketchbook pages are perforated, but often the pages are held in by a line of adhesive so it is not difficult to pull them out.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Single sheets** are a great way to experiment with a limited quantity of paper. They will often require stretching and taping to remain flat if wet media is being used. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Blocks** are a stack of paper glued or bound together on all four sides and mounted on a backing board. A block keeps the paper stretched as you paint. Once the painting is dry, the sheet is removed by inserting a knife between the sheets and gently breaking the binding. Blocks are a good choice for working wet, outdoors or while traveling.

Printer and notebook paper have very little **tooth** (roughness); lack **weight** (i.e., the sheets are thin); and have relatively high acid content, which means they will yellow and become brittle over time.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#The main differences:  Tooth and Weight&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Weight:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Weight&quot; is basically (as the term implies) a measure of how thick and heavy each sheet of paper is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Thicker or heavier papers can handle more water or paint without buckling, curling or falling apart. Traditionally, papers are measured by the weight in pounds of one ream, approximately 500 sheets. If a paper comes in different sizes, its weight will vary even though the thickness has not changed. Each paper type uses a certain size as its &quot;standard.&quot; A ream of standard 22&quot; x 30&quot; watercolor paper (500 sheets) would weigh 300 lbs. The very same thickness paper in a 40&quot; x 60&quot; sheet would have a weight of 1,114 lbs. for the ream of paper. Its weight changed due to the size of the sheets, not the paper's thickness, but the paper is still designated as 300-lb. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The inconsistency of this traditional method has led to the use of metric measurements or grams per square meter or gsm. When paper is measured in gsm, its weight will not change with the size of the sheet. The same 22&quot; x 30&quot; sheet of watercolor paper described above would weigh 640gsm, meaning that a square meter of this paper would weigh 640 grams. Larger size sheets of that same paper, like a 40&quot; x 60&quot; size sheet, also would weigh 640gsm. While different sizes, the square meter remains constant, as does the thickness of the paper.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Weights (relating to thickness) of paper are standardized and defined by the International Organization for Standardization and are often listed in grams per square meter (gsm), or in pounds, the standard of measurement more familiar to most artists in the U.S.  Following are some of the most common weights of paper found in sketchbooks and drawing pads (all measurements are approximate):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;25 lb (approx 40 gsm):  tracing paper  &#xD;&#xA;30-35 lb (approx 45-50 gsm):  newsprint  &#xD;&#xA;50-60 lb (approx 75-90 gsm):  sketching or practice paper — thick enough to work on with pencils, charcoal, or pastels, but usually too thin for ink or most markers, which may bleed through.  &#xD;&#xA;70-80 lb (approx 100-130 gsm): drawing paper suitable for finished artwork in most media.  Paper any lighter than 70lb will usually be thin enough to see through to drawings or materials underneath.  &#xD;&#xA;90-110 lb (approx 180-260 gsm):  heavy-weight drawing paper, bristol, multi-media papers.  Weight in this range is similar to card stock or light poster board.   &#xD;&#xA;Heavier papers, up to 140 lb (approx 300 gsm) or more, are most often used for painting rather than drawing.  When found in sketchbooks, they are usually rougher papers intended as watercolor journals or to remove for painting on individual sheets.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Sketch paper** is the thinnest, lightest paper, varying from 30 to 60 lbs. It isn't meant be used for finished drawings, as most will discolor and degrade quickly. However, it's economical, and perfect for short studies, thumbnails, compositional sketches, and working out ideas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Watercolor or printmaking paper** has to be the thickest, heaviest paper because it must withstand the moisture from the water media applied to it. It usually weighs between 90 and 140 lbs. (The smoother, hot press watercolor papers can be great for drawing, also!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Graphite or charcoal** drawing paper doesn't need the durability of watercolor or printmaking paper, but is heavier than sketch paper. It usually weighs between 70 and 100 lbs. The weight you choose should depend on how you work with your medium.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Drawing Source][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Tooth:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Tooth&quot; is a measure of how rough or smooth the paper's surface texture is.  The more tooth a paper has, the rougher it is, and the better it will take soft art media like charcoal and pastels.  The less tooth it has, the smoother it is, and the better it will be for fine detail work, harder graphite, pen and ink, etc.  Wet media (ink, watercolors, etc) will be more likely to bleed on a toothier paper;  dry media (charcoal, pastels, etc) will be more likely to slough off of a paper with less tooth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Surfaces are described as having more or less “tooth,” or roughness in texture. The more toothy the paper, the rougher its surface. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Rougher surfaces** are generally found more in thicker papers. *Thick, toothy surfaces hold on to more of the drawing or painting medium and are better for high contrast and lower detail works. Toothier papers are well suited to charcoal, crayon and pastels, ink washes and watercolor*, or any work that utilizes the texture of the paper for aesthetic effect. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Smoother surfaces** take up less media and are better suited to more detailed work. Very lightweight papers like tissue paper, and lightweight sketch paper are usually smooth, but thicker papers like bristol and some painting paper are also smooth. *Smoother surfaces are ideal for graphite pencil, colored pencil, and ink pens*. Smoother papers are also more likely to be bleedproof, meaning that ink or color washes won’t spread and “feather” across the surface.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Rough paper** is chosen for its definite texture. It is the natural result when a sheet is allowed to air dry without smoothing or pressing. Rough surface paper is a good choice for transparent watercolors used in a bold and immediate style, as it allows the pigment of color washes to settle into the hollows of the paper. Pastel artists also generally prefer a paper with &quot;tooth&quot; or texture to grab onto the pastel pigment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cold Press paper**, which is the most popular and versatile, has a slight texture. Handmade papers achieve this by re-pressing a new wet sheet, which smoothes the surface to some degree. Machine-made papers get a similar effect by placing the wet sheets between cold metal rollers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Not/Cold Press**: A &quot;Not&quot; sheet means it is &quot;not hot press,&quot; and the term is often used instead of cold press.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Hot Press paper** is very smooth. It is made by running a freshly formed sheet through heated metal rollers or plates. Much like a clothes iron, this smoothes out any texture left by the earlier stages and creates a flat, hard, featureless surface. A good choice for highly detailed illustrations, it is also used for printmaking, etching, drafting, sketching and drawing.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Secondary coniderations:  Fiber and Sizing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Fiber:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Paper is made from a variety of plant sources. Whether the fibers come from cotton or other plants such as linen, flax, jute, hemp, bamboo, rice straw or rattan, they all provide cellulose fibers or plant cells of varying dimensions. A sheet of paper is basically a thin layer of mingled cellulose fibers. Most commonly, three types of fibers are used to produce papers for drawing and painting: cotton, cellulose and a combination of fibers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cotton papers**, made from the longest cotton fibers, are *generally considered the highest quality*. They are referred to as being 100% cotton rag and *can handle heavy erasing and working without tearing or showing wear*. High-quality 100% cotton paper can last more than 100 years. However, not all cotton papers are the same. Those made from the lesser-quality, shorter cotton fibers can get fuzzy with reworking. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cellulose papers** are usually made of wood pulp and *naturally have an acid content that will destroy the paper over time. The more acidic a paper is, the shorter its life expectancy*. Buffers can be added to make the paper neutral.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Many papers are acid free. This designation means that the paper has a neutral pH (around 7). Acid-free papers should be selected for work intended to last for long periods of time because papers with higher acid content will deteriorate much faster. For most cellulose-based papers, acid-free also means that lignin and sulfur have been removed from the paper. These are the ingredients in wood-based papers that fade ink and turn paper yellow over time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cotton and cotton-rag paper** do not contain cellulose and are naturally acid-free. Cotton-based papers are also stronger, often thicker, hold up better to a lot of erasing, and perform well for wet media such as watercolor or ink washes. Cotton is often blended with cellulose to add strength and durability to paper. Premium archival papers will often list a ratio of cotton and wood fiber.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][3] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**pH neutral** means that the paper had a neutral pH (7) at the time that it was made, but may still contain ingredients that can become acidic over time (for example, the size used to seal the paper).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Acid free** means that nothing acidic (and nothing that can become acidic) was introduced to the paper at any point in the paper-making process. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Some manufacturers (such as Strathmore) take further precautions and make paper at a slightly basic pH of 7.2 to 7.5.  This provides an alkaline buffer to help counter anything acidic that it may come into contact with.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Drawing Source][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Sizing/Absorbency:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Sizing&quot; is an additive that makes the paper more resistant to moisture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Papers intended for wet media (paints or inks) are made with sizing, a starch or gelatin that is either included in the paper pulp during the paper-making process, or is applied to the surface of the paper.  Sizing prevents liquid from absorbing too quickly into the paper, allowing some working time to lift, lighten, or move paints or inks by applying more water.  Sizing also helps protect the paper from getting too soggy, which can result in tearing and wrinkling.  Sizing can also help prevent finer ink or paint lines from spreading and feathering.  Sketchbooks intended for wet media should indicate on the cover that the paper is sized.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sizing is added to make paper more water-resistant. It keeps the paper from absorbing too much moisture or pigment and helps to keep watercolors or inks brilliant. It also keeps lines and edges looking crisp. It is less important for papers used for dry media. Sizing also can factor into a paper's archival qualities - whether it will sustain or deteriorate over time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Internal sizing** is added while the paper pulp is still in a liquid state and is maintained in the matter of the paper. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**External, Surface or Tub sizing** is applied to the surface of the paper after the sheet is formed and dried. Some paper is both internally and surface-sized.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Other considerations:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Binding:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes a matter of mere personal preference, sometimes a matter of necessity, &quot;binding&quot; refers to how - and whether - the sheets of paper are connected to one another:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Hard-bound** sketchbooks have a hard cover and a sewn joint, just like a hard-bound book. These sketchbooks generally contain medium weight paper, about 70 lb. Hard-bound sketchbooks are the toughest and sometimes the expensive. They take more wear and tear, and generally survive longer than spiral or tape-bound books. Depending on the quality and method of binding, hard-bound sketchbooks often do not lay flat when opened all the way, so they can be difficult to use for larger drawings or for writing. Hard-bound sketchbooks are also less likely to have perforated pages, so they’re better thought of as real archival sketchbooks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Spiral-bound** sketchbooks sometimes have hard covers but their covers often consist of a hard back cover and a thick paper front. Because of this construction, spiral-bound books are a little less hardy than hard-bound sketchbooks. Spiral-bound sketchbooks open flat when put on a surface, so they can be good for ink and paint washes. Spiral-bound sketchbooks often have perforated pages, so pages are easy to remove and have a clean edge for presentation, duplication, mounting, or framing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Tape-bound** sketchbooks generally have fewer pages than hard-bound and spiral-bound sketchbooks and do not have substantial covers. Tape-bound sketchbooks are not rugged, long lasting sketchbooks. Sketchbooks bound in this manner come in a wide variety of surface types and weights, ranging from very thin tissue and tracing paper to heavy bristol and vellum papers. Sometimes, tape-bound sketchbook pages are perforated, but often the pages are held in by a line of adhesive so it is not difficult to pull them out.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Single sheets** are a great way to experiment with a limited quantity of paper. They will often require stretching and taping to remain flat if wet media is being used. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Blocks** are a stack of paper glued or bound together on all four sides and mounted on a backing board. A block keeps the paper stretched as you paint. Once the painting is dry, the sheet is removed by inserting a knife between the sheets and gently breaking the binding. Blocks are a good choice for working wet, outdoors or while traveling. The disadvantage is that you can only use one sheet at a time.    &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#In practice:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally speaking, rough, thick paper is best suited for charcoals and pastels;  smoother, thinner paper is best suited for graphite and ink.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.dickblick.com/productinfo/learn/paper/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-surfaces-and-weights/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-paper-quality/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.thedrawingsource.com/drawing-paper.html&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-binging-and-perforation/" />

A block keeps the paper stretched as you paint. Once the painting is dry, the sheet is removed by inserting a knife between the sheets and gently breaking the binding.

Printer and notebook paper have very little **tooth** (roughness); lack **weight** (i.e., the sheets are thin); and have relatively high acid content, which means they will yellow and become brittle over time.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Different Kinds of Drawing Paper:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##The main differences:  Tooth and Weight&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Weight:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Weight&quot; is basically (as the term implies) a measure of how thick and heavy each sheet of paper is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Thicker or heavier papers can handle more water or paint without buckling, curling or falling apart. Traditionally, papers are measured by the weight in pounds of one ream, approximately 500 sheets. If a paper comes in different sizes, its weight will vary even though the thickness has not changed. Each paper type uses a certain size as its &quot;standard.&quot; A ream of standard 22&quot; x 30&quot; watercolor paper (500 sheets) would weigh 300 lbs. The very same thickness paper in a 40&quot; x 60&quot; sheet would have a weight of 1,114 lbs. for the ream of paper. Its weight changed due to the size of the sheets, not the paper's thickness, but the paper is still designated as 300-lb. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The inconsistency of this traditional method has led to the use of metric measurements or grams per square meter or gsm. When paper is measured in gsm, its weight will not change with the size of the sheet. The same 22&quot; x 30&quot; sheet of watercolor paper described above would weigh 640gsm, meaning that a square meter of this paper would weigh 640 grams. Larger size sheets of that same paper, like a 40&quot; x 60&quot; size sheet, also would weigh 640gsm. While different sizes, the square meter remains constant, as does the thickness of the paper.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Weights (relating to thickness) of paper are standardized and defined by the International Organization for Standardization and are often listed in grams per square meter (gsm), or in pounds, the standard of measurement more familiar to most artists in the U.S.  Following are some of the most common weights of paper found in sketchbooks and drawing pads (all measurements are approximate):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;25 lb (approx 40 gsm):  tracing paper  &#xD;&#xA;30-35 lb (approx 45-50 gsm):  newsprint  &#xD;&#xA;50-60 lb (approx 75-90 gsm):  sketching or practice paper — thick enough to work on with pencils, charcoal, or pastels, but usually too thin for ink or most markers, which may bleed through.  &#xD;&#xA;70-80 lb (approx 100-130 gsm): drawing paper suitable for finished artwork in most media.  Paper any lighter than 70lb will usually be thin enough to see through to drawings or materials underneath.  &#xD;&#xA;90-110 lb (approx 180-260 gsm):  heavy-weight drawing paper, bristol, multi-media papers.  Weight in this range is similar to card stock or light poster board.   &#xD;&#xA;Heavier papers, up to 140 lb (approx 300 gsm) or more, are most often used for painting rather than drawing.  When found in sketchbooks, they are usually rougher papers intended as watercolor journals or to remove for painting on individual sheets.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Sketch paper** is the thinnest, lightest paper, varying from 30 to 60 lbs. It isn't meant be used for finished drawings, as most will discolor and degrade quickly. However, it's economical, and perfect for short studies, thumbnails, compositional sketches, and working out ideas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Watercolor or printmaking paper** has to be the thickest, heaviest paper because it must withstand the moisture from the water media applied to it. It usually weighs between 90 and 140 lbs. (The smoother, hot press watercolor papers can be great for drawing, also!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Graphite or charcoal** drawing paper doesn't need the durability of watercolor or printmaking paper, but is heavier than sketch paper. It usually weighs between 70 and 100 lbs. The weight you choose should depend on how you work with your medium.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Drawing Source][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Tooth:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Tooth&quot; is a measure of how rough or smooth the paper's surface texture is.  The more tooth a paper has, the rougher it is, and the better it will take soft art media like charcoal and pastels.  The less tooth it has, the smoother it is, and the better it will be for fine detail work, harder graphite, pen and ink, etc.  Wet media (ink, watercolors, etc) will be more likely to bleed on a toothier paper;  dry media (charcoal, pastels, etc) will be more likely to slough off of a paper with less tooth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Surfaces are described as having more or less “tooth,” or roughness in texture. The more toothy the paper, the rougher its surface. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Rougher surfaces** are generally found more in thicker papers. *Thick, toothy surfaces hold on to more of the drawing or painting medium and are better for high contrast and lower detail works. Toothier papers are well suited to charcoal, crayon and pastels, ink washes and watercolor*, or any work that utilizes the texture of the paper for aesthetic effect. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Smoother surfaces** take up less media and are better suited to more detailed work. Very lightweight papers like tissue paper, and lightweight sketch paper are usually smooth, but thicker papers like bristol and some painting paper are also smooth. *Smoother surfaces are ideal for graphite pencil, colored pencil, and ink pens*. Smoother papers are also more likely to be bleedproof, meaning that ink or color washes won’t spread and “feather” across the surface.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Rough paper** is chosen for its definite texture. It is the natural result when a sheet is allowed to air dry without smoothing or pressing. Rough surface paper is a good choice for transparent watercolors used in a bold and immediate style, as it allows the pigment of color washes to settle into the hollows of the paper. Pastel artists also generally prefer a paper with &quot;tooth&quot; or texture to grab onto the pastel pigment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cold Press paper**, which is the most popular and versatile, has a slight texture. Handmade papers achieve this by re-pressing a new wet sheet, which smoothes the surface to some degree. Machine-made papers get a similar effect by placing the wet sheets between cold metal rollers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Not/Cold Press**: A &quot;Not&quot; sheet means it is &quot;not hot press,&quot; and the term is often used instead of cold press.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Hot Press paper** is very smooth. It is made by running a freshly formed sheet through heated metal rollers or plates. Much like a clothes iron, this smoothes out any texture left by the earlier stages and creates a flat, hard, featureless surface. A good choice for highly detailed illustrations, it is also used for printmaking, etching, drafting, sketching and drawing.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Secondary coniderations:  Fiber and Sizing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Fiber:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Paper is made from a variety of plant sources. Whether the fibers come from cotton or other plants such as linen, flax, jute, hemp, bamboo, rice straw or rattan, they all provide cellulose fibers or plant cells of varying dimensions. A sheet of paper is basically a thin layer of mingled cellulose fibers. Most commonly, three types of fibers are used to produce papers for drawing and painting: cotton, cellulose and a combination of fibers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cotton papers**, made from the longest cotton fibers, are *generally considered the highest quality*. They are referred to as being 100% cotton rag and *can handle heavy erasing and working without tearing or showing wear*. High-quality 100% cotton paper can last more than 100 years. However, not all cotton papers are the same. Those made from the lesser-quality, shorter cotton fibers can get fuzzy with reworking. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cellulose papers** are usually made of wood pulp and *naturally have an acid content that will destroy the paper over time. The more acidic a paper is, the shorter its life expectancy*. Buffers can be added to make the paper neutral.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Many papers are acid free. This designation means that the paper has a neutral pH (around 7). Acid-free papers should be selected for work intended to last for long periods of time because papers with higher acid content will deteriorate much faster. For most cellulose-based papers, acid-free also means that lignin and sulfur have been removed from the paper. These are the ingredients in wood-based papers that fade ink and turn paper yellow over time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cotton and cotton-rag paper** do not contain cellulose and are naturally acid-free. Cotton-based papers are also stronger, often thicker, hold up better to a lot of erasing, and perform well for wet media such as watercolor or ink washes. Cotton is often blended with cellulose to add strength and durability to paper. Premium archival papers will often list a ratio of cotton and wood fiber.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][3] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**pH neutral** means that the paper had a neutral pH (7) at the time that it was made, but may still contain ingredients that can become acidic over time (for example, the size used to seal the paper).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Acid free** means that nothing acidic (and nothing that can become acidic) was introduced to the paper at any point in the paper-making process. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Some manufacturers (such as Strathmore) take further precautions and make paper at a slightly basic pH of 7.2 to 7.5.  This provides an alkaline buffer to help counter anything acidic that it may come into contact with.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Drawing Source][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Sizing/Absorbency:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Sizing&quot; is an additive that makes the paper more resistant to moisture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Papers intended for wet media (paints or inks) are made with sizing, a starch or gelatin that is either included in the paper pulp during the paper-making process, or is applied to the surface of the paper.  Sizing prevents liquid from absorbing too quickly into the paper, allowing some working time to lift, lighten, or move paints or inks by applying more water.  Sizing also helps protect the paper from getting too soggy, which can result in tearing and wrinkling.  Sizing can also help prevent finer ink or paint lines from spreading and feathering.  Sketchbooks intended for wet media should indicate on the cover that the paper is sized.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sizing is added to make paper more water-resistant. It keeps the paper from absorbing too much moisture or pigment and helps to keep watercolors or inks brilliant. It also keeps lines and edges looking crisp. It is less important for papers used for dry media. Sizing also can factor into a paper's archival qualities - whether it will sustain or deteriorate over time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Internal sizing** is added while the paper pulp is still in a liquid state and is maintained in the matter of the paper. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**External, Surface or Tub sizing** is applied to the surface of the paper after the sheet is formed and dried. Some paper is both internally and surface-sized.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Other considerations:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Binding:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes a matter of mere personal preference, sometimes a matter of necessity, &quot;binding&quot; refers to how - and whether - the sheets of paper are connected to one another:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Hard-bound** sketchbooks have a hard cover and a sewn joint, just like a hard-bound book. These sketchbooks generally contain medium weight paper, about 70 lb. Hard-bound sketchbooks are the toughest and sometimes the expensive. They take more wear and tear, and generally survive longer than spiral or tape-bound books. Depending on the quality and method of binding, hard-bound sketchbooks often do not lay flat when opened all the way, so they can be difficult to use for larger drawings or for writing. Hard-bound sketchbooks are also less likely to have perforated pages, so they’re better thought of as real archival sketchbooks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Spiral-bound** sketchbooks sometimes have hard covers but their covers often consist of a hard back cover and a thick paper front. Because of this construction, spiral-bound books are a little less hardy than hard-bound sketchbooks. Spiral-bound sketchbooks open flat when put on a surface, so they can be good for ink and paint washes. Spiral-bound sketchbooks often have perforated pages, so pages are easy to remove and have a clean edge for presentation, duplication, mounting, or framing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Tape-bound** sketchbooks generally have fewer pages than hard-bound and spiral-bound sketchbooks and do not have substantial covers. Tape-bound sketchbooks are not rugged, long lasting sketchbooks. Sketchbooks bound in this manner come in a wide variety of surface types and weights, ranging from very thin tissue and tracing paper to heavy bristol and vellum papers. Sometimes, tape-bound sketchbook pages are perforated, but often the pages are held in by a line of adhesive so it is not difficult to pull them out.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Single sheets** are a great way to experiment with a limited quantity of paper. They will often require stretching and taping to remain flat if wet media is being used. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Blocks** are a stack of paper glued or bound together on all four sides and mounted on a backing board. A block keeps the paper stretched as you paint. Once the painting is dry, the sheet is removed by inserting a knife between the sheets and gently breaking the binding. Blocks are a good choice for working wet, outdoors or while traveling. The disadvantage is that you can only use one sheet at a time.    &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Printer Paper:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Compared to drawing paper, printer paper is cheaper, lower weight, more acidic, has less tooth, can't handle wet media, doesn't take much dry media, can't handle wet media, and is generally crappy in every important respect.  It works for doodling, but if you want to make something really beautiful and long-lived, you need quality paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.dickblick.com/productinfo/learn/paper/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-surfaces-and-weights/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-paper-quality/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.thedrawingsource.com/drawing-paper.html&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-binging-and-perforation/" />

I wrote that original comment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I sharpen my drawing pencils the &quot;proper&quot; way, with a knife.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was intending to be tongue-in-cheek, because you may find a lot of comments or tutorials online insisting that this is *the* right way to sharpen a pencil. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think that it's the case, but I've now written a little tutorial about the &quot;proper&quot; way to sharpen a pencil, and also some pointers about sharpening pencils in general. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Why use a knife?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using a knife to sharpen your pencil allows you to control the length and the shape of the exposed core. This, then, gives you more control over the types of strokes you'll be able to make. Longer points mean you can lay down wider lines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A knife is very helpful for sharpening graphite, charcoal, and pastel pencils. These types of materials hold up to the process better, and wider lines are more likely to be sought from them. As [John Cavan][1] pointed out, colored pencils don't really hold up to the process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What you'll need:&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- A sandpaper pad or block &#xD;&#xA;- A pencil&#xD;&#xA;- A very sharp knife&#xD;&#xA;- A quick way to get rid of the shavings&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The knife needs to be very sharp, because you don't want to apply much pressure to the pencil at all. The more pressure you have to apply, the more likely you are to break the exposed core *or* cause internal stress fractures that don't show up until much later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the knife is very sharp, please be careful. I prefer to use a utility knife, as shown, because the blades are sharp and easily replaceable when dull. I have used pocket knives before, but sharpening them is a whole other process. If you've never used a utility knife before, be aware that they generally come with spare blades inside them, so you don't have to buy extras right away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you've only just started sharpening pencils this way, **please use cheap pencils**. It's very common to break pencils until you get the hang of this. Practice the technique on something you're fine with throwing away. That said, be aware that some cheaper pencils use really cheap wood, which may be harder or more prone to splitting. You generally won't have that problem with actual art pencils.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I usually sharpen directly over a small trash can, but today I'm doing it over some scrap paper I can just pick up and shake out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##1. Starting&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Always hold the knife with the blade facing away from you. If you're concerned about the shavings flying into your eye, wear safety goggles.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hold the knife at about a 90 degree angle to your pencil, with the blade laying nearly flat against the wood. With the hand holding the pencil, put your thumb against the back of the blade and apply a slight pressure. You will start sharpening by pushing against the knife with your thumb, but **holding the knife completely still**. The hand with the pencil will do all the work, adjusting the speed and pressure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do shallow but long strokes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4][![enter image description here][5]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should end up with plenty of shavings, as you can see. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##2. Refining the tip&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you start to expose the core, be careful not to nick it. At first you'll start with only a small bit exposed, but then slowly work your way to exposing the full length you want. Make sure you're not just taking wood off the very front, but going back further up the pencil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][6]][6][![enter image description here][7]][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As picture above, I started by exposing only a small amount, but then shaved portions away from the entire tip to have more lead exposed. If you only work towards the front, the cone of the wood will be too short and increase the likelihood of breakage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once I have what I feel is about the correct length, I test the angle of the wood against a flat surface.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][8]][8]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If I can't get the wood flush with the surface, that's no good. The purpose of this type of sharpening is to allow for strokes using the full flat of the lead. If the wood is curved inwards (as seen above) or too short, then trying to use the flat may cause breakage. If the slope doesn't flow well into your actual core, then trying to lay the flat of the pencil down may only yield strokes with part of the tip.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wasn't happy with my slope, so I worked at it some more. At this point, I do small, quick shavings while rotating the pencil. I'll do this by using the knife to do the work, instead of pushing with my thumb, as it's much faster. However, I've practiced on a bunch of pencils and I'm confident I won't gouge my wood or break the lead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I ended up with a much smoother slope. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][9]][9]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##3. Perfecting the point&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you may have noticed, my point is still blunt! You don't need to sharpen that with the knife, as that's where the sanding pad comes in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][10]][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hold the pencil between your thumb and two fingers and roll it so that pencil rotates. You'll do this while rubbing the lead point along the sandpaper. Make steady, even strokes. Like before, **only the pencil should move**, and not the sandpaper. As you roll the pencil, the goal is to get a full 360 degree rotation, or close, in one full stroke.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason for this rotation is that it keeps the point centered in the core and keeps it conical. If you don't rotate enough, you may end up with more of a wedge or oblong shape. Those can be quite useful, if it's your goal, but generally you don't want those other shapes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also sharpen the point by sanding with your strokes following the length of the pencil, instead of perpendicular to the pencil. (I think of it as &quot;up and down&quot; instead of &quot;side to side&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][11]][11]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This lets you more easily match the point to the slope of the wood, if that's you're intent. You still need to rotate the pencil as you do this. I spent time making my slope nice, so I used a combination of strokes to get the point to match.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the end, I made a nice, long point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][12]][12]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you practice, you may end up making short or longer points, depending on your preference (or skill). The longer the point, the wider the strokes you can make, but also the more likely you are to have breaks while sharpening, using or storing your pencils.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##4. Clean up&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your sandpaper pad may look pretty grim after this. But if you bang it on your table or inside your bin, a fair amount of dust will come off. You can use one sheet for a considerable number of pencils, so don't throw it away too soon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][13]][13]  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Before&lt;/sub&gt;  &#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][14]][14]  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;After&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, **before actually using the pencil, you need to clean it off**, too. I typically make a bunch of test strokes, and even rub just the wooden part on the paper. A lot of the dust from your core will laying on the surface, and if you don't wipe it off you may end up laying down some accidental, very dark lines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can use a cloth for this, but I usually just use scratch paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][15]][15]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##The proper way, in general&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The keys to a sharp pencil, without breakage, are generally the same whether you're using a knife or a hand sharpener:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Have a sharp blade&#xD;&#xA; 2. Move the pencil, not the blade&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have a handful of sharpeners just like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][16]][16]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They work great for me. I just keep it steady in my offhand, and turn the pencil with my other. The blades are replaceable, but I have so many sharpeners that I haven't had to do that, yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, I only sharpen one set of by 9B - 9H range of pencils with a knife, and the rest get the hand sharpener treatment. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I avoid electric sharpeners for anything but writing pencils. They violate one of my guidelines, because the blade moves and not the pencil, so I already distrust them. Something about the process seems to increase the chance that the lead cracks internally, and I just end up sharpening them over and over.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They also get gummed up by colored pencils. Some companies make electric sharpeners just for colored pencils, but I haven't tried them so I can't comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/458/24&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/sLbxHm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/l291hm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dpzrxm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/o5qhym.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/bwIoLm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/jga5Im.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/7len7.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/USIPY.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/uwCAvm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/mbgqmm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/aSqZam.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NDhVam.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/uX7SOm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/CUYKwm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [16]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/73RVjm.jpg" />

Usually pink in colour and rough in texture (due to the abrasive). This is the same eraser type that would be found on pencils with erasers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These remove graphite by shredding themselves over the paper leaving bits behind. If used incorrectly they can damage your drawing surface by tearing the paper. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Pink eraser][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [Wikipedia][2]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Gum&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Usually large an brown in appearance. Can also be blue or transparent. They are generally softer to the touch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They will fall apart or crumble, in larger bits than other erasers that function this way, as they are used. This is by design and why most are larger, compared to other typical erasers. The bits help pull and hold the graphite. Because of how they function and the fact they are softer allows them to be used more easily over large areas and don't generally damage the paper. This also means they have a shorter life span. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![ArtGum eraser][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [Amazon.com][4]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Vinyl / White Plastic&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are white and the usually the toughest of the erasers discussed here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They are adept are removing a greater portion of the pencil and getting you back to paper. Graphite will stick to the eraser portion so one needs to be careful as you can accidentally transfer pencil to another spot on the page. There rigid shape allow you to cut them to remove used portions if you wanted or to create shapes and contours for more specialized removal. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Vinyl Eraser][5]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [artstuff.net][6]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Kneaded&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Almost all artists will have a kneaded eraser in their arsenal. They are very soft, mold-able and usually grey.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They are designed to conform to most any shape for detailed adjustment and a ergonomic hold if need be. They actually lift the graphite from the page to the eraser. Once that part of the eraser is not working as efficiently you would fold it back into the eraser to expose more unused surface. The picture below shows a new eraser to formed and then a used form (which is darker from graphite). There is next to no risk to the drawing surface when using these. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Kneaded eraser][7]][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [helloartsy.com][8]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Eraser Pencil&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are straight forward pencil with an eraser core. However the core can be like the pink eraser or a plastic vinyl one. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since they can be sharpened to a point and are for fine or detail work. A slightly larger variation of this is an eraser stick which has a long eraser core which gets pushed out in the same way you would a mechanical pencil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Eraser Pencil][9]][9]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [cultpens.com][10]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Electric&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are also simple to identify.

However, there are some things you can do to moderate the problem, in general (I'm going to answer a bit beyond the question).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Pencil Selection**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The pencils that tend to break more easily have off-center cores. If you're buying open stock, take a look at the bottom of the pencil and ensure that the core of it is in the center of the pencil body and not askew. None of mine are in this state, or I'd post a picture, but it's really obvious when you see it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sharpening Technique**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A little counter-intuitive, but I've found that instead of rotating the pencil in the sharpener, going the other way works better. In this scenario, hold your pencil in your &quot;off&quot; hand and then using your normal hand, rotate a very sharp sharpener around. This should be *very* sharp, the wood should shave off in a long, continuous strip. If it doesn't then it's time to replace.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, don't create a long point. Smaller amounts of exposed core tend to be less fragile and so don't break as often. Find a sharpener that lends itself to that or allows you to control the point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Fix It Up**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Prismas are wax based and can sometimes be fixed by heating the core to fuse it together again. Prismacolor doesn't recommend the microwave, rather a sunny window spot, but many use the microwave. Just keep it short, seconds at a time. After all, you're not looking to make it runny, just softened enough to fuse again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Handle With Care**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the lead is fragile, avoiding drops and bangs is a must. The problem, of course, is that transportation to your supplier probably banged and bashed them around, causing the odd one to break even before you got it. To that end, I really recommend going with open stock since you can check the pencils there and, as I noted above, you can confirm that it's not askew.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Change 'em Up**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the end of the day, the price of Prisma feel is the weakness of the lead. If you're reaching the point that it's too much, then there are alternatives. Faber-Castell and Caran d'Ache make great pencils and they don't have the breakage issue. That's partly because they're vegetable oil based rather than wax, but also the lead is bonded to the wood, so even if there is a break inside, all is not lost.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In any event, I have no familiarity with Caran d'Ache pencils to use, but the Faber-Castell Polychromos are really very good and also available in open stock. For me, open stock is a must. So, I have the full Polychromos set and a select bunch of Prismacolors (I generally prefer the white Prisma). They work together just fine." />

Each paper type uses a certain size as its &quot;standard.&quot; A ream of standard 22&quot; x 30&quot; watercolor paper (500 sheets) would weigh 300 lbs. The very same thickness paper in a 40&quot; x 60&quot; sheet would have a weight of 1,114 lbs. for the ream of paper. Its weight changed due to the size of the sheets, not the paper's thickness, but the paper is still designated as 300-lb. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The inconsistency of this traditional method has led to the use of metric measurements or grams per square meter or gsm. When paper is measured in gsm, its weight will not change with the size of the sheet. The same 22&quot; x 30&quot; sheet of watercolor paper described above would weigh 640gsm, meaning that a square meter of this paper would weigh 640 grams. Larger size sheets of that same paper, like a 40&quot; x 60&quot; size sheet, also would weigh 640gsm. While different sizes, the square meter remains constant, as does the thickness of the paper.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Weights (relating to thickness) of paper are standardized and defined by the International Organization for Standardization and are often listed in grams per square meter (gsm), or in pounds, the standard of measurement more familiar to most artists in the U.S.  Following are some of the most common weights of paper found in sketchbooks and drawing pads (all measurements are approximate):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;25 lb (approx 40 gsm):  tracing paper  &#xD;&#xA;30-35 lb (approx 45-50 gsm):  newsprint  &#xD;&#xA;50-60 lb (approx 75-90 gsm):  sketching or practice paper — thick enough to work on with pencils, charcoal, or pastels, but usually too thin for ink or most markers, which may bleed through.  &#xD;&#xA;70-80 lb (approx 100-130 gsm): drawing paper suitable for finished artwork in most media.  Paper any lighter than 70lb will usually be thin enough to see through to drawings or materials underneath.  &#xD;&#xA;90-110 lb (approx 180-260 gsm):  heavy-weight drawing paper, bristol, multi-media papers.  Weight in this range is similar to card stock or light poster board.   &#xD;&#xA;Heavier papers, up to 140 lb (approx 300 gsm) or more, are most often used for painting rather than drawing.  When found in sketchbooks, they are usually rougher papers intended as watercolor journals or to remove for painting on individual sheets.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Sketch paper** is the thinnest, lightest paper, varying from 30 to 60 lbs. It isn't meant be used for finished drawings, as most will discolor and degrade quickly. However, it's economical, and perfect for short studies, thumbnails, compositional sketches, and working out ideas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Watercolor or printmaking paper** has to be the thickest, heaviest paper because it must withstand the moisture from the water media applied to it. It usually weighs between 90 and 140 lbs. (The smoother, hot press watercolor papers can be great for drawing, also!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Graphite or charcoal** drawing paper doesn't need the durability of watercolor or printmaking paper, but is heavier than sketch paper. It usually weighs between 70 and 100 lbs. The weight you choose should depend on how you work with your medium.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Drawing Source][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Tooth:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Tooth&quot; is a measure of how rough or smooth the paper's surface texture is.  The more tooth a paper has, the rougher it is, and the better it will take soft art media like charcoal and pastels.  The less tooth it has, the smoother it is, and the better it will be for fine detail work, harder graphite, pen and ink, etc.  Wet media (ink, watercolors, etc) will be more likely to bleed on a toothier paper;  dry media (charcoal, pastels, etc) will be more likely to slough off of a paper with less tooth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Surfaces are described as having more or less “tooth,” or roughness in texture. The more toothy the paper, the rougher its surface. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Rougher surfaces** are generally found more in thicker papers. *Thick, toothy surfaces hold on to more of the drawing or painting medium and are better for high contrast and lower detail works. Toothier papers are well suited to charcoal, crayon and pastels, ink washes and watercolor*, or any work that utilizes the texture of the paper for aesthetic effect. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Smoother surfaces** take up less media and are better suited to more detailed work. Very lightweight papers like tissue paper, and lightweight sketch paper are usually smooth, but thicker papers like bristol and some painting paper are also smooth. *Smoother surfaces are ideal for graphite pencil, colored pencil, and ink pens*. Smoother papers are also more likely to be bleedproof, meaning that ink or color washes won’t spread and “feather” across the surface.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Rough paper** is chosen for its definite texture. It is the natural result when a sheet is allowed to air dry without smoothing or pressing. Rough surface paper is a good choice for transparent watercolors used in a bold and immediate style, as it allows the pigment of color washes to settle into the hollows of the paper. Pastel artists also generally prefer a paper with &quot;tooth&quot; or texture to grab onto the pastel pigment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cold Press paper**, which is the most popular and versatile, has a slight texture. Handmade papers achieve this by re-pressing a new wet sheet, which smoothes the surface to some degree. Machine-made papers get a similar effect by placing the wet sheets between cold metal rollers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Not/Cold Press**: A &quot;Not&quot; sheet means it is &quot;not hot press,&quot; and the term is often used instead of cold press.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Hot Press paper** is very smooth. It is made by running a freshly formed sheet through heated metal rollers or plates. Much like a clothes iron, this smoothes out any texture left by the earlier stages and creates a flat, hard, featureless surface. A good choice for highly detailed illustrations, it is also used for printmaking, etching, drafting, sketching and drawing.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Secondary coniderations:  Fiber and Sizing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Fiber (and acidity):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Paper is made from a variety of plant sources. Whether the fibers come from cotton or other plants such as linen, flax, jute, hemp, bamboo, rice straw or rattan, they all provide cellulose fibers or plant cells of varying dimensions. A sheet of paper is basically a thin layer of mingled cellulose fibers. Most commonly, three types of fibers are used to produce papers for drawing and painting: cotton, cellulose and a combination of fibers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cotton papers**, made from the longest cotton fibers, are *generally considered the highest quality*. They are referred to as being 100% cotton rag and *can handle heavy erasing and working without tearing or showing wear*. High-quality 100% cotton paper can last more than 100 years. However, not all cotton papers are the same. Those made from the lesser-quality, shorter cotton fibers can get fuzzy with reworking. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cellulose papers** are usually made of wood pulp and *naturally have an acid content that will destroy the paper over time. The more acidic a paper is, the shorter its life expectancy*. Buffers can be added to make the paper neutral.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Many papers are acid free. This designation means that the paper has a neutral pH (around 7). Acid-free papers should be selected for work intended to last for long periods of time because papers with higher acid content will deteriorate much faster. For most cellulose-based papers, acid-free also means that lignin and sulfur have been removed from the paper. These are the ingredients in wood-based papers that fade ink and turn paper yellow over time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cotton and cotton-rag paper** do not contain cellulose and are naturally acid-free. Cotton-based papers are also stronger, often thicker, hold up better to a lot of erasing, and perform well for wet media such as watercolor or ink washes. Cotton is often blended with cellulose to add strength and durability to paper. Premium archival papers will often list a ratio of cotton and wood fiber.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][4] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**pH neutral** means that the paper had a neutral pH (7) at the time that it was made, but may still contain ingredients that can become acidic over time (for example, the size used to seal the paper).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Acid free** means that nothing acidic (and nothing that can become acidic) was introduced to the paper at any point in the paper-making process. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Some manufacturers (such as Strathmore) take further precautions and make paper at a slightly basic pH of 7.2 to 7.5.  This provides an alkaline buffer to help counter anything acidic that it may come into contact with.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Drawing Source][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The rate and severity of deterioration result from internal and external factors: most importantly, the composition of the paper and the conditions under which the paper is stored.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Paper is made of cellulose -- a repeating chain of glucose molecules -- derived from plant cell walls. One measure of paper quality is how long the cellulose chains, and subsequently the paper fibers, are: long-fibered paper is stronger and more flexible and durable than short-fibered paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In the presence of moisture, acids from the environment (e.g., air pollution, poor-quality enclosures), or from within the paper (e.g., from the raw materials, manufacturing process, deterioration products), repeatedly cut the glucose chains into shorter lengths. This acid hydrolysis reaction produces more acids, feeding further, continued degradation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Mechanical pulping produces paper with the shortest fiber length and does not remove lignin from the wood, which promotes acid hydrolysis. Newspapers are printed on mechanically pulped paper. Chemical pulping removes lignin and does not cut up the cellulose chains as thoroughly as mechanical pulping, yielding a comparatively stronger paper, but which is still not as durable as rag paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Wood pulp paper from before the 1980's also tends to be acidic from alum-rosin sizing (added to the paper to reduce absorbency and minimize bleeding of inks), which, in the presence of moisture, generates sulfuric acid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Acids also form in paper by the absorption of pollutants -- mainly sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Book leaves that are more brown and brittle along the edges than in the center clearly illustrate this absorption of pollutants from the air.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Research by the Library of Congress has demonstrated that cellulose itself generates acids as it ages, including formic, acetic, lactic, and oxalic acids. Measurable quantities of these acids were observed to form under ambient conditions within weeks of the paper's manufacture. Moreover, paper does not readily release these acids due to strong inter-molecular bonding. This explains why pH neutral papers become increasingly acidic as they age.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [U.S. Library of Congress][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Sizing/Absorbency:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Sizing&quot; is an additive that makes the paper more resistant to moisture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Papers intended for wet media (paints or inks) are made with sizing, a starch or gelatin that is either included in the paper pulp during the paper-making process, or is applied to the surface of the paper.  Sizing prevents liquid from absorbing too quickly into the paper, allowing some working time to lift, lighten, or move paints or inks by applying more water.  Sizing also helps protect the paper from getting too soggy, which can result in tearing and wrinkling.  Sizing can also help prevent finer ink or paint lines from spreading and feathering.  Sketchbooks intended for wet media should indicate on the cover that the paper is sized.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sizing is added to make paper more water-resistant. It keeps the paper from absorbing too much moisture or pigment and helps to keep watercolors or inks brilliant. It also keeps lines and edges looking crisp. It is less important for papers used for dry media. Sizing also can factor into a paper's archival qualities - whether it will sustain or deteriorate over time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Internal sizing** is added while the paper pulp is still in a liquid state and is maintained in the matter of the paper. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**External, Surface or Tub sizing** is applied to the surface of the paper after the sheet is formed and dried. Some paper is both internally and surface-sized.  &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Other considerations:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Binding:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes a matter of mere personal preference, sometimes a matter of necessity, &quot;binding&quot; refers to how - and whether - the sheets of paper are connected to one another:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Hard-bound** sketchbooks have a hard cover and a sewn joint, just like a hard-bound book. These sketchbooks generally contain medium weight paper, about 70 lb. Hard-bound sketchbooks are the toughest and sometimes the expensive. They take more wear and tear, and generally survive longer than spiral or tape-bound books. Depending on the quality and method of binding, hard-bound sketchbooks often do not lay flat when opened all the way, so they can be difficult to use for larger drawings or for writing. Hard-bound sketchbooks are also less likely to have perforated pages, so they’re better thought of as real archival sketchbooks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Spiral-bound** sketchbooks sometimes have hard covers but their covers often consist of a hard back cover and a thick paper front. Because of this construction, spiral-bound books are a little less hardy than hard-bound sketchbooks. Spiral-bound sketchbooks open flat when put on a surface, so they can be good for ink and paint washes. Spiral-bound sketchbooks often have perforated pages, so pages are easy to remove and have a clean edge for presentation, duplication, mounting, or framing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Tape-bound** sketchbooks generally have fewer pages than hard-bound and spiral-bound sketchbooks and do not have substantial covers. Tape-bound sketchbooks are not rugged, long lasting sketchbooks. Sketchbooks bound in this manner come in a wide variety of surface types and weights, ranging from very thin tissue and tracing paper to heavy bristol and vellum papers. Sometimes, tape-bound sketchbook pages are perforated, but often the pages are held in by a line of adhesive so it is not difficult to pull them out.   &#xD;&#xA;-  [Muse Art and Design][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Single sheets** are a great way to experiment with a limited quantity of paper. They will often require stretching and taping to remain flat if wet media is being used. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Blocks** are a stack of paper glued or bound together on all four sides and mounted on a backing board. A block keeps the paper stretched as you paint. Once the painting is dry, the sheet is removed by inserting a knife between the sheets and gently breaking the binding. Blocks are a good choice for working wet, outdoors or while traveling. The disadvantage is that you can only use one sheet at a time.    &#xD;&#xA;-  [Dick Blick][1]   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Printer Paper:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Compared to drawing paper, printer paper is cheaper, lower weight, more acidic, has less tooth, can't handle wet media, doesn't take much dry media, can't handle wet media, and is generally crappy in every important respect.  It works for doodling, but if you want to make something really beautiful and long-lived, you need quality paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.dickblick.com/productinfo/learn/paper/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-surfaces-and-weights/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.thedrawingsource.com/drawing-paper.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-paper-quality/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/deterioratebrochure.html&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-binging-and-perforation/" />

Following the instructions on the bottle would be important to ensure you are using the glue properly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When gluing macaroni make sure the entire surface, where the noodle is contacting the paper, is also covered in glue for best adhesion (No exposed ends). You don't want to hide the glue. A good dollop of glue that also surrounds the noodle works best. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;it's hard to get it to stick without an obscene amount of glue or decoupage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am actually not sure why you had issues. That being said I don't know what you consider obscene and what glues you used and your specific paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;--- &#xD;&#xA;__Forward__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While not a comprehensive experiment as I was testing with products and materials that I had available. I do think between the two of these you should have a good basis for choice though. My breakage tests also are slightly flawed as I don't have the tools to measure pressure exerted nor the ability to make each break with the exact same circumstances. There are other glues that I could have used, however, given my findings, I think the issues would have been the same. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Glues not tested__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are things that I could not test with and choose not use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think a glue stick or glue dots would be good for this. Hot glue gun could work and even double sided tape. In the case of the latter you might have an aesthetics issue. Gorilla glue or PVA's would also work. Gorilla Glue is an expands while it dries, which I know from experience, so it might not be what you want to use here as it might warp the work. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Test materials and setup__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tested with 3 different paper stocks. Canvas paper, thin cardstock and printer paper. For glues I used carpenters glue (Yellow) and white craft glue. These glues can be considered kid safe and non-toxic. Consult product labels to be sure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I used brand-less macaroni that I purchased specifically to do macaroni art. The glue was applied with different consistencies to see if the amount of glue was important. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Procedure__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For each piece of paper I logically divided it into 8 parts. Each glue was given an indicator box and 3 spots where the glue was applied lightly, heavy and an in-between consistency. The white glue had nozzle so I was able to apply it easily. My yellow glue nozzle broke ages ago so I used a craft stick to apply it. The two below pictures show how much of each glue was applied. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Glue samples][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I then proceeded to add one piece of macaroni to each glue site. I made sure that the macaroni was lying flat to the paper to increase the gluing surface area. This picture shows the tests in a completed a drying state. The glue is still wet as this point. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Glue samples][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The drying times for each glue was 30-35 minutes. The carpenters glue recommended 24 to allow a full cure. I waited 12 hours before I tested and I think that is fair. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Strength test__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I mentioned earlier that this needs to be taken with a grain of salt so I don't suggest using this as a thesis source. This also doesn't cover long term durability&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Here is a picture of the macaronis after I put in effort to remove them all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Noodle massacre][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From left to right: printer paper, light cardstock, canvas paper&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To remove the noodles I used my thumb and pushed from the side of the noodles. There were some that I could not remove like that an had to grab from the end. If the end was not glue I was able to grab under it and pull. If the end were completely glued I would not have been able to do that and it should have been harder to pull off. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Findings__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found the yellow caprenters glue to be better than the white craft glue but not by much. In all cases the glue held and the _paper_ failed. As you can see in some pictures the noodles actually broke. I found the canvas paper to hold onto the noodles better. Likely that is because it was thicker and had a textured surface. The printer paper failed easier. In the printer paper's defense the glue still help to the paper rather well. Still, it was the weakest as I expected it to be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The glues warped the printer paper significantly and the cardstock somewhat. While I do notice that the other side of the canvas was wet the overall shape was not change i.e. it remained flat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short if I was to choose, based on best results, my option would be yellow glue with the canvas paper. I would use enough glue to cover the entire noodle and have enough to sightly pool around it (My heavy option pictured above). The cardstock I used was perfectly fine though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1: I do have a tangential case I can refer to for this though. 3 years previous to this post I made a anniversary gift for my wife that was macaroni art. I used the exact same macaroni (from the same box) and yellow carpenters glue. This was applied to a small section of wood. My wife displays this in our living room as she thinks its funny. After 3 years none of the pieces have fallen off (This has not been in direct sunlight the entire time). A couple noodles shattered from a fall a while back but the macaroni portion that was glued did not. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/kBjk3.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIs0Z.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lEYwr.png" />

Usually pink in colour and rough in texture (due to the abrasive). This is the same eraser type that would be found on pencils with erasers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These remove graphite by shredding themselves over the paper leaving bits behind. If used incorrectly they can damage your drawing surface by tearing the paper. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are also black and white erasers of similar firmness, but erase slightly more like the vinyl/polymer erasers. They are still abrasive, but less prone to tearing or wearing away your paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [heartclass.com][2]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Gum&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Usually large an brown in appearance. Can also be blue or transparent. They are generally softer to the touch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They will fall apart or crumble, in larger bits than other erasers that function this way, as they are used. This is by design and why most are larger, compared to other typical erasers. The bits help pull and hold the graphite. Because of how they function and the fact they are softer allows them to be used more easily over large areas and don't generally damage the paper. This also means they have a shorter life span. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![ArtGum eraser][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [Amazon.com][4]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Vinyl / White Plastic&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are white and the usually the toughest of the erasers discussed here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They are adept are removing a greater portion of the pencil and getting you back to paper. Graphite will stick to the eraser portion so one needs to be careful as you can accidentally transfer pencil to another spot on the page. There rigid shape allow you to cut them to remove used portions if you wanted or to create shapes and contours for more specialized removal. They come in multiple colors, but their function is identical. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Vinyl Eraser][5]][5] [![enter image description here][6]][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [artstuff.net][7] and currys.com&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Kneaded&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Almost all artists will have a kneaded eraser in their arsenal. They are very soft, mold-able and usually grey.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They are designed to conform to most any shape for detailed adjustment and a ergonomic hold if need be. They actually lift the graphite from the page to the eraser. Once that part of the eraser is not working as efficiently you would fold it back into the eraser to expose more unused surface. The picture below shows a new eraser to formed and then a used form (which is darker from graphite). There is next to no risk to the drawing surface when using these. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Kneaded eraser][8]][8]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [helloartsy.com][9]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Eraser Pencil and Stick&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are straight forward pencil with an eraser core. However the core can be like the pink eraser or a plastic vinyl one. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since they can be sharpened to a point and are for fine or detail work. A slightly larger variation of this is an eraser stick which has a long eraser core which gets pushed out in the same way you would a mechanical pencil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Eraser Pencil][10]][10] [![Eraser Stick][11]][11]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Images from [cultpens.com][12] and [dick-blick.com][13]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Electric&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are also simple to identify.

Natural bristles are made from some sort of animal hair, such as hog or badger. Synthetic bristles are often made from nylon, polyester, or a combination of both. Natural-bristle brushes are best for applying oil-based alkyd paints, and synthetic-bristle brushes are recommended for water-based latex paints. If you try to apply latex paint with a natural-bristle brush, the bristles will absorb the water in the paint and become extremely limp, making it virtually impossible to spread the paint.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Some synthetic brushes can be used to apply both latex and alkyd paints. Be sure to check the packaging on the brush to ensure it's compatible with the paint you're using.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt; [source](http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7647/which-paintbrush-should-you-use/)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a bonus, the same site also gives some information on the *shape* as well as the material of paintbrush bristles:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Bristle Shape:** Most paintbrushes available today are square-cut brushes. They're perfect for holding and laying paint onto virtually any surface. However, square-cut brushes don't provide as much control when painting into corners, up to adjacent surfaces, or along narrow edges or surfaces. For more precise control, use a sash brush, which has its bristles cut at a slight angle. Sash brushes are particularly well-suited for cutting in around the perimeter of a room.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Bristle Tips:** Better quality brushes have bristles with flagged, or split, ends. Flagged bristles hold more paint and spread paint more smoothly. Some brushes, especially sash brushes, have tipped ends, which should not be confused with flagged ends. Tipped brushes come to a point; they're not cut flat and straight, as is a standard brush.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Professional painters favor tipped brushes because they provide greater control and allow you to apply paint more precisely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More details on different types&#xD;&#xA;-&#xD;&#xA;[This list](http://www.dickblick.com/info/brushhair/) goes into more detail on the usages of synthetic and various types of natural bristles, although it doesn't distinguish between different types of synthetic material:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Badger**&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   For blending oil paint on canvas, Badger Hair is an age-old tradtion. It comes from various parts of the world and is more readily available than most animal hair, although the quality varies greatly. Badger hair is thickest at the point, and relatively thin at the root, so it has a distinctive &quot;bushy&quot; appearance.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: oil&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Camel Hair**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Camel Hair does not come from camels at all. It is found in watercolor and lettering brushes and usually is made of squirrel, goat, ox, pony or a blend of several hairs, depending on the desired softness and intended cost of the brush.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: lettering, tempera, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Hog Bristle**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Hog Bristle is obtained from hogs in several parts of the world, the most sought after coming from China. Bristle is unlike any other natural filler in that it forms a V-shaped split or &quot;flag&quot; at the tip and tends to have a natural curve. A brush with &quot;interlocked&quot; bristles, with the curves formed inward to the ferrule, has a natural resistance to fraying and spreads medium to thick paints smoothly and evenly. A selection of pure hog bristle brushes is recommended for oil and acrylic painting, and is a far less expensive alternative to good-quality softer hairs.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: acrylic, oil&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Kevrin/Mongoose Hair**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Kevrin/Mongoose Hair is strong, resilient, and makes a good long-wearing, medium to professional quality brush for oil and acrylic painting.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: acrylic, oil&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Kolinsky Sable**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Kolinsky Sable is not really from a sable at all, but comes from the tail of a species of mink that is a member of the weasel family found in Siberia and northeastern China. It is generally conceded to be the best material for oil and watercolor brushes due to its strength, spring and ability to retain its shape (&quot;snap&quot;). It holds a very fine point or edge. This is considered a professional grade of hair, and if properly cared for, Kolinsky will last for many years.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA, oil, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Ox Hair**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   The best quality comes from the ears of cattle or oxen. The Ox Hair has a very strong body with silken texture, is very resilient, has good &quot;snap&quot;, but lacks a fine tip. Therefore, it is most useful in medium gradewash brushes, or flat shaped brushes. Frequently, ox hair is blended with other natural hair to increase the resiliency of a brush.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: lettering, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Pony Hair**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Pony Hair is soft but strong, from mature animals at least 2 years of age. It is primarily used for scholastic grade brushes, but often blended with other hairs for inexpensive watercolor and touch-up brushes.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: acrylic, scholastic, tempera, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Red Sable**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Red Sable is obtained from any member of the weasel family with &quot;red&quot; hair, not at all from the animal known as the sable. It is found in a variety of brush styles for many varied mediums, with quality and characteristics varying greatly. A good quality pure Red Sable is a good alternative to the more expensive Kolinsky, with similar performance and durability. Often, weasel hair is blended with ox hair to make a more economical brush, but the fine point is sacrificed.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: oil, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Sabeline**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Sabeline is actually select, light-colored ox hair dyed to resembled red sable. Lettering and watercolor brushes often use Sabeline mixed with Sable to lower the cost of a brush.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: lettering, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Squirrel**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Gray Squirrel (Talayoutky), most highly in demand for lettering brushes and quills, is native to Russia and nearly always fell in short supply. Brown squirrel (Kazan) is more readily available, and is used mainly for medium quality and scholastic watercolor brushes. A very fine, thin hair, taken from squirrel tails, it points as well as Kolinsky, but has very little &quot;snap&quot; because the hair is not very resilient. It works best with liquid paints and inks.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: lettering, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Synthetic**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Synthetics are man-made of either nylon or polyester filaments. They can be tapered, tipped, flagged, abraded or etched to increase color carrying ability. Often, synthetic filaments are dyed and baked to make them softer and more absorbent. The common name for this filament is &quot;Taklon&quot;. Advantages of synthetic brushes are: 1) They are less prone to damage from solvents, insects or paints. 2) They are easier to keep clean than animal hair brushes because the filaments don't have animal scale structures to trap paint. 3) They are less prone to breakage and are durable on many different surfaces. 4) They are better suited for painting with acrylics because a synthetic filament will withstand the caustic nature of acrylic paints with less damage.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: all&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, [this list](http://www.gordonbrush.com/material_descriptions.php) goes into even greater detail on a huge variety of types of bristle, falling into four main families: **animal hair**, **vegetable fibre**, **synthetic**, and **wire brush**. Within each of these families, several different materials are described and compared. It's too long to copy it all here, but should be useful as further reading if the above isn't detailed enough." />

In Zanzibar specifically, according to the website [Zanzibar Tribal Art](http://www.zanzibartribalart.com/AboutZuluBaskets.htm), **grass** and **ilala palm** are used in their weaving:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The products of grass and ilala palm weaving (such things as sleeping mats) and basketry are associated with the widest possible range of activities throughout a Zulu’s lifetime, touching virtually every domestic, social, and religious function.  These baskets are evidence of the expertise of these artisans and their ingenuity for using indigenous plants.  Traditionally Zulu women weave the African Zulu baskets using age-old, time-honored methods that are passed on from mother to child.  The patterns, each with their own meaning, vary from decorative bands to intricate triangles, diamonds, zig-zags, and checkerboard motifs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know how easy such materials would be to find in Central Europe, but [apparently](http://www.italiansrus.com/palms/palmpatterns.htm) it's a strong tradition in Italy, [where](http://www.folladorprosecco.de/italian-traditions/):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; All over Italy you will find decorative palms that have been exchanged as gifts, hung above doors or been placed in homes for good fortune. The art of palm weaving itself involves twisting the palm leaves into elaborate decorative designs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More generally, it's a Catholic custom, and done in Catholic communities of various countries including Germany and Poland. According to [this blogger](http://amandarosehelen.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/palm-weaving.html) (emphasis mine):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Keeping braided palms around the house** is part of this Catholic culture, and I continue to practice it just as my parents and grandparents did. When I was younger, I tended to associate this tradition with yet another oddly rural thing my family still observed, but in reality it is not so much rural as it **is a German and Polish Catholic tradition**, which makes sense why my family did it. Sadly, it is starting to become a lost art. That is the thing with traditions; they are only continued if they are passed down to the next generation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it looks as though palm leaves suitable for weaving should be reasonably easy to acquire in various European countries." />

Left-handed pencil users can also take advantage of smudge-resistant H leads. On the downside, hard leads tend to be scratchy, especially as you move up the scale. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; B leads are smooth to write and draw with. They smudge easily, but are readily erased. They're perfect for pencil drawings as artists can take advantage of the brush-like expressions, especially in the higher B grades. Animators in particular enjoy using 10B over animator paper because it writes like butter, creating nice, quick, heavy lines with no friction. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil#Grading_and_classification&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koh-i-Noor_Hardtmuth&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://pencils.com/hb-graphite-grading-scale/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/c8J8T.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.jetpens.com/blog/picking-the-perfect-pencil-hardness-grade/pt/475" />

The substance was so soft and brittle that it required a holder. (Originally, the grey metallic-sheened substance was thought to be a form of lead ore. Hence, the words for ‘pencil’ in several languages literally mean ‘lead pen’. It was not until 1789 that the chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele proved that graphite and lead sulfide were two different minerals, and the geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner coined the name graphite, which stems from ‘gráphein’, meaning ‘to write’ or ‘to draw’ in Greek.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When the supply of natural graphite from Borrowdale ran short, the graphite was thinned down with other materials. In 1794, Nicholas-Jaques Conté and Joseph Hardtmuth independently discovered almost at the same time that by mixing graphite with clay it was possible to produce leads with different degrees of hardness, which would preserve the graphite deposits and also accommodate a variety of applications.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The graphite-clay mixing process was improved by Lothar von Faber in 1839. It was at that time that the hardness grade scale was established. Today, the scale encompasses 17 grades of hardness: 8B–B, HB, F, H–7H. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to Ullmann’s _Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry,_ the clay content varies from 15 % in the softest lead to ca. 60 % in the hardest. A mixture of about 2 parts of graphite and 1 part of clay gives the usual HB or 2 1/2 degrees of hardness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following image is adapted from product information for the _Castell 9000,_ which is available in 16 degrees of hardness:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![degrees of hardness][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same scale of hardness is used in ISO standards (for example for the determination of film hardness of paints by pencil test; in this test method, calibrated pencils of known hardness are pushed over the film). The hardness scale in use in the United States employs only numbers. The most important grades in the two scales approximately have the following relationship:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 3B – 1&#xD;&#xA; - 2B – 1 1/2&#xD;&#xA; - B – 2&#xD;&#xA; - HB – 2 1/2&#xD;&#xA; - F – 3&#xD;&#xA; - H – 3 1/2&#xD;&#xA; - 2H – 4&#xD;&#xA; - 3H – 4 1/2&#xD;&#xA; - 4H – 5&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Wx2P.png" />

Make two cardboard discs. They will be shaped like a doughnut with pie slice removed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [![The discs][6]][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Place a small tail of yarn in between those discs. You will be using this to tie of later much in the same way as the other method above. This is a _very_ important part as this will be used to hold the whole pom together. You need to always be aware of where this string is during the process and not lose in inside the yarn wraps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; If your yarn is weak and prone to snapping under tension you should use something stronger. Wire work here as well if these will be part of a larger project. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [![The center yarn][7]][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Starting wrapping as much yarn as you deem necessary around the doughnut/circle. The more you use the tighter your pom will be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [![Start wrapping][8]][8]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Get scissors and cut the yarn in between the discs. Again, be aware of the location of the yarn tail so as to not cut it or lose it. You will have to hold the center of the discs to keep them together until you tie off. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Use the tail and tie around the cut yarn. You should be able to remove the disc now. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Beyond that the rest is the same. Fluff up the yarn to make your ball. Trim to get a more spherical shape. Use a brush if that effect is desired.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Disc Variation&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is at least one other variation to the cardboard disc method that uses specialized templates.

[This page](https://decoratingadvice.co.uk/paint/exterior-masonry-paints) from a decorating advice site tells you which kind of paint to use in which context. It's written from the point of view of painting walls of a building, but some of it may still be useful to you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In particular, mineral-based or lime-based paint should fit your criterion of being eco-friendly, and **limewash** looks like the best choice for your situation: it's simple to make, relatively cheap, looks natural, and is eco-friendly. The following quoted text taken from the above link even provides you with possibilities for where to buy it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Mineral Based Exterior Paints**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Put simply,  mineral paints are made with a silicate binder which reacts with the surface of the wall to form a long-lasting bond, unlike traditional paints which simply form a skin. They are naturally alkaline, so inhibit mould growth and carbonation; mineral paints also have the added advantage of being eco-friendly too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The disadvantage is that they require more thorough preparation, special primers and are, initially, much more expensive – although the increased performance should pay back over the long term.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There are a few specialist manufacturers of mineral based paints – the main two being [Keim](http://www.keimpaints.co.uk/) and [Beeck](http://www.beeck.com/en/index.php).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Each have their own detailed specifications for different kinds of wall surface and these must be followed to the letter in order to enjoy the maximum performance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Lime Rendered Walls**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For old buildings with a lime based render or lime based pointing a traditional Limewash is ideal. Limewash is simply a paint made from lime powder and water together with a colourant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The main advantages of limewash are they bind to the surface very well and are totally breathable – another benefit is that they are relatively inexpensive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Care needs to be taken with application and sometimes additional binders need to be added to aid adhesion.The finished result can be very striking though – looking much more natural than a traditional paint finish.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Limewash paints are available from a number of sources including [Ecos](http://www.ecosorganicpaints.co.uk/store/limewash-paint-uk/prod_108.html), [Ty-Mawr](http://www.lime.org.uk/products/wall-paints/limewash/ty-mawr-limewash/), [Little Greene](http://www.littlegreene.com/paint/finish/limewash) and [Farrow &amp; Ball](http://www.farrow-ball.com/pws/client/images/content/advicesheets/UK_Limewash.pdf).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **ECO Paints**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Technically, an ECO paint is simply a paint which has a very low or zero volume of [Volatile Organic Compounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound). While some ECO paints are obviously superior to others there isn’t any case for suggesting that an ECO paint will perform any better or worse than any other form of exterior paint – it will simply be a matter of personal choice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It’s worth noting, however, that mineral and lime based finishes, mentioned above, are by their very nature eco-friendly – so would make a good choice if you wanted to be as environmentally friendly as possible?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;I also found [detailed instructions](http://www.artline.co.nz/Headstone-Repainting.pdf) on how to repaint a gravestone. They recommend using oil-based paint, assuming a granite headstone. If you're thinking more along the lines of smaller stones or pebbles, then [this site](https://feltmagnet.com/crafts/PAINTING-AND-DRAWING-ON-STONES) recommends using acrylic paint, with a sealer on top at the end." />

You will probably not just lay down a single dark line and blend outward, like my last column. Instead, you'd create a gradation yourself by using pencil pressure and different hardness pencils, then blend those values together with your tool.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortillon&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(drawing)&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ML2V0m.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://rapidfireart.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/AFcfum.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gzqy6.jpg" />

Always start your stroke from the darkest value and move outward.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - You can also blend in circles or back and forth, which may be the most helpful for trying to get a single area to be one value that's smoothed out, so the strokes don't show.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, there's also tools made specifically for this, called [tortillons][1] and [blending stumps][2]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Pic courtesy [rapidfireart.com][4]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They're made of tightly-wound paper. Tortillons being less tight than stumps, likely hollow, and you can clearly see the layers of paper, like the tip of a [grease pencil][5]. Blending stumps are so tightly wound that the seem more like a solid chunk of the paper with a point sanded off.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These give you much more precision over the blending. They come in many sizes, which makes them more adaptable than the five sizes of your fingers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A plus to these is that as they blend, they tend to pick up more of the graphite dust in their fibers, evenly spreading it around the area and getting dust off so you don't need to use a brush or air. Your finger will end up absorbing the graphite or charcoal, but will layer it and compress it from the pressure. These can lead to you smudging dark areas of light ones accidentally if you forget to clean up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The downside is that the tortillons don't really clean up, so if they get too much graphite built up, you'll only want to use them for matching values. To counter this, most tortillons you can purchase have the ability to peel away the outside layer. Failing that, you can use a sandpaper pad, similar to what you can use to sharpen a pencil, to rub off the rough edge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my experience, tortillons, both bought and homemade, tend to give a softer blend than stumps. I've made my own tortillons by wrapping up old drawing paper (possibly with a bad sketch on the inside) and taping the end seam. These homemade tortillons have given me the softest blends, as the dull point often frays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][6]][6]   &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;My homemade tortillon, not a weird cigarette. Notice the curved, feathery tip.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's a comparison of the four tools I mentioned, using an HB pencil:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][7]][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The first column is blending a solid area, mostly back and forth (not against the strokes, which would blend more evenly).&#xD;&#xA; - The stump and homemade tool hide the strokes the best, in this case.&#xD;&#xA;- The second column is a few tight lines, stroking along them. &#xD;&#xA; - Notice the finger smudged well outside it (oops!), and the others were more precise. However, the homemade one had much &quot;fuzzier&quot; edges, which can be nice.&#xD;&#xA;- The last column is gradating out from dark.&#xD;&#xA; - As you go down the column, you'll see each tool, in this case, was better and blending from the dark line, so there's not so much of a hard edge between the dark and light. &#xD;&#xA; - The other thing to notice is that the strokes are almost invisible on the finger patch, and much less visible on the homemade stick.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I didn't blend any two values together for this demo. You will probably not just lay down a single dark line and blend outward, like my last column. Instead, you'd create a gradation yourself by using pencil pressure and different hardness pencils, then blend those values together with your tool.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortillon&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(drawing)&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ML2V0m.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://rapidfireart.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_pencil&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/AFcfum.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gzqy6.jpg" />

This might seem obvious but small changes can affect this. Time of day for instance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Expansion and Contraction__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; If working indoors the sun might not be directly on the project initially. If left for many hours _after_, layers may dried with heat from direct sunlight that could make the balloon inside expand. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The opposite could apply as well. If the project was in direct sunlight while the layer was being applied it could have then cooled while it was still setting. When the base you are forming your project on moved it will set in unexpected ways (turning into a raisin). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The balloon shrinking is less of an issue after several layers. Having 2-3 already dried layers gives a good base so the balloon shrinking would be a non-issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This also could happen if you take the balloon outside for example to have it set faster. A change in the environment while the balloon is drying is likely causing this to fail. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep the project in the same place and avoid changes in temperature. This is more crucial for the first few layers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A wrinkled balloon can usually be ignored by adding more layers assuming the project calls for it. As layers get added the imperfections are hidden. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Busted &quot;seem&quot; can also be fixed by patching with more papier mache. In the case of the pinata this might be less than ideal as it introduces a weak point. Setting layers with the paper strips perpendicular to each other can help fix that. &#xD;&#xA;" />

Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages according to what kind of paint you're using. The TL;DR is that **natural bristles are better for oil-based paint while synthetic bristles are better for water-based or latex paint**. For more details, see [this page](http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7647/which-paintbrush-should-you-use/). As a bonus, it also gives some information on the *shape* as well as the material of paintbrush bristles:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Bristle Shape:** Most paintbrushes available today are square-cut brushes. They're perfect for holding and laying paint onto virtually any surface. However, square-cut brushes don't provide as much control when painting into corners, up to adjacent surfaces, or along narrow edges or surfaces. For more precise control, use a sash brush, which has its bristles cut at a slight angle. Sash brushes are particularly well-suited for cutting in around the perimeter of a room.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Bristle Tips:** Better quality brushes have bristles with flagged, or split, ends. Flagged bristles hold more paint and spread paint more smoothly. Some brushes, especially sash brushes, have tipped ends, which should not be confused with flagged ends. Tipped brushes come to a point; they're not cut flat and straight, as is a standard brush.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Professional painters favor tipped brushes because they provide greater control and allow you to apply paint more precisely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More details on different types&#xD;&#xA;-&#xD;&#xA;[This list](http://www.dickblick.com/info/brushhair/) goes into more detail on the usages of synthetic and various types of natural bristles, although it doesn't distinguish between different types of synthetic material:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Badger**&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   For blending oil paint on canvas, Badger Hair is an age-old tradtion. It comes from various parts of the world and is more readily available than most animal hair, although the quality varies greatly. Badger hair is thickest at the point, and relatively thin at the root, so it has a distinctive &quot;bushy&quot; appearance.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: oil&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Camel Hair**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Camel Hair does not come from camels at all. It is found in watercolor and lettering brushes and usually is made of squirrel, goat, ox, pony or a blend of several hairs, depending on the desired softness and intended cost of the brush.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: lettering, tempera, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Hog Bristle**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Hog Bristle is obtained from hogs in several parts of the world, the most sought after coming from China. Bristle is unlike any other natural filler in that it forms a V-shaped split or &quot;flag&quot; at the tip and tends to have a natural curve. A brush with &quot;interlocked&quot; bristles, with the curves formed inward to the ferrule, has a natural resistance to fraying and spreads medium to thick paints smoothly and evenly. A selection of pure hog bristle brushes is recommended for oil and acrylic painting, and is a far less expensive alternative to good-quality softer hairs.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: acrylic, oil&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Kevrin/Mongoose Hair**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Kevrin/Mongoose Hair is strong, resilient, and makes a good long-wearing, medium to professional quality brush for oil and acrylic painting.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: acrylic, oil&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Kolinsky Sable**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Kolinsky Sable is not really from a sable at all, but comes from the tail of a species of mink that is a member of the weasel family found in Siberia and northeastern China. It is generally conceded to be the best material for oil and watercolor brushes due to its strength, spring and ability to retain its shape (&quot;snap&quot;). It holds a very fine point or edge. This is considered a professional grade of hair, and if properly cared for, Kolinsky will last for many years.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA, oil, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Ox Hair**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   The best quality comes from the ears of cattle or oxen. The Ox Hair has a very strong body with silken texture, is very resilient, has good &quot;snap&quot;, but lacks a fine tip. Therefore, it is most useful in medium gradewash brushes, or flat shaped brushes. Frequently, ox hair is blended with other natural hair to increase the resiliency of a brush.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: lettering, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Pony Hair**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Pony Hair is soft but strong, from mature animals at least 2 years of age. It is primarily used for scholastic grade brushes, but often blended with other hairs for inexpensive watercolor and touch-up brushes.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: acrylic, scholastic, tempera, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Red Sable**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Red Sable is obtained from any member of the weasel family with &quot;red&quot; hair, not at all from the animal known as the sable. It is found in a variety of brush styles for many varied mediums, with quality and characteristics varying greatly. A good quality pure Red Sable is a good alternative to the more expensive Kolinsky, with similar performance and durability. Often, weasel hair is blended with ox hair to make a more economical brush, but the fine point is sacrificed.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: oil, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Sabeline**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Sabeline is actually select, light-colored ox hair dyed to resembled red sable. Lettering and watercolor brushes often use Sabeline mixed with Sable to lower the cost of a brush.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: lettering, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Squirrel**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Gray Squirrel (Talayoutky), most highly in demand for lettering brushes and quills, is native to Russia and nearly always fell in short supply. Brown squirrel (Kazan) is more readily available, and is used mainly for medium quality and scholastic watercolor brushes. A very fine, thin hair, taken from squirrel tails, it points as well as Kolinsky, but has very little &quot;snap&quot; because the hair is not very resilient. It works best with liquid paints and inks.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: lettering, watercolor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - **Synthetic**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   Synthetics are man-made of either nylon or polyester filaments. They can be tapered, tipped, flagged, abraded or etched to increase color carrying ability. Often, synthetic filaments are dyed and baked to make them softer and more absorbent. The common name for this filament is &quot;Taklon&quot;. Advantages of synthetic brushes are: 1) They are less prone to damage from solvents, insects or paints. 2) They are easier to keep clean than animal hair brushes because the filaments don't have animal scale structures to trap paint. 3) They are less prone to breakage and are durable on many different surfaces. 4) They are better suited for painting with acrylics because a synthetic filament will withstand the caustic nature of acrylic paints with less damage.&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;   MEDIA: all&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, [this list](http://www.gordonbrush.com/material_descriptions.php) goes into even greater detail on a huge variety of types of bristle, falling into four main families: **animal hair**, **vegetable fibre**, **synthetic**, and **wire brush**. Within each of these families, several different materials are described and compared. It's too long to copy it all here, but should be useful as further reading if the above isn't detailed enough." />

You can find detailed instructions [here](http://www.everything-stained-glass.com/stained-glass-making.html) on how to use [lead came](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Came). Alternatively, you can just use a different kind of paint, which is essentially glass-staining paint of the same kind as above except opaque and in a black or dark grey colour:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![leading paint][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/m1LgK.jpg" />

A Song of Water and Fire&#xD;&#xA;  -&#xD;&#xA;  This method assumes you have a tool with which to score the glass, for instance a glass drill bit or [glass cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_cutter), both of which should be reasonably inexpensive to get hold of. First use this to mark the line along which you want to cut the bottle. Then **apply heat to this line**; you can do this in a couple of different ways:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - by rotating the bottle slowly over an open flame, making sure the flame is directly under the score line so that it doesn't heat too broad an area of the bottle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - by pouring a thin stream of boiling water onto the score line from above, again trying not to let it cover too wide an area&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  After heating the bottle up along the score line, **dunk it in a pail of cold water** (which you should have prepared beforehand). The shock of passing from heat to cold should weaken the bottle and make it likely to crack along the existing score line.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  It's likely that the bottle won't break the first time you do this, but keep repeating the process multiple times (heat, cold water, heat, cold water) and eventually the bottle should snap in the right place.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. String and nail polish remover&#xD;&#xA;  -&#xD;&#xA;  Again the basic idea is to alternate extreme heat with extreme cold, but this time you don't need to have a scoring tool because you'll be using a piece of string. You also need something containing [acetone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone), the most commonly used example being nail polish remover.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Take a piece of string, **soak it in nail polish remover** (or anything else acetoney), and wrap it around the place where you want to cut the bottle. Then **set the string on fire**, which will apply intense heat to the narrow area on the bottle around where the string is tied. (Obviously, you need to take care that the string doesn't slip to a different position on the bottle. Even more obviosuly, make sure you don't have any of the acetone on your fingers and that the bottle of nail polish remover is placed well away from the flame.) When the flame burns out or you feel enough heat has been applied, **dunk the bottle in a pail of cold water** as before to provide the stress necessary to crack it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Again, this is unlikely to work the first time, but you can keep repeating the process, either re-soaking the string to light it again or replacing it by a new piece of string if necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whichever method you use, the bottle may not snap completely cleanly, so you should use some sandpaper to smooth off the edge of the broken bottle before using it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can see pictures and videos of the process [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-cut-a-bottle-with-string-and-nail-polish-re/?ALLSTEPS) and [here](http://www.wikihow.com/Cut-a-Glass-Bottle). I'll try to add some images and hopefully gifs to this answer later on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;There's also an urban myth that you can cut glass underwater with just an ordinary pair of scissors. I'm not sure whether or not this is true, and I haven't gone to research it, simply because it wouldn't be relevant for your problem anyway. A rigid object in the shape of a hollow cylinder can't be cut with a pair of scissors whatever material it's made of; the underwater cutting, it true, would only work for flat panes of glass.&lt;/sub&gt;" />

Using the side of the jig as a tool rest you can rotate the bottle with one hand while using the other to set the cutting pressure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Commercial products__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are several commercial products that can do this as well if you are more comfortable. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Small apparatus that you can buy][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In use it would look like this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have glass cutting experience but have never used a product like that.

This is surprisingly easy with some boiling water and cold tap water. You basically need to rapidly change the temperature of the glass near the score. You don't need extreme temperature for this though. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This likely has to be repeated a couple of times. Pour over boiling water slowly and rotate the bottle while pouring. After about 10 seconds of this you can take the bottle to the cold water from the tap. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The change in temperature should put enough stress on the bottle and it should fall apart.

But you can use this to your advantage. For example, you can use the pan colors for light washes, and use the more concentrated tube colors for adding outlines and details. To someone who doesn't know what kind of paint you used, it'll just look like you used more water in some parts and less water in other parts (and if you come right down to it, that'll be exactly what you did).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there is a huge disparity in quality between the types of paint - for example, if the pan colors are a dollar-store find meant for children, while the tubes are top-of-the-line artist's grade - that difference will probably be apparent in the finished product: the lower quality paints will look washed-out and chalky, and may be under-bound (so they come right off the paper when dry). But if both types are student-grade or better, then a competent artist will have no trouble creating a seamless piece of art using both types.

You need to use a paper that is designed to withstand watercolor techniques such as washes and blending, which pretty much means using the heaviest-weight watercolor paper you can afford, or using a lighter weight and investing in the equipment to stretch it as it dries. Either way, though, a paper that tears when wet will not cut it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And if you're doing neither sketching nor watercolors, but, say, pen and ink drawings, neither sketch paper nor watercolor paper will be particularly satisfactory.

You can laminate the plastic sheet to foil with spray adhesive if it doesn't hold shape or creases well enough for you on its own. Typical foil papers and home-made tissue foil probably won't do what you want, because the foil layer is typically very thin, and can break along the folds and expose the paper fibers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't mind losing edge definition, you could just fold out of paper, and then rubberize the pieces by dipping/spraying them with the rubber dip they make for coating tool handles (e.g., clear Plasti Dip).

You want maximum surface area contact. So the items will need to be cleaned of debris and loose components (like smaller rock fragments or shell shards).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rocks are going to be contoured and shells have a variety of shapes. Not only that but 2 part epoxy (and many other glues known for strength) need time to cure or set in order to get a sustaining bond. Pressure is required and clamps or weight perform that duty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So make sure everything is clean and you have a way to put pressure on the glue joint so that it does not move while it is setting. I cannot offer specific advice beyond that since rocks and shells, like I said before, are full of variety. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you wanted _something_ to go on I would build up walls of books, or other items of similar height,  beside the object you're gluing so you would not have to try and balance weight on top.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I always found hot glue to be temporary when crafting so I usually reserve it to kids crafts.

Here are some tips from my experience:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding the cutting tool itself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* First of all, envelopeners are consumables: they will become blunt over time and there's not much you can do about it. Since they are cheap, simply replace them once in a while, especially if you start running into issues more often than you used to. Your mileage may vary depending on how often and what types of paper you cut, but mine last less than half a year.&#xD;&#xA;* The blade which sits inside the tool is pressed between two halves of the plastic case. You can open the case by inserting a fingernail or a screwdriver blade into the narrow gap between the two halves. This will allow you to:&#xD;&#xA;    * Clean the blade from paper residue which gathers around it. Some envelopeners have a shaft which is supposed to allow the lint to escape from the blade but this does not always work perfectly.&#xD;&#xA;    * When closing the case, press the two pieces of the case firmly together. Sometimes the two halves become a little loose, causing the blade to not be mounted in a fully symmetric manner, which can cause both parts of the paper to move around a single side of blade instead of getting the blade exactly in between them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the cutting technique:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The envelope opener works best if the crease along which you cut is perpendicular to the paper edge. So, it's good for cutting squares but much worse for cutting hexagons. Personally, I use a Swiss Army knife or scissors for cutting hexagons since the envelopener doesn't handle them well.&#xD;&#xA;* Sometimes you run into problems such as splitting the sheet into layers instead of cutting along the edge when trying to cut thick paper and the crease along which you cut is pressed too firmly (e.g. using a bone folder). So, sometimes it helps to either not make the crease that sharp, or to fold it in the reverse direction after folding, which also results in a somewhat less sharp fold.&#xD;&#xA;* As mentioned above, an envelope opener consists of two plastics casing parts with the blade fixed in the middle right between them. These two halves of the case do not always perfectly fit together and there may be a small gap between them. Sometimes when you start cutting, you may press the paper too deep inside the casing, which causes the creased part of the paper to get stuck in this narrow gap. The solution is to check that you are not inserting the paper too deep.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While these tips do not guarantee a 100% success rate, and I still occasionally make a bad cut, I think that I have become better at using the envelopener over time, so I hope they are helpful for others, too." />

As a rule of thumb, something that uses a 16×16 grid will usually be simpler than something based around an 48×48 grid.&#xD;&#xA;* The complexity of line intersections in the CP may indicate how many layers of paper there are in different parts of the model which in turn may indicate the complexity to fold. So intersections where a larger number of creases meet may indicate a more complex model. There will, of course be exceptions, as a simple mountain fold over multiple layers may have the same CP (except for fold orientation) as a complex closed sink along the same line.&#xD;&#xA;* Look at the finished model. The amount of detail will often indicate the complexity. Bad surprises do happen, however.&#xD;&#xA;* Look around forums for people writing about the model — either the folders themselves or people commenting their work will often mention the model's complexity, especially if it is high. Don't be afraid to ask, either.&#xD;&#xA;* Get some experience by folding simple designs first. Even if you do not intend to fold tessellations in the future, they may be a good starting point into Crease Patterns since tessellations are often published in the form of CPs but at the same time the complexity of these CPs is usually much lower than that of animal model CPs. As you gain experience by folding simple Crease Patterns, you will become more proficient in judging the complexity of a CP." />

Folding along such an embossed line results in a relatively smooth fold even if the curve is complex.&#xD;&#xA;* For some models (mostly the organic-looking ones), wet folding can allow very smooth lines to be folded. This is sometimes combined with scoring the paper using your fingernails. Daniel Chang uses such a technique for folding his realistic human faces.&#xD;&#xA;* Robert J. Lang famously uses a laser tool to score the crease pattern into the paper. I was able to fold from such paper in one of his workshops and the scored line looks a row of tiny perforations which weaken the paper and guide your hand when you fold along the line.&#xD;&#xA;* Some folders (e.g. Ekaterina Lukasheva) use digital plotter-like tools for embossing the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Machine-embossed lines (the latter two examples) are of course much more precise than those made by hand, but even a line manually scored using a ball point pen can be surprisingly precise." />

Thick watercolor paper can absorb a lot of water and still stay intact while copy paper will disintegrate or at least tear with even a little moisture. This behavior depends on the paper's thickness, fibre length and sizing. Most wet folding tips found on the web (e.g. about using a spray bottle) apply to thicker paper and not to copy paper. Personally, I have never been able to wet fold copy paper and be happy about the result - it comes apart with even very little water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, first of all, I suggest you get some watercolor paper, 160-300 gsm for a start. Such papers are widely available in artist supply stores and not terribly expensive. Canson Mi-Teintes is a popular brand that comes in many colors but others should do as well. Then, retry your folding sequence and you should see a huge difference compared to copy paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The exact amount of water to use is unfortunately a matter of practice, but when I started wet folding, I always used too much rather than too little. It is easier to re-moisten paper than to dry it quickly, so better start with a smaller amount. You have to remoisten as you fold anyway. For most models, your paper should be damp but not soaking. While 160 or 300 gsm paper feels very stiff and almost not foldable at all when dry, with the right amount of water added it should feel leathery and be able to roll along a smooth curve easily. For some models, you only moisten a certain area of the paper at a time rather than the whole sheet. Also note that moisture takes some time to penetrate the paper, so you should wait a few seconds before applying moisture and checking if the paper has the right properties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The rest is a matter of experience, so start with thicker paper and give it a try once more." />

Traditional pigments can vary hugely in price depending on the source and although there are inexpensive synthetic equivalents of any colour you might want specific pigments may be desirable for more subtle and specific qualities of transparency and luminosity. One example is real ultramarine which is made from ground lapis lazuli and is very expensive indeed, the dry pigment powder almost seems to glow in daylight.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More traditional pigments may also be desirable for reasons or historical authenticity or for reproducing specific techniques and effects. A lot of mineral pigments are metal oxides and may be toxic and so tend to be much more expensive to process and get hold of in the context of modern consumer safety regulations.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practice this often g=comes down to how the pigment itself reflects light. Many oil painting techniques rely on building up many semi-transparent layers to achieve sophisticated lighting effects, especially for things like skin tones and atmospheric effects which you obviously can't do if the paint has a lot of opaque filler.

Also the then clumped-together petals have a higher risk of staying moist too long and getting musty or moldy.&#xD;&#xA; - Flower buds will stay very compact, again with a risk of mold.&#xD;&#xA; - Not all colours dry well - whites and light yellows tend to develop brown spots, very dark reds become blackish. As a rule of thumb, colours get darker during drying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So a semi-open rose in a medium pink, orange or red is a good starting point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For drying, the main issue is to ensure a good airflow and low humidity. Cooler is actually often better than hot and humid. By all means, keep the flowers out of direct sunlight.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It might be tempting to take that bouquet and just hang it upside down (and it sometimes works), but taking it apart and hanging individual flowers is the safer way to go. Whether you use pieces of string or clip them with clothespins on your laundry rack is up to you. Also, think about removing the lower leaves, they tend to get in the way or crumble when arranging the dry flowers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some prefer to spray the blooms with hairspray or laquer, but while it preserves the colour, it can increase brittleness.

Methylcellulose (MC)-glued double and triple tissue and well as self-made tissue foil are very popular and relatively inexpensive materials for folding exactly the kind of models you describe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The situation is not hopeless, however. There are ready-made papers which may suit your needs, but you will usually have to pay dearly for the benefit of not having to prepare paper yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* For practice, Kraft paper is often very good. It is widely available, strong, and you can get it in a range of thicknesses, including thin (e.g. 40 gsm). It does not look too good, but its folding properties are quite nice and it is inexpensive. You can usually get some variant in a local art supply store and save on shipping fees. This kind of paper often comes in rolls in which case you can get large formats, even above 1 m, easily (you have to cut the square yourself in such case, though).&#xD;&#xA;* [Nicolas Terry Tissue Foil](http://www.origami-shop.com/en/origamipapertissuefoil60x60greenscrapbookingorigamishopcom-xml-219_346_349-1510.html) is a ready-to-use replacement for self-made tissue foil and seems to be thinner than what you can make yourself.&#xD;&#xA;* Various mulberry papers can be good for this sort of models. They are available online and sometimes in art supply stores (depending on where you live).&#xD;&#xA;* A broad range of Washi papers are suitable for complex models. Be careful, however as Washi can mean a lot of different things, from very thin to rather thick. Be sure to check the weight / thickness of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;* A number of hand made papers may be suitable but since they are all unique, and often do not even have an official weight rating, it may be hard to find the right one without touching it or having a qualified seller who knows origami choose one for you.&#xD;&#xA;* And of course at the high end there's some [Origamido available online](http://www.origami-shop.com/en/origamido-paper-xml-207_215_657_285-2000.html). That's what Robert Lang often uses for his best models, though it comes with a price tag of €13 per sheet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These were some specific paper types which may (or may not) fit your model. Note that each particular model may have different requirements on thickness and stiffness of the paper. For example, [Shuki Kato's elephant](https://www.flickr.com/photos/origami-artist-galen/23735114470/) can certainly be considered a complex model (196 steps) but it can be, and very often is, folded from Elephant Hide paper (110 gsm) which is an absolute no go for most insect models.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, think about a particular model. What you can do is search flickr or other places where lots of origami models are displayed for your model. People will often add the paper type and weight to the model's description and this can help you choose paper for your own folding. When you buy online at a specialist origami store, you can also ask the shop about particular paper's suitability for certain kinds of models. No one can guarantee you a good fold (it depends very much on your own work), but they can give you hints which paper may be good and which you should avoid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ilan Garibi has a series of [paper reviews on OrigamiUSA](https://origamiusa.org/thefold/keywords/278) where he has reviewed a number of commercially available papers. I have found these reviews to be very helpful when I started to get interested in origami papers myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, here are some properties of the paper you should look for. Generally, you want your paper to be thin, yet strong and crisp. In more detail, this means paying attention to:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Paper weight, usually expressed in gsm (grams per square meter). These values are only approximate ratings but they give you an idea of how thick the paper is. 80 gsm is the weight of standard copy paper and is too much for many complex models, for which you should look for 40-60 gsm paper. Some very fine papers used for insects go as low as 20 gsm. Elephant Hide, a thick and stiff paper, is rated at 110 gsm. Papers around 160-300 gsm are suitable for wet folding but hardly foldable dry.&#xD;&#xA;* Fibre types: hand-made papers have long fibres which is usually a good thing. Longer fibres make the paper stronger and make it behave better when you need to wet fold some detail.&#xD;&#xA;* Crispness: it should be possible to make a sharp, well-defined crease at exactly the place you want it and paper should hold the crease well. This is especially important for complex folds like sinks where you precrease a line and then collapse along it. Soft paper has its benefits too, but too soft may make folding difficult.&#xD;&#xA;* Aging: one of the reasons I started using better papers was I noticed I had to throw away a number of old models which had faded and become very ugly. If you invest a lot of time into folding a complex model, you want it to stay looking fresh for a long time. Chlorine-free and acid-free papers are expected to last longer than those with the extra additives. Hand made papers often avoid these chemicals and age quite well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [first paper review by Ilan Garibi](https://origamiusa.org/thefold/article/paper-review-1-elephant-hide) describes these and many more properties which affect how origami paper behaves when you fold it and which make it suitable or not for particular model types." />

Typical Kami paper (I assume this is what you mean by &quot;square origami paper stock&quot;) is rather thin which means it is easy for the outer, visible layer to become crumpled and embossed with the pattern of the layers below when you squeeze multiple layers together. An example is visible as a diagonal line on the yellow unit in the picture. Thin paper may also wrinkle and deform as you force the flaps inside pockets. In my opinion even plain colored copy paper is often better since it's somewhat thicker and stiffer. You could also try stiffer papers such as Tant or Elephant Hide. They will make it harder to leave marks on the paper as you move it around, but on the other hand the extra stiffness may make connecting the units even harder as it's harder to bend the units as you wrestle with them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other important aspect is technique. With tightly-knit models it is usually really hard to insert the last unit or two, so some level of imperfection is probably unavoidable. But there are some things you can do to reduce visible artifacts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Strive for more symmetry as you fold. Instead of just inserting the last flap into its pocket when everything else is already in place, try to close the last vertex where three modules meet in a single step. So instead of two tabs fully inserted and one not at all, try to start with a loose assembly where all three flaps are just barely inserted into their pockets. Then, slowly try to tighten it, inserting the flaps deeper and deeper, all at the same time and trying to keep is as symmetric as possible. At one point the flaps should snap and all fall into their positions simultaneously. This technique requires at least moderately stiff paper and might not work with Kami (but give it a try). It may require a lot of coordination but often this technique allows one to close corners which would be impossible to close by manipulating just a single flap.&#xD;&#xA;* When folding, sometimes you have to make inexact folds on purpose in order to accommodate paper thickness. Diagrams are sometimes drawn with &quot;perfect&quot;, zero-thickness paper in mind. Actual paper has non-negligible thickness and when you fold five layers, they are about ½ mm thick which can already be significant. So sometimes when you fold an edge to a point, you should actually fold a little bit before it so that it gets into the right place later when more paper layers accumulate.&#xD;&#xA;* Practice. Some tricks are just muscle memory and hard to explain to others but you will come up with such tricks yourself and develop techniques that suit you well as you fold more.&#xD;&#xA;* Cheat. Sometimes you can leave out the last flap by folding it back below the unit instead of into its pocket, and no one will notice. In a model with strong locks, one missing lock will not significantly affect the model's stability and may not be easy to spot visually, either." />

Here are some tips from my experience:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding the cutting tool itself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* First of all, envelopeners are consumables: they will become blunt over time and there's not much you can do about it. Since they are cheap, simply replace them once in a while, especially if you start running into issues more often than you used to. Your mileage may vary depending on how often and what types of paper you cut, but mine last less than half a year.&#xD;&#xA;* The blade which sits inside the tool is pressed between two halves of the plastic case. You can open the case by inserting a fingernail or a screwdriver blade into the narrow gap between the two halves. This will allow you to:&#xD;&#xA;    * Clean the blade from paper residue which gathers around it. Some envelopeners have a shaft which is supposed to allow the lint to escape from the blade but this does not always work perfectly.&#xD;&#xA;    * When closing the case, press the two pieces of the case firmly together. Sometimes the two halves become a little loose, causing the blade to not be mounted in a fully symmetric manner, which can cause both parts of the paper to move around a single side of blade instead of getting the blade exactly in between them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the cutting technique:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The envelope opener works best if the crease along which you cut is perpendicular to the paper edge. So, it's good for cutting squares but much worse for cutting hexagons. Personally, I use a Swiss Army knife or scissors for cutting hexagons since the envelopener doesn't handle them well.&#xD;&#xA;* Sometimes you run into problems such as splitting the sheet into layers instead of cutting along the edge when trying to cut thick paper and the crease along which you cut is pressed too firmly (e.g. using a bone folder). So, sometimes it helps to either not make the crease that sharp, or to fold it in the reverse direction after folding, which also results in a somewhat less sharp fold.&#xD;&#xA;* As mentioned above, an envelope opener consists of two plastics casing parts with the blade fixed in the middle right between them. These two halves of the case do not always perfectly fit together and there may be a small gap between them. Sometimes when you start cutting, you may press the paper too deep inside the casing, which causes the creased part of the paper to get stuck in this narrow gap. The solution is to check that you are not inserting the paper too deep.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While these tips do not guarantee a 100% success rate, and I still occasionally make a bad cut, I think that I have become better at using the envelopener over time, so I hope they are helpful for others, too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**UPDATE**: I summarized these tips and some more in [an article on my homepage](http://michal.kosmulski.org/origami/envelopener-origami-usage.html)" />

[This Rookie Mag tutorial][2] suggests using a little turpentine. Then you can use some sticks to marble the paint together. The tutorial linked has a special device made, but most demonstrations show someone using a single spare piece of plastic or wood to get it done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can get some really neat effects due to the way the oil repels the water. Adding drops of plain water to an area of paint will create a circle of empty space. Add a drop of paint inside it and you'll make a ring. You can repeat this to get as many nested rings as you'd like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are an amazing number of tutorials already out there to cover this, and a lot of different methods. If this technique is suitable for you, then you should be able to find a step-by-step guide that walks you through getting this done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;FYI, a similar technique is used for &quot;hydro dipping&quot;, a popular way to give a [tie dye effect on animal skulls][3]. The concept is the same, and so watching the many tutorial videos about it may help give you some idea of the requirements and capabilities of the technique.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_marbling&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.rookiemag.com/2013/01/diy-paper-marbling/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59NQdsUlISghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59NQdsUlISg" />

You'll want to make sure your fingertip is clean, and oil-free, so that you don't smudge it with something else. Then, you simply rub. The direction you rub can have an effect. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- If you have two parallel lines and rub following their direction, you won't get much blending between them. Instead, you'll end up just blurring the lines, instead of having sharp edges. This technique is often used to blur the curved lines when shading spheres, on of the most common shading practice exercises for beginners.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Blending at angles away from the lines will great a smudge of sorts that causes a gradation from the lines value to a light grey. The closer the lines, the less likely you'll run into greys. You can see this by just drawing a dark area on a blank page and smearing away, to see how your pencil and pencil pressure have affected it.&#xD;&#xA; - You need to avoid back-and-forth strokes if you want a gradation. Always start your stroke from the darkest value and move outward.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - You can also blend in circles or back and forth, which may be the most helpful for trying to get a single area to be one value that's smoothed out, so the strokes don't show.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Tools  &#xD;&#xA;Now, there's also tools made specifically for this, called [tortillons][1] and [blending stumps][2]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They're made of tightly-wound paper. Tortillons being less tight than stumps, likely hollow, and you can clearly see the layers of paper, like the tip of a [grease pencil][5]. Blending stumps are so tightly wound that the seem more like a solid chunk of the paper with a point sanded off.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3][![Tortillon and stump][6]][6]  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Left: Pic courtesy [rapidfireart.com][4].  &#xD;&#xA;Right: The top is the back end of the tortillon, where you you can see how it's layered and hollow. The back end of the stump is more stump!&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These give you much more precision over the blending. They come in many sizes, which makes them more adaptable than the five sizes of your fingers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A plus to these is that as they blend, they tend to pick up more of the graphite dust in their fibers, evenly spreading it around the area and getting dust off so you don't need to use a brush or air. Your finger will end up absorbing the graphite or charcoal, but will layer it and compress it from the pressure. These can lead to you smudging dark areas of light ones accidentally if you forget to clean up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The downside is that the tortillons don't really clean up, so if they get too much graphite built up, you'll only want to use them for matching values. To counter this, most tortillons you can purchase have the ability to peel away the outside layer. Failing that, you can use a sandpaper pad, similar to what you can use to sharpen a pencil, to rub off the rough edge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my experience, tortillons, both bought and homemade, tend to give a softer blend than stumps. I've made my own tortillons by wrapping up old drawing paper (possibly with a bad sketch on the inside) and taping the end seam. These homemade tortillons have given me the softest blends, as the dull point often frays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][7]][7]   &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;My homemade tortillon, not a weird cigarette. Notice the curved, feathery tip.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's a comparison of the four tools I mentioned, using an HB pencil:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][8]][8]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The first column is blending a solid area, mostly back and forth (not against the strokes, which would blend more evenly).&#xD;&#xA; - The stump and homemade tool hide the strokes the best, in this case.&#xD;&#xA;- The second column is a few tight lines, stroking along them. &#xD;&#xA; - Notice the finger smudged well outside it (oops!), and the others were more precise. However, the homemade one had much &quot;fuzzier&quot; edges, which can be nice.&#xD;&#xA;- The last column is gradating out from dark.&#xD;&#xA; - As you go down the column, you'll see each tool, in this case, was better and blending from the dark line, so there's not so much of a hard edge between the dark and light. &#xD;&#xA; - The other thing to notice is that the strokes are almost invisible on the finger patch, and much less visible on the homemade stick.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I didn't blend any two values together for this demo. You will probably not just lay down a single dark line and blend outward, like my last column. Instead, you'd create a gradation yourself by using pencil pressure and different hardness pencils, then blend those values together with your tool.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortillon&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(drawing)&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ML2V0m.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://rapidfireart.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_pencil&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/iDpUkm.png&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/AFcfum.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gzqy6.jpg" />

For example, the cut should be along the red lines of one of the picture below:  &#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3] [![enter image description here][4]][4] [![enter image description here][5]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm open for other cutting lines if it makes the process easier.

If you ever tried writing with a quill and ended up with a blotchy mess instead of some nice calligraphy, part of the reason was probably that you were writing on a horizontal surface, and thus were holding the pen pretty close to vertical. The closer to vertical the pen, the better the ink flows, but if the ink flows too quickly, you get blotches. If you raise your writing surface at an incline, your pen flattens out, and it's easier to write evenly and without blotches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the main reason for using a slanted surface is ergonomics: instead of curling your head over the paper and holding your pen (or other implement) in a death-grip, a slanted surface brings the paper closer to your face -- thus less neck fatigue -- and makes it easier to write/draw with your arm and shoulder instead of your wrist. (Note that the ergonomic advantage is easily lost if you don't sit at an appropriate distance -- too far and you'll need to bend in odd ways to reach, too close and you'll be cramping your elbow and shoulder.)" />

It is usefull to have a rather high value, because you will be able to erase or burnishing, without completely destroying your paper.

Thus a paper with more tooth, will be able to receive more layers. But it is possible to apply several layers on paper with less tooth, but your first will have to be very light, otherwise the paper will saturate fast. On the other hand if the paper is very rough, you will have a different finish than on a smooth surface.  &#xD;&#xA;For watercolor papers it depends of the denomiantion from the smoother to the rougher, you have : Hot press, Cold Press, Rough.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Illustration][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Acide free paper**&#xD;&#xA;--------------------  &#xD;&#xA;If you want a paper that last longer (less yellowing for example) you can use an acid free paper, but since you use student grade colored pencils, it not really necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Products**&#xD;&#xA;------------&#xD;&#xA;You can try some hot press watercolor paper, and maybe cold press if you feel like you can't layer as much as you wish.

They'll stick fairly well to both materials, though presumably not as well as epoxy sold as glue. You have a lot of contact area so the bond will be strong anyway.  A two part epoxy should be quite cheap - if you can get an appropriate size pack, and I'd expect curing over a few hours though you might be able to get quicker.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To have it as clear as possible, you need to make sure that you apply enough to fill the gap and get all the air out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've bonded two sheets of clear plastic (one acrylic, one unknown) using ordinary glue epoxy (i.e. not meant to be transparent). That was good but not good enough for your needs. It was very slightly milky, and it cured before I had time to make a jig that would apply enough so I had a few bubbles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is possible to sand and even polish (with fine wet-or-dry paper) cured epoxy, so it could be used to seal the edges as well.

Don't worry about masking or hiding the sketch. Make bold, dark outlines on purpose. Sketch the pattern you want in graphite, then draw the lines very dark (in graphite, or even ink). This does give the final result something of a &quot;coloring book&quot; feel, which may not be what you're wanting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Sketch outlines in the color of their section, or in some very light color (e.g. yellow, pale blue), instead of with graphite. This requires more planning of what colors will go in what part of the pattern.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Draw the outlines dark and bold, and put a second sheet of paper over top to trace those dark lines in the lighter colors of the final drawing. This is easier if you have a light board, but still possible even on a tabletop with sufficiently thin paper." />

Children's sets usually have bright, basic colors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, you may have some luck getting darker colors by layering what you have. Read up on [color theory][1] and combine colors to give the illusion of overall darker hues. The section on tints &amp; shades from the wiki article is particularly helpful, and includes reasoning as to why you should avoid darkening colors with black or lightening them with white:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It is common among some painters to darken a paint color by adding&#xD;&#xA;&gt; black paint—producing colors called shades—or lighten a color by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; adding white—producing colors called tints. However it is not always&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the best way for representational painting, as an unfortunate result&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is for colors to also shift in hue. [...] Lightening a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reds and oranges. Another practice when darkening a color is to use&#xD;&#xA;&gt; its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. purplish-red added to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; yellowish-green) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue, and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory" />

You don't want these material fragments stuck to your cutting instruments. Nor do you want the inside of the machine to be exposed to them.

When you go to put that mug together it will now be ~1/8&quot; smaller so the edges of the mugs won't line up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not the end of the world obviously. You can address this but cutting off center on your mugs. On one mug you could cut a kerfs width to the right of the cut line and the other a kerfs width to the left. This also means you could have to cuts extra mugs to get the pieces you need. This also assumes your level of perfection your are trying to achieve. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you are cutting make sure you cut slow.

This also means you could have to cuts extra mugs to get the pieces you need. This also assumes your level of perfection your are trying to achieve. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you are cutting make sure you cut slow. Make sure you cut slow as to not force the blade askew or cause any burning. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Conclusion__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it is doable with power tools but unless I am way off the mark there would be some work involved in getting the right environment to do this properly . If you are willing to concede on some degree of perfection and willing to practice I think hand tools might be the way to go like [Chris H suggests][6]. Several caveats above would still apply. You might, in either case, consider food safe grout to make up for any size consistencies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is still feasible though how I describe.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__Access to tools/workspace__&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are locations that are set up for you to have access to industrial tools. So if purchasing them outright is not in the budget or you are just curious to test; look for something like this in your area. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[TechShop][4] is one of these public workshops that, with a membership, gives you access to tools and work space. They have locations all across the United States (which is obviously not useful for all). There are other places like this that exist for the purpose of tool rental and tutorials beyond what you would get from something like a big box store. TechShop is just an example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/KLfSvm.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/KLfSv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/R3vRLm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/R3vRL.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/HZn7U.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/654/44&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiMurfOL8EM" />

With the cut-to-length skeins, you can remove a single strand of thread while leaving the rest of the skein intact.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Note that this method works best for perle cotton, i.e. the type of embroidery thread that's already twisted into, well, threads, instead of individual strands of floss. If you use it for stranded floss, you need to be careful to remove an entire six-strand thread at once, and only separate out the number of strands you want *after* you've removed it from the skein.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![antique skein winder with four arms][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A skein winder can be very useful for this purpose, but in a pinch, an appropriately-sized piece of cardboard can work just as well. You remove the paper from a skein, find the end, and re-wind the thread, either around the skein winder or around your cardboard. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When it's all wound, you tie a small piece of string around the threads at one of the arms (or one edge of the cardboard), and then you cut the skein in half opposite the tie. Now you can either twist the two halves together -- twist each part clockwise, then twist the parts together counter-clockwise -- or you can re-divide the skein into three parts and braid them together. Don't twist or braid too tightly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firmly tie off the ends of the braid/twist with an elastic, so it'll continue to hold together as the skein gets smaller. When you need a thread, grab it at the fold and pull it out. The skein will get all accordion-pleated and scary-looking as you're doing this, but it'll smooth right back out after you have your thread.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/71GBqm.png" />

An understanding of composition in general is going to be helpful, although outside the scope of this answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, certain techniques or media may be more helpful to practice with, if the end goal is this type of art: Drawing in general, inking or other practice to help with line weights, and making clean lines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Making clean lines can be achieved by learning how to use such tools as French curves, templates, stencils and compasses: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's an example of some French curves:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_art&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/469/24http://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/469/24&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/j3Fvqm.jpg" />

Loomis is a very well-known figure artist and illustrator with a variety of instructional books that are very helpful.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This construction, in drawing from the mind, is usually done by understanding some sort of system of proportions and then altering features to add character. Proportions would compare head height to width, or divide head height into sections to place features (seen in the images above), but it can get much more complex.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By understanding these general relationships of constructing a figure, you begin to see how real heads and faces compare and vary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One popular method of achieving this development of form is called **blocking-in**. You can see a quality example of [blocking-in using the Atelier method][3] at [GeorgetownAtelier.com][4].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can start your base block-in similar to drawing an initial outline. But, instead of just focusing on the silhouette, think about the form in 3D. The outline will guide you on the proportions to use as you develop your other planes and shapes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then slowly add details, keeping your sketch light. You can measure placements of features, such as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Where is the top arch of the eyebrow compare to the ears?&#xD;&#xA; - If you draw a straight vertical line on the side of the nostril wing, how far is the corner of the eye? (Or vice-versa)&#xD;&#xA; - Compared to the length of the nose, what's the distance between the tip of the nose to the bottom of the chin?&#xD;&#xA; - What degree of angle is it from the outside corner of the eye to the tip of the nose?&#xD;&#xA; -  - If you draw a straight vertical line on corner of the mouth, how does it compare to the center of the eye?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are pretty limited examples. The key to getting an accurate portrait of a real person is by getting the proportions and placements correct for *their* anatomy. Since you can start with height or width, you can scale the other dimensions based on that, and then scale every other proportion on others you know you did &quot;right&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The more you analyze the geometry, the more accurate you'll be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Measuring this way can be done with classical techniques such as [using your pencil as a measuring stick][5], which can also be aided by a [plumb line][6] for getting objective verticals. Or, if you working from a 2D source, such as a photo, you can take accurate measurements of distances and angles using rulers and protractors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/uUhzkm.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/thxZom.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://georgetownatelier.com/tutorials/introductory-tutorials/color-temperaturefigure-drawing-part-3/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://georgetownatelier.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.drawinghowtodraw.com/stepbystepdrawinglessons/2010/01/how-to-find-measurements-proportions-and-angles-to-draw-with-pencil-thumb-method/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://drawingacademy.com/use-of-plumb-line-in-drawing" />

Text="I would begin by constructing the form and mass of the head, as often seen in figure drawing construction:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Images from Andrew Loomis's &quot;Drawing the Head and Hands&quot;. Loomis is a very well-known figure artist and illustrator with a variety of instructional books that are very helpful.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This construction, in drawing from the mind, is usually done by understanding some sort of system of proportions and then altering features to add character. Proportions would compare head height to width, or divide head height into sections to place features (seen in the images above), but it can get much more complex.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By understanding these general relationships of constructing a figure, you begin to see how real heads and faces compare and vary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One popular method of achieving this development of form is called **blocking-in**. You can see a quality example of [blocking-in using the Atelier method][3] at [GeorgetownAtelier.com][4].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can start your base block-in similar to drawing an initial outline. But, instead of just focusing on the silhouette, think about the form in 3D. The outline will guide you on the proportions to use as you develop your other planes and shapes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then slowly add details, keeping your sketch light. You can measure placements of features, such as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Where is the top arch of the eyebrow compare to the ears?&#xD;&#xA; - If you draw a straight vertical line on the side of the nostril wing, how far is the corner of the eye? (Or vice-versa)&#xD;&#xA; - Compared to the length of the nose, what's the distance between the tip of the nose to the bottom of the chin?&#xD;&#xA; - What degree of angle is it from the outside corner of the eye to the tip of the nose?&#xD;&#xA; - If you draw a straight vertical line on corner of the mouth, how does it compare to the center of the eye?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are pretty limited examples. The key to getting an accurate portrait of a real person is by getting the proportions and placements correct for *their* anatomy. Since you can start with height or width, you can scale the other dimensions based on that, and then scale every other proportion on others you know you did &quot;right&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The more you analyze the geometry, the more accurate you'll be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Measuring this way can be done with classical techniques such as [using your pencil as a measuring stick][5], which can also be aided by a [plumb line][6] for getting objective verticals. Or, if you working from a 2D source, such as a photo, you can take accurate measurements of distances and angles using rulers and protractors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/uUhzkm.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/thxZom.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://georgetownatelier.com/tutorials/introductory-tutorials/color-temperaturefigure-drawing-part-3/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://georgetownatelier.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.drawinghowtodraw.com/stepbystepdrawinglessons/2010/01/how-to-find-measurements-proportions-and-angles-to-draw-with-pencil-thumb-method/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://drawingacademy.com/use-of-plumb-line-in-drawing" />

For the primer, try to find a paint that's specifically meant for plastic: you want something that's guaranteed to stick to the plastic, and then your gold adhesive will stick to the paint (or at least it should), and then the metal leaf will stick to the gold adhesive, and then (after everything has cured as fully as it ever will, but before oxidation has set in) seal the metal leaf both to protect it from abrasion and to prevent tarnishing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless of what specific steps you follow, you may end up with a phone case that's noticeably thicker than it was before. Make sure to mask off any areas that shouldn't get thicker, i.e. any prongs/thingamabobs that make the case stay on the phone, the inside of the case, the holes for the camera/power cord/headphones/switches and buttons, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other caveat is that, unlike IKEA furniture, your phone case is probably not flat. This means that you will be gilding around a curve, which is more difficult than just covering a rectangular flat area. You *will* end up with gaps, and even after doing your best to fill them in, you'll see the seams, and some gaps will just be too small to fill but not small enough to be invisible. (This is where genuine gold leaf would make things easier: it will stick to itself, allowing you to fill in gaps totally invisibly.) Depending on the effect you want to achieve, choose your primer and/or adhesive color to either contrast with the gold (a red Armenian bole color is traditional for this) or blend in as much as possible (i.e. yellow)." />

Test a relatively unimportant page to see before doing the whole book. Alcohol and water are very dangerous for leather and may cause it to blacken, so test in an inconspicuous place.

Be careful not to move it around too much, using masking tape to stick it to your desk if necessary. If you use tracing paper, you'll still be able to see where you're headed through the sheet, instead of blocking off your view of the piece as a whole. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also start to build up your hand control. The smudging happens, generally, because your drawing hand is resting completely on the paper. On a horizontal desk, this in natural, but leads to smudging. Instead of resting your hand on its whole side, try using one of your pinky knuckles as a the only place your hand touches the page. This will minimize contact with the paper and reduce the chance of smearing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're on an inclined desk or easel, you can change to an alternative drawing grip. The underhand grip, for instance, should keep your hand completely off the page. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other than that, I'd suggest just being careful about watching your hands. Making sure your drawing hand isn't making contact with the paper where you've already drawn while you're drawing, and that your free hand isn't gripping the page on the penciled parts. Change your paper or hand angle as necessary to do this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A note, pencils in the B range are softer and will smudge more and more obviously, so be extra careful with them. 4H and higher shouldn't smear very much at all, but they give you much lighter values. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you meant the smudge after you finish them, I would recommend you purchase some fixative spray. It can be used for graphite, charcoal and pastel. Essentially, it adds a protective layer over the piece. There's also fixatives to use while working on them. I have no idea about these, but [John Cavan does][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aerosol hair spray does the same in a pinch, but will damage your work over the long term. However, if you're just going to scan it or take a picture of it, you may not care.

If this was a little bit different then other options might be viable as well. Perhaps using Plasticine or silicone to create a mold of the void. It would allow you to trace around the mold you create and get a gauge on depth. Unless you plan on repeating this those options are not very efficient. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Cutting the veneer&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When creating the veneer you have a couple of options. You could cut out the shape from an existing veneer piece or cut your shape from larger stock and slice the veneer off of that. If you are just cutting preexisting veneer a craft knife might be enough. Warning if you go that route to not attempt to cut all way though at once. The knife could catch and follow the grain potentially ruining the cut. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A bandsaw would be a well rounded tool in either case. Using a fine tooth it will make easy work of the template and reduce the amount of sanding potentially required. Beware of the kerf when cutting your veneer. Cut outside the line you made. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Make your own veneer&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't have veneer or the veneer you have does not fit inside the void perfectly then you might have better luck cutting your own veneer (too large is fixable by sanding but too small is harder to recover from.). Use stock large enough so that you can maneuver around the bandsaw with your hand comfortably away from the blade. First, bring the fence ~0.5mm from the blade and push through. Consider making it a little thicker and sanding the face because I cannot tell from the photo if the wood is perfectly flat or contoured. With your new perfectly size veneer you can now cut it to shape.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Help prevent sanding an sizing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to get cleaner cuts on your veneer when using power tools like the bandsaw you can always sandwich the veneer inside some sacrificial wood. This will reduce the tear-out on the veneer to nothing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Pay attention to the direction of wood grain&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One major point about cutting your veneer is make sure the length of the shape you are making follows the grain of the wood. If you cut it against the grain is will weaken the wood making it easier to break in half. Notice the grain direction in one of the other partitions of the bracelet. You should cut the veneer the same. While it might be fine once set you will notice a difference if you are sanding it or maneuvering the veneer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Showing grain direction][2]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Click image to enlarge&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/1708/44&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/UZF7Hm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/UZF7H.jpg" />

This compresses/flattens the stitches which can make them look odd.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Taking the piece to a reputable framing shop is probably the best idea unless you make a lot of projects and want to learn how to do it yourself or if the project is relatively small. A good shop should know how to properly block the cloth to keep it square but check with them to be certain they have experience with this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The steps for framing yourself are generally laid out in an article [here][1] and a similar one [here][2]. The basic process is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Prepare the piece&#xD;&#xA;  - Wash the piece to remove oils - be careful of running colors, particularly if you didn't prewash the thread.&#xD;&#xA;  - Iron to remove wrinkles - from the back, on soft cloth to prevent flattening stitches.&#xD;&#xA; - Mount the piece. &#xD;&#xA;  - Block it onto an acid-free foam core board using straight pins, keeping some tension as you go around to keep the piece flat - use the lines of the fabric to help keep things straight.&#xD;&#xA;  - Fold the edges around the back of the foam and secure with pins or stitching.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At this point, they simply recommend putting it in a frame either with or without glass... but I strongly encourage you to go a couple of steps further.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I highly recommend glass as it will prevent incidental dust and oils from getting on the piece. You just spent hours making it - protect it! The glass (if you get UV glass), can prevent the piece from fading, which is very important as the dyes used may not all fade at the same rates. Reds are well known to fade more quickly than other colors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also recommend adding at least one matting layer to put some space between the work and the glass, again, to prevent the stitches from being flattened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.needlework-tips-and-techniques.com/framing-cross-stitch.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.artecy.com/framing-cross-stitch.html" />

Loomis is a very well-known figure artist and illustrator with a variety of instructional books that are very helpful.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This construction, in drawing from the mind, is usually done by understanding some sort of system of proportions and then altering features to add character. Proportions would compare head height to width, or divide head height into sections to place features (seen in the images above), but it can get much more complex.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By understanding these general relationships of constructing a figure, you begin to see how real heads and faces compare and vary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One popular method of achieving this development of form is called **blocking-in**. You can see a quality example of [blocking-in using the Atelier method][3] at [GeorgetownAtelier.com][4]. &lt;sub&gt;Depiction of bust of bare derriere in spoiler block, from that website.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;! [![enter image description here][5]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can start your base block-in similar to drawing an initial outline. But, instead of just focusing on the silhouette, think about the form in 3D. The outline will guide you on the proportions to use as you develop your other planes and shapes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then slowly add details, keeping your sketch light. You can measure placements of features, such as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Where is the top arch of the eyebrow compare to the ears?&#xD;&#xA; - If you draw a straight vertical line on the side of the nostril wing, how far is the corner of the eye? (Or vice-versa)&#xD;&#xA; - Compared to the length of the nose, what's the distance between the tip of the nose to the bottom of the chin?&#xD;&#xA; - What degree of angle is it from the outside corner of the eye to the tip of the nose?&#xD;&#xA; - If you draw a straight vertical line on corner of the mouth, how does it compare to the center of the eye?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are pretty limited examples. The key to getting an accurate portrait of a real person is by getting the proportions and placements correct for *their* anatomy. Since you can start with height or width, you can scale the other dimensions based on that, and then scale every other proportion on others you know you did &quot;right&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The more you analyze the geometry, the more accurate you'll be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Measuring this way can be done with classical techniques such as [using your pencil as a measuring stick][6], which can also be aided by a [plumb line][7] for getting objective verticals. Or, if you working from a 2D source, such as a photo, you can take accurate measurements of distances and angles using rulers and protractors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/uUhzkm.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/thxZom.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://georgetownatelier.com/tutorials/introductory-tutorials/color-temperaturefigure-drawing-part-3/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://georgetownatelier.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/jtBxQ.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.drawinghowtodraw.com/stepbystepdrawinglessons/2010/01/how-to-find-measurements-proportions-and-angles-to-draw-with-pencil-thumb-method/&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://drawingacademy.com/use-of-plumb-line-in-drawing" />

It would seem to be especially valuable when a drawing has so many elements as these do. Without compositional aides, a drawing could become a confusing visual blur or a flat pattern. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Decide what elements you want to focus on - the main idea. There can also be secondary foci, so that your eye moves across a drawing. In the lower drawing, with the birds and butterflies, romanticized flight/wings seem to be the theme here. The top butterfly and bird seem to be **focal point**s along with the bottom butterfly. The groupings **balance** each other, giving weight and focus to both the top and bottom of the drawing, in spite of the fancifully airy nature of the drawing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Techniques that add dimensional depth are clearly seen here. **Perspective** makes it appear as though the elements are spiraling downwards away from us and disappearing towards the center of the page. Perspective is summoned in several ways: overlapping, line weight, and the paleness of the more &quot;distant&quot; objects. When objects **overlap**, even in a drawing, our brains interpret the partially blocked objects as being behind the others and therefore, farther away. For example, on the outer edge of the drawing, rhododendron-like flowers overlap the vines. This makes the flowers pop towards us while in the center, one bird overlaps another. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The line weights vary across the drawing. Darker lines do two things here - they denote object boundaries in space and denote atmospheric perspective. Where a line marks the **boundary between an object and open space**, it's darker, like in the body outline of the upper right bird. Lines on the bird's body that relate detail, but are not free-standing in space, were given a lighter weight, as in the feathers. When you observe a panoramic landscape, you see that the lines (and colors) that are closer to you have more weight and vibrancy, while as space recedes, the lines and colors become less vibrant, more pale, and more greyed-out. This is called **atmospheric perspective**. Compare the heavy lies of those rhododendron-like flowers that pop out towards us with the soft, thin lines of the terminal tip of the vine at the center of the drawing. That tip fades into the distance, contributing to an impression of depth in the drawing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Proportion** also aides the impression of depth. Unfortunately, it's less obvious here. Two similar objects (species of bird, flower, or butterfly) should be about the same size unless one is &quot;farther away&quot; to it's twin. The only object that really does that here is the spiraling vine. Along the outer edge of the drawing, the vines are drawn with more line weight showing the boundary between solid and space, that they are closer to us than the terminal tip in the center is, and the diameter of those vines are proportionally thicker at the outer edge than those tender terminals that seem farther away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This link provides a brief discussion of common compositional concepts: [&quot;Drawing for Dummies&quot;][1] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-design-elements-of-composing-a-drawing.html" />

So I'd simply use a knife with tooth (&quot;couteau dentelé&quot; in french). Something like this one:  &#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]  &#xD;&#xA;and saw the straw with it. Pay attention to really use the sawing part of the knife (this is why the tooth are important), i.e. don't press too strong the knife against the straw to make sure that you don't break it. You can then smooth the edges of your cut again by using some kind of heating process. In this case, I would even consider having a very hot surface and then simply press (as vertically as possible) the extremal points of your straw on the surface. Ideally, you have a pencil ready to put it in the straw when the plastic is soft and make sure that the hole is not obstructed by the plastic. &#xD;&#xA;I'm pretty sure this should work well. In fact, you could also use this knife to get third type of holes in straw (my guess is that different holes will lead to different sounds).&#xD;&#xA; - Solution 2: This is based on a surprising experiment I made one evening by pure interest. And actually you could consider merging some ideas of this solution with Solution 1. The experiment was easy, take a plastic glass fill it with water and try to make a whole in the glass with a lighter to empty some water: impossible. The plastic above the water will melt exactly until the water level is reached and afterward, no way to go further... (maybe with a blowtorch it could work but this is not the goal here). Moreover, the melted plastic tends to curl outside the glass and does clearly not go where the water is. So you can use this phenomenon at your advantage: Indeed you could stuck one side of the straw (with a chewing gum or something similar), fill it with water at the level you wish and melt the remaining part. If you have to melt 2/3 of your straw this will eventually be long and smoky (and this are the kind of smokes your lungs really want to avoid). So, I would consider first cutting the main part with a knife and then make the last 3-5 millimeters in this way in order to get a very smooth result.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**For the holes:**    (to make a regular flute)  &#xD;&#xA;Actually I misread the question at first (and forgot about the &quot;pan&quot; part of your flute), so these solutions can be useful if you want to build a regular flute with several holes in the same straw (which IMO could also be an interesting option to consider).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; -   Solution 1: Consider a tool like this one (an awl):  &#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Hold the extremity above a candle and then make your hole. The heat should (locally) soften the plastic and make a relatively neat hole. Just pay attention to retain your move in order to avoid piercing both sides of the straw :). Note that you could also put something in the straw to stop the awl on the midway. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; -  Solution 2: Another way could be to use sand paper rolled. I would wrap a pencil with sandpaper and use it to make the whole. The advantage is that the whole will be even more clean however you'll get a kind of ellipsoidal hole (which might change the sound of your instrument) and you can certainly not make as small holes as with Solution 1. Another relatively small drawback is that this is very sand paper consuming. Indeed, my experience, is that when rubbing with sandpaper, the plastic will melt a bit on your sandpaper which makes it quickly unusable (but at least sandpaper is quite cheap). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Solution 3: Use the same knife as in the first part of this answer and cut some &quot;V&quot;'s in your straw, something like that (cut along the red lines):&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; you will get a third type of holes. The problem however (as well as the solution with sandpaper but even worst) is that the different holes will likely be different from each other, so unless you have some other tools to make sure that the cut will be exactly at 45° and not pass the half of the straw, I would avoid this solution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/HfDBOm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/fDOkem.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/WOiMB.png" />

So I'd simply use a serrated knife. Something like this one:  &#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]  &#xD;&#xA;and saw the straw with it. Pay attention to really use the sawing part of the knife (this is why the teeth are important), i.e. don't press the knife too firmly against the straw to make sure that you don't break it. You can then smooth the edges of your cut again by using some kind of heating process. In this case, I would even consider having a very hot surface and then simply press (as vertically as possible) the end points of your straw on the surface. Ideally, you have a pencil ready to put it in the straw when the plastic is soft and make sure that the hole is not obstructed by the plastic. &#xD;&#xA;I'm pretty sure this should work well. In fact, you could also use this knife to get third type of holes in straw (my guess is that different holes will lead to different sounds).&#xD;&#xA; - Solution 2: This is based on a surprising experiment I made one evening by pure interest. And actually you could consider merging some ideas of this solution with Solution 1. The experiment was easy, take a plastic glass fill it with water and try to make a whole in the glass with a lighter to empty some water: impossible. The plastic above the water will melt exactly until the water level is reached and afterward, no way to go further... (maybe with a blowtorch it could work but this is not the goal here). Moreover, the melted plastic tends to curl outside the glass and does clearly not go where the water is. So you can use this phenomenon at your advantage: Indeed you could stuck one side of the straw (with a chewing gum or something similar), fill it with water at the level you wish and melt the remaining part. If you have to melt 2/3 of your straw this will eventually be long and smoky (and this are the kind of smokes your lungs really want to avoid). So, I would consider first cutting the main part with a knife and then make the last 3-5 millimeters in this way in order to get a very smooth result.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**For the holes:**    (to make a regular flute)  &#xD;&#xA;Actually I misread the question at first (and forgot about the &quot;pan&quot; part of your flute), so these solutions can be useful if you want to build a regular flute with several holes in the same straw (which IMO could also be an interesting option to consider).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; -   Solution 1: Consider a tool like this one (an awl):  &#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Hold the extremity above a candle and then make your hole. The heat should (locally) soften the plastic and make a relatively neat hole. Just pay attention to retain your move in order to avoid piercing both sides of the straw :). Note that you could also put something in the straw to stop the awl on the midway. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; -  Solution 2: Another way could be to use sand paper rolled. I would wrap a pencil with sandpaper and use it to make the whole. The advantage is that the whole will be even more clean however you'll get a kind of ellipsoidal hole (which might change the sound of your instrument) and you can certainly not make as small holes as with Solution 1. Another relatively small drawback is that this is very sand paper consuming. Indeed, my experience, is that when rubbing with sandpaper, the plastic will melt a bit on your sandpaper which makes it quickly unusable (but at least sandpaper is quite cheap). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Solution 3: Use the same knife as in the first part of this answer and cut some &quot;V&quot;'s in your straw, something like that (cut along the red lines):&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; you will get a third type of holes. The problem however (as well as the solution with sandpaper but even worst) is that the different holes will likely be different from each other, so unless you have some other tools to make sure that the cut will be exactly at 45° and not pass the half of the straw, I would avoid this solution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/HfDBOm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/fDOkem.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/WOiMB.png" />
