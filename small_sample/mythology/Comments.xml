Symbols on amulets or elsewhere, or other items, that are used in the stated regions to ward off the possibility of harm that would otherwise be so caused, and that are related to the symbols used in the Mediterranean region for that purpose, are relevant whether or not connected with witchcraft. Curses express a wish for harm, usually verbally, but if some involve a malevolent look then the same applies." CreationDate="2016-06-03T23:49:08.700" UserId="1637" />

The side of an instance of it shown on the left of [this image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Benedict_Medal#/media/File:Benediktusmedaille.jpg), from the medal's Wikipedia page, uses both light blue and dark blue, as do the hamsa and the nazar, so it might be related. St Benedict's halo also seems sometimes to be enclosed in part of another circle. I do not know whether users sometimes conceive that they are using it to ward off malevolent looks. If a case has been made, or could be made, it would make a very interesting answer." CreationDate="2016-06-04T00:03:16.770" UserId="1637" />
