According to Wiki, the sword is called  Calabrum, Callibourc, Chalabrun, and Calabrun (with alternate spellings such as Chalabrum, Calibore, Callibor, Caliborne, Calliborc, and Escaliborc).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chretien de Troyes wrote, in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceval,_the_Story_of_the_Grail&quot;&gt;Perceval&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, (again in the 12th Century), of a sword called &lt;strong&gt;Escalibor&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Excalibor&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robert de Boron (late 12th/early 13th Century), in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin#Later_adaptations_of_the_legend&quot;&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, wrote of the &lt;strong&gt;Sword in the Stone&lt;/strong&gt;, and the idea of only the &quot;one true king&quot; being able to retrieve the sword. It isn't confirmed that this sword is Excalibur, but later versions took this story and called the sword Excalibur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later, in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Vulgate_Cycle&quot;&gt;Post-Vulgate Cycle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (13th Century), French writers attempted to bring together some of the scenes and characters of the legends (Wiki calls it a &quot;rehandling of the earlier Vulgate Cycle&quot;). In this version, the sword is called &lt;strong&gt;Excalibur&lt;/strong&gt;, and is given to Arthur by the &lt;strong&gt;Lady of the Lake&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur&quot;&gt;Le Morte d'Arthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by Thomas Malory, he gives both versions, and calls both &lt;strong&gt;Excalibur&lt;/strong&gt;. Arthur receives the sword three different times in &lt;em&gt;Le Morte&lt;/em&gt;, in three different ways (the stone, the lake and once in a battle). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, according to the 15th Century &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliterative_Morte_Arthure&quot;&gt;Alliterative Morte Arthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, there is a sword called &lt;strong&gt;Clarent&lt;/strong&gt;, a fragile sword designed for ceremonial purposes rather than fighting. The internet (though I haven't found an original source for this yet) associates this with being the &lt;strong&gt;Sword in the Stone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there isn't a clear answer. The stories evolved quite a bit, and the sword that some writers took to be Excalibur was taken by others to mean Clarent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it does seem that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Excalibur and Caliburn &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; seem to be the same sword.

Isiodus doesn't say why hope stayed into the jar, but one (judging from Isiodus' view on women) can imply that  he meant by that, that the men would have no hope against women, for without her, they would die alone, but with her, they'd have to withstand their cunning nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Judging by this, which is how Hesiod closes &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theogony&quot;&gt;Theogony&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Thus it is not possible to escape the mind of Zeus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msu.edu/~tyrrell/theogon.pdf&quot;&gt;Theogony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;an angry Zeus decides to give humanity a punishing gift to compensate for the boon they had been given.

Number 11 is not divisible, number 10 only has two factors (2 and 5) meaning that if you measure anything in tens, you can only divide it into either halves or pairs. Number 9 only divides into 3, number 8 only into 2 and 4, number 7 is a prime number with no factors, number 6 only breaks down into half or thirds, number 5 is a prime, you can only halve number 4 or 2, and 3 and 1 don't divide and are so small you wouldn't want to measure things in them, anyway. &lt;strong&gt;Number 12, however, divides into 6, 4, 3 and 2, giving it a large number of practical uses where things have to be divided up into whole numbers, from calendars to clocks.&lt;/strong&gt; As a result of all these factors, mathematicians get excited about the number 12 and apparently, they always have done!

When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint.

Roman poets placed them on an island called Sirenum scopuli. In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the &quot;flowery&quot; island of Anthemoessa, or Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae. All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When the Sirens were given a parentage they were considered the daughters of the river god Achelous, fathered upon Terpsichore, Melpomene, Sterope, or Chthon (the Earth; in Euripides' Helen 167, Helen in her anguish calls upon &quot;Winged maidens, daughters of the Earth&quot;). Although they lured mariners, for the Greeks the Sirens in their &quot;meadow starred with flowers&quot; were not sea deities. Roman writers linked the Sirens more closely to the sea, as daughters of Phorcys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Their number is variously reported as between two and five. In the Odyssey, Homer says nothing of their origin or names, but gives the number of the Sirens as two.

Loki comes a third time and this time bites Brokkr on the eyelid even harder. The bite is so deep that it draws blood. The blood runs into Brokkr's eyes and forces him stop working the bellows just long enough to wipe his eyes. This time, when Sindri returns, he takes Mjöllnir out of the forge.

They recited poetry to each other, then they hit each other, and both of them fell dead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaytān - They are noted for being smart, cunning and powerful.

He was of the stock of bronze, of the men sprung from ash-trees, the last left among the sons of the gods; and the son of Cronos gave him to Europa to be the warder of Crete and to stride round the island thrice a day with his feet of bronze. Now in all the rest of his body and limbs was he fashioned of bronze and invulnerable; but beneath the sinew by his ankle was a blood-red vein; and this, with its issues of life and death, was covered by a thin skin. So the heroes, though outworn with toil, quickly backed their ship from the land in sore dismay. And now far from Crete would they have been borne in wretched plight, distressed both by thirst and pain, had not Medea addressed them as they turned away:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hearken to me.

And with songs did she propitiate and invoke the Death-spirits, devourers of life, the swift hounds of Hades, who, hovering through all the air, swoop down on the living. Kneeling in supplication, thrice she called on them with songs, and thrice with prayers; and, shaping her soul to mischief, with her hostile glance she bewitched the eyes of Talos, the man of bronze; and her teeth gnashed bitter wrath against him, and she sent forth baneful phantoms in the frenzy of her rage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Father Zeus, surely great wonder rises in my mind, seeing that dire destruction meets us not from disease and wounds alone, but lo! even from afar, may be, it tortures us! So Talos, for all his frame of bronze, yielded the victory to the might of Medea the sorceress. And as he was heaving massy rocks to stay them from reaching the haven, he grazed his ankle on a pointed crag; and the ichor gushed forth like melted lead; and not long thereafter did he stand towering on the jutting cliff. But even as some huge pine, high up on the mountains, which woodmen have left half hewn through by their sharp axes when they returned from the forest—at first it shivers in the wind by night, then at last snaps at the stump and crashes down; so Talos for a while stood on his tireless feet, swaying to and fro, when at last, all strengthless, fell with a mighty thud. For that night there in Crete the heroes lay; then, just as dawn was growing bright, they built a shrine to Minoan Athena, and drew water and went aboard, so that first of all they might by rowing pass beyond Salmone's height.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Argonautica, by Apollonius Rhodius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="57" LastEditorUserId="57" LastEditDate="2015-05-01T11:28:11.847" LastActivityDate="2015-05-01T11:28:11.847" CommentCount="0" />

She knew they were not vapours from the river, or breath from the damp earth. She looked around to see where her husband was, knowing by now the intrigues of a spouse so often caught in the act. When she could not find him in the skies, she said ‘Either I am wrong, or being wronged’ and gliding down from heaven’s peak, she stood on earth ordering the clouds to melt. Jupiter had a presage of his wife’s arrival and had changed Inachus’s daughter into a gleaming heifer. Even in that form she was beautiful. Saturnia approved the animal’s looks, though grudgingly, asking, then, whose she was, where from, what herd, as if she did not know. Jupiter, to stop all inquiry, lied, saying she had been born from the earth. Then Saturnia claimed her as a gift. What could he do? Cruel to sacrifice his love, but suspicious not to. Shame urges him to it, Amor urges not. Amor would have conquered Shame, but if he refused so slight a gift as a heifer to the companion of his race and bed, it might appear no heifer!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women themselves were almost never interested, and so he transformed himself to make them more willing.

But some say that Helen was a daughter of Nemesis and Zeus; for that she, flying from the arms of Zeus, changed herself into a goose, but Zeus in his turn took the likeness of a swan and so enjoyed her; and as the fruit of their loves she laid an egg, and a certain shepherd found it in the groves and brought and gave it to Leda; and she put it in a chest and kept it; and when Helen was hatched in due time, Leda brought her up as her own daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, for one or the other of these reasons, Zeus pretty much had no choice, if he wanted to keep raping every beautiful woman he met.

Since he lives beneath it, the Tree can be called his. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, metaphorically speaking, Lif and Lifthrasir, are precious treasures, gathered together and hidden underground like a seed which lies dormant through the winter waiting for spring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;45&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Lif and Lifthrasir&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  lie hidden&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  in the grove of Hoard-Mimir;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  the morning dews&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  they shall have as meat,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  from them generations will spring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Váfþruðnismál 45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The word &quot;lie hidden&quot; can also be interpreted as &quot;buried&quot; .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hence the entirety will be&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When the great fimbul-winter has passed, Lif and Lifthriasir will emerge from their hiding place and become the parents of a new race of men, without the need for a second act of creation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This type of metaphor is not unique in Germanic poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, since the holt &quot;hid&quot; or &quot;buried&quot; the two, they were able to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Poetic Edda, at several times, mentions Lif and Lifthrasir as the &lt;code&gt;only surviving seeds of humanity&lt;/code&gt;.

In terms of math, it seems to be involved in lots of combinations as shown:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The numbers 1,2 and 3 are all prime numbers and are symbolic of creation through the holy trinity. The number 12 would be reduced in numerology as 1+2=3, which means that the number 12 is also symbolic of the trinity. According to the rules of music vibration, we know that octaves of the fundamental vibration are created through multiplication or division from the number two. Two times twelve is 24 and half of 12 is 6. It is interesting to note that all prime numbers greater than 3 (the original trinity of prime numbers) are properties of the number six. The formula for creating prime numbers is 6n + 1where n is any number and + 1 is symbolic of unity or the original cause. For example: 6*2 = 12 and 12 – 1 is 11 and 12 + 1 is 13 and 11 and 13 are prime numbers. 6 *3 is 18 and 18 – 1 is 17 and 18 + 1 is 19 and both 17 and 19 are prime numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Religiously, it is known as the symbolic of the creation of the universe as it represents the division or fractionating of unity (God) into twelve individual distinct vibrations or tones.

The Noahide flood myth is detailed in Genesis chapters 6 through 9 of the Jewish/Christian Bible. The Ziusudra flood myth is from a single tablet often called Eridu Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Similarities&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Both floods are brought about by divine intervention.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Both floods were for the express purpose to destroy mankind.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Both persons build an ark to survive the flood.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Both persons save pairs of animals as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Differences&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ziusudra was a king; Genesis neither states nor implies that Noah is anything other than average.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ziusudra is part of a mythology that involves a pantheon of gods; Noah exists within the monotheistic Jewish mythology.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enlil, a god to Ziusudra, was annoyed by all the noise that human cities and activities made, so he persuaded the other gods to wipe out mankind. Noah's God was grieved that he had ever made mankind because every thought and action of their's was only wicked, so he decided to destroy them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enki, another god to Ziusudra, was fond of Ziusudra so he resolved to save him in some way. Noah's God seems to be conflicted, favoring Noah because he is actually not wicked, so God resolves to save Noah, his family, and the animals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ziusudra is rewarded by the gods with immortality. Within the myth itself, Noah is not rewarded with anything (some theologies certainly say he has eternal life, but that is not derived from the myth itself). In fact, Noah praises God and sacrifices and worships!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ziusudra's gods don't seem bothered that so many were killed. Noah's God promises that he will never again destroy mankind, showing perhaps regret for the whole affair.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ziusudra's flood myth doesn't seem to bother with rebuilding and re-population; there's no pragmatism, as is typical for myths. Noah's flood myth goes into this a great deal (i.e. there's genealogies, locations named, who settled where, etc.) and the stories in Genesis start to sound a little more plausible and less like epic legends.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dating of each myth suggests that the Sumerian Flood Epic (2300 BCE) may very well have influenced the development of the Jewish Flood Epic (1400 BCE to 700 BCE depending on who you ask). Many scholars believe that the whole Genesis creation myth (the first 11 chapters of Genesis) was influenced by the Babylonian version of the epic of Gilgamesh, which does mention a flood. Further, the Jewish people were held captive by the Babylonians in the 7th century BCE. This surely influenced their culture and already existing myths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jewish culture stands out among most other ancient cultures. Generally, they were xenophobic and extremely resistant to syncretism. They would fall away and worship other gods, but they were always defined by their &quot;one true God&quot;. You can see this in the Noahide adaptation of &quot;the flood that wiped out mankind&quot;. In Ziusudra's myth, the gods look at man like a plaything that entertains and aggravates them. The Jewish god loves his creation dearly and is grieved when they do wrong, not annoyed. Ziusudra's gods are one dimensional, having particular characteristics and persuasions, while the Jewish god is multifaceted and sometimes seems to contradict himself as a consequence of adapting these epics to revolve around a monotheism. In light of this, the differences between the two myths makes sense, while the core similarities remain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.piney.com/EriduGen.html&quot;&gt;The Eridu Genesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206-9&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;Genesis 6-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ancient.eu/eridu/&quot;&gt;Ancient History Encyclopedia - Eridu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity#Exilic_literature_and_post-exilic_revisions_of_the_Torah.2FPentateuch&quot;&gt;Wikipedia - Babylonian Captivity - Exilic literature and post-exilic revisions of the Torah/Pentateuch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="93" LastEditorUserId="93" LastEditDate="2015-05-01T17:55:17.670" LastActivityDate="2015-05-01T17:55:17.670" CommentCount="0" />

The earliest such mounds may have been a small hill of earth or sand, but the icon eventually took the form of a small pyramid carved from a single block of stone, known as a bnbn (benben). This name comes from the root, bn, which means to &quot;sell up&quot; or &quot;swell forth&quot;. The benben also, because of the sun's part in creation, came to be an icon of both the primeval mound as well as the sun which rose from it. In fact, the Egyptian word for the rising sun is wbn, which comes from the same root as benben.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above extract tells how the &quot;rising mound of earth&quot; was imitated by the pyramids and how the Egyptians considered it sacred. That sacred feeling was achieved by the Egyptians through the construction of the pyramids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Multiple sources do confirm that the Egyptian pyramids were based on their beliefs on benben:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;First of all, they reflect the shape of the primordial mound of creation &quot;benben&quot;.

The central motif involves two twins born of the sky deity (or sun), with some customary attributes such as being horsemen or riding horse-drawn chariots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Another manifestation of the binary conception of society and the world is the cult of twins widespread in Indo-European mythology. A myth of divine twins who are children of the sun god goes back to Proto-Indo-European antiquity. The myth is found in all the main ancient Indo-European traditions, which not only repeat the same motfisbut also share correspondences in the names of the heroes, thus establishing the Proto-Indo-European character of the motif and the personages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt; - Gamkrelidze, T.

The ballgame was called tlaxtli or tlachtli. The court consisted of two walls with some twenty or thirty feet of distance between them and each was up to forty or fifty feet in length. The floor and walls were heavily plastered, the latter having some one and a half estados [nearly ten feet] in height. In the middle of the court was a line made especially for the game; and in the middle of the walls, halfway down the playing stretch, were two stones like millstones perforated in the middle, facing each other, and they each had holes wide enough that the ball could fit into each of them. And whoever placed the ball there won the game. They did not play with their hands but hit the ball with their flanks. For playing they wore gloves on their hands and a leather apron on their flanks to hit the ball (Sahagún 1938, II.viii.10, pp. 297-298).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mesoweb.com/publications/christenson/popolvuh.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the online version of Allen J.

It tells the story of how the gods created the worlds, the animals, and of the god's several attempts to create humans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important thing to note is that the reason behind the failure of the gods several attempts to create humans is that their attempts could not speak the names of the gods (e.g. know of them or worship them). Here's an example of this (this passage accounts why just creating animals was insufficient):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Speak therefore our names. Worship  us, for we are your Mother and your Father. Say this, therefore: ‘Huracan, Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt, Heart of Sky and Heart of Earth, Framer and Shaper, She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons.’ Speak! Call upon us! Worship us!” they were told.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But they did not succeed. They did not speak like people. They only squawked and chattered and roared. Their speech was unrecognizable, for each cried out in a&#xA;  different way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When they heard this, the Framer and the Shaper said, “Their speech did not&#xA;  turn out well.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And again they said to each other:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“They were not able to speak our names. We are their Framer and their Shaper.&#xA;  This is not good,” said She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons to&#xA;  each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mesoweb.com/publications/christenson/popolvuh.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the online version of Allen J. Christenson's translation&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Xibalba (the underworld) doesn't appear until after three failed creation attempts (the second and third attempts failed for the same reason as the first creation attempt). They first appear to oppose the fathers of the twins, &quot;One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu,&quot; who, it is important to note, were &quot;born to Xpiyacoc and Xmucane&quot; (two of the seven gods who created the world) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mesoweb.com/publications/christenson/popolvuh.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Christenson&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“What is happening on the surface of the earth? They are just stomping about and&#xA;  shouting. May they be summoned here therefore. They shall come to play ball, and we&#xA;  shall defeat them. They have simply failed to honor us. They have neither honor nor&#xA;  respect. Certainly they act arrogantly here over our heads,” said therefore all&#xA;  those of Xibalba.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mesoweb.com/publications/christenson/popolvuh.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Christenson&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should become clear that the lords of Xibalba are an opposing force to the creation god(desses). Not only are they the lords of death, but they, like the lords of creation, also want recognition from humans. As explained in the online book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/popolvuh/pv-hp.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esotericism of the Popol Vuh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (which uses a different translation of the Popol Vuh):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We have here a contest between opposing forces, since those of Xibalbá cannot tolerate that &quot; 'anyone greater than they, or any having greater power, should exist,' they all said unanimously.&quot; From this passage it is seen that the organization of the false gods is similar to that of the true since, like the latter, the false gods compose a sevenfold entity whose components must get together and reach decisions by a unanimity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, when the Lords of Xibalba are defeated, their power is restricted, paving the way for the creation gods and goddesses to create humans: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Very well. Here then is our word that we declare to you. Hearken all&#xA;  you of Xibalba; for never again will you or your posterity be great.&#xA;  Your offerings also will never again be great. They will henceforth be&#xA;  reduced to croton sap. No longer will clean blood be yours. Unto you&#xA;  will be given only worn-out griddles and pots, only flimsy and brittle&#xA;  things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Thus began their devastation, the ruin of their being called upon in&#xA;  worship. Their glory was not great in the past, for they wanted only&#xA;  conflict with the people of ancient times. &lt;strong&gt;Surely they were not true&#xA;  gods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the plot perspective, the game &quot;ball&quot; is simply a competition to resolve the conflict, and the story wouldn't be much different if they played chess or another game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Just to clarify the plot: One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu are defeated by Xibalba, but their sons learn to play ball, go to Xibalba, and defeat the Lords of Xibalba. Afterwords, humans are finally created.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;The Symbolic Interpretation of the Game&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, another way of looking at the game is as a symbol representing the sky. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/popolvuh/pv-hp.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esotericism of the Popol Vuh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Besides symbolizing the sun's relative position in the order of its rising and its daily trajectory, Hunahpú and Ixbalamqué, playing alone for a long time on opposite sides of the court, represent the position of the sun and the moon at opposing solstices, just as this continues to be depicted on Chortí altars. All this unmistakably reflects a gradual progress in astronomic and cosmogonic knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Popol Vuh is the only American source to speak of the origin of the ball game and place it in time. Not only does it tell us of the game's ethnological antiquity, it also explains its symbolism. It in fact establishes a parallel between the ball players and the solar gods, which from the angles of the universe — to employ the phraseology of the Chumayel manuscript — meet in the center, in this case in the ball court, where they can convert themselves into two and even four persons with no loss of their theogonic individuality, at once a unity and a multiplicity. During the ball game they wear their resplendent ceremonial gear — that is, they exhibit their insignia as solar deities. Two by two they come from the eastern and western sectors of the cosmos and, meeting in the center, forge themselves into the individuality of Heart of Heaven. This fusion of a number of forms under &quot;one single head,&quot; as the Chortís say, is expressed in the principal rule of the game which is that the players can touch the ball only with their body but never with their heads, feet, or arms; each time this happens a point is given the other team. The continual contact of two or four bodies with a single ball makes clear the monotheistic principle whereby the deity integrates itself through the union of its hypostases. This idea is objectified in the group of ball players unable to use their heads or extremities since the ball — the symbol of the Star or Sun god — is alternatively the head of each. This figure of a single-headed god having many bodies is characteristic of Maya thought. We need only to remember Oxlahun-oc (&quot;it of the thirteen feet&quot;), who is mentioned in the Chilam Balam of Chumayel. The motion of the ball imitates the trajectory of the sun, a figure that the Chortí actors also reproduce in their dramatization of this part of the Popol Vuh. Besides this, the Quiché codex represents the descent of god-Seven from the Center of Heaven to the center of the earth by the solar bird which, coming down from on high, &quot;came to see them play.&quot; As said, in Chortí religious allegory the bird of prey, which is the mask, nahual, or messenger of the deity of Heaven, descends vertically to the center of the earth — like the sun's rays — when the daystar goes through the zenith, symbolizing the descent of divine grace. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This interpretation lends a new interpretation to the text: Xibalba, the &quot;Lords of the subterrene regions&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/popolvuh/pv-hp.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esotericism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are in conflict with the lords of the sky (the creators of the world) over power over the living world. The punishment of the Lords of Xibalba (&quot;you... shall no longer be allowed to play ball.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) reflects that Xibalba is restricted to a subteranian sphere, and that the power of death is limited. This may be one of the reasons why the gods can then create humans who &quot;can speak their name.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, we don't know enough to know without a doubt the real symbolism behind the ball game&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The conquistadors deliberately supressed indiginous culture when they conquored central america, and only four written mayan documents remain. It's impossible to understate the destruction that these cultures faced, and we are very fortunate that texts like the Popol Vuh still exist.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I am continuously amazed at the quality of sources on mythology available online. Why would anyone want to read wikipedia?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This line does not occur in the Christenson translation, but the Lords of Xibalba still faced severe restrictions on their power.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; There is disagreement about the meaning of the ball game.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A good account of the translation can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/20736600&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on JStor (behind a paywall)&lt;/a&gt;.

As &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamtime&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; says, the word was a (mis)translation of an Aboriginal word, &lt;em&gt;alcheringa&lt;/em&gt;, also transliterated as &lt;em&gt;altjira&lt;/em&gt;. The Dreamtime, however, is not just a past event. It existed thousands of years ago, exists in the present, and will exist far into the future. It is an entity that forms the basis for Aboriginal spirituality, rituals, and history. Another word, &lt;em&gt;tjurjunga&lt;/em&gt;, is perhaps a better description of this facet of the concept. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aboriginalartonline.com/culture/dreamtim.php&quot;&gt;Aboriginal Art Online&lt;/a&gt;) However, different tribes have different languages, and so the usage varies across Australia; &lt;em&gt;alcheringa&lt;/em&gt; is simply one of the most commonly used terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many different Dreamtime stories, arising from the fact that the Aboriginal people are not one group, but a collection of related cultures that happen to live on the same continent. This also means that there are many different versions of the same story. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gadimirrabooka.com/dreamtime&quot;&gt;Gadi Mirrabooka Aboriginal Stories&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One big problem is that all these stories are completely separate. The Aboriginal people do not have a single &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; &quot;holy book&quot;, as some religions do, nor do they have a certain set of deities. Rather, they believe that certain spirits - often nameless - or ancestors were responsible for the creation of certain things in their world. These ancestors can take very different forms - not necessarily human - depending on which people are telling the story. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.australianhistory.org/dreamtime&quot;&gt;Australian History - Dreamtime&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some specific stories about how certain creatures arose, or how certain features formed. Attempts have been made to correlate these with actual archaeological dates. Unfortunately, there isn't necessarily a connection between when the Aboriginal legends arose and when the things they talk about arose. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aboriginalstories.org.au/aboriginal-storytelling&quot;&gt;Aboriginal Stories&lt;/a&gt;) One claim says that some stories go back 65,000 years, making it possible that the stories correctly told of when the creatures were created, if not the actual accurate process.

The exact details of the myth(s) of this period have never been shared with non-Aboriginals, so almost nothing is known about them. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a few separate answers. Some groups believe that the Dreamtime is/was eternal. This belief goes hand in hand with the idea that the Dreamtime is still occurring. The Gunwinggu follow this belief. Another belief is that the creation happened &quot;a long time ago&quot;, or in &quot;the distant past&quot;.

They sent him on ahead to obtain for&#xA;  them what he could hear:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Next he bit the third one seated there, who was One Death—“Ouch!” said&#xA;  each one when he was bitten. “What?” was their reply:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Ow!” said One Death.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“What, One Death? What is it?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“I am being bitten!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s just . . . Ow! What was that? Now I am being bitten!” said the&#xA;  fourth one seated there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“What, Seven Death? What is it?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“I am being bitten!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[this goes on for some time]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Thus their names were named. Each of them revealed the name of the&#xA;  other. Each of the individuals in order of their rank had his name&#xA;  revealed by the one who sat next to him, Not one of their names was&#xA;  missed until all of the names were named when they were bitten by a&#xA;  hair that Hunahpu had plucked from the front of his knee. It wasn’t&#xA;  really a mosquito that had bitten them. And so Hunahpu and Xbalanque&#xA;  heard the names of all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This allows the twins to name all of the Lords of Xibalba, and thus have power over them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;All of them had their faces revealed, for all of their names were&#xA;  named. Not one of their names was missed. When they were called upon,&#xA;  they gave the names of each one without leaving any of them out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrast this to how the parents of the twins were tricked by the Lords of Xibalba because they didn't know their names:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Thus they [One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu, the parents of the twins Hunahpú and Ixbalamqué] did not prevail [because they didn't know who the Lords of Xibalba were, and confused them with wooden statues]. Instead, the lords of Xibalba roared &#xA;  with laughter. They merely roared with laughter, all the lords,&#xA;  because they had completely prevailed. In their hearts, they had&#xA;  defeated One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(the above quotations are all from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mesoweb.com/publications/christenson/popolvuh.pdf&quot;&gt;the online version of Allen J.

That&#xA;  method, invented by Hunahpú, a sage par excellence, explains the&#xA;  origin of an interesting magical practice employed by one class of&#xA;  Chortí wise men, who &quot;foretell by means of the calf of the leg,&quot;&#xA;  imitating the pattern laid down by the god-hero who found out the&#xA;  names of his adversaries by means of a hair torn from his shin. An&#xA;  identical procedure, consisting of throwing out magical darts, is also&#xA;  used by Chortí elders who declare they &quot;have shot the god-Seven&quot; when&#xA;  by magical art they succeed in making the Agrarian deity descend to&#xA;  the center of the earth. A similar method is also mentioned in Mexican&#xA;  sources which say that the sun, having come to a halt, was stung by a&#xA;  mosquito in its leg. Ixtlilxóchitl says of this that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;during the Third Age [equivalent to the Age in which the Popol Vuh places the invention of shooting out such magical darts], the sun&#xA;    stood still for one full day without moving from its place; and as the&#xA;    mosquito saw the sun so still and pensive, it said, &quot;Lord of the&#xA;    World, why are you so still and thoughtful and why don't you carry out&#xA;    your duty as you are ordered? Do you want to destroy the world, as you&#xA;    are now doing?&quot; And seeing that the sun was silent and did not answer,&#xA;    the mosquito approached and bit it on the leg. Feeling itself bitten,&#xA;    the sun began to travel its usual course again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In another version it is Citli who shoots an arrow at the sun but, the&#xA;  arrow having missed its mark, the sun kills Citli.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/popolvuh/pv-hp.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esotericism of the Popol Vuh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2015-05-02T22:03:34.060" CommentCount="0" />

She may have been Queen of Ithaca, but she had little actual power. All men loyal to Odysseus had followed him to Troy, she simply had no way of forcing the suitors to leave the palace. And of course she feared that antagonizing the suitors in any way would put Telemachus' life in danger. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Telemachus did try to order the suitors out of the palace, in front of the Ithacan assembly: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he was bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then, turning to Aegyptius, &quot;Sir,&quot; said he, &quot;it is I, as you will shortly learn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you, nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes which have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and was like a father to every one of you; the second is much more serious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will. They are afraid to go to her father Icarius, asking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my father's house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is the beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends, and leave me singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father Ulysses did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of house and home at all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till I got paid in full, whereas now I have no remedy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;With this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who spoke thus: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault not ours, for she is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait- for I would not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.html&quot;&gt;The Odyssey, Book II, translated by Samuel Butler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Telemachus insolence was not only ignored, but it also instigated a plot amongst the suitors to kill him as he returned from his visits to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestor_(mythology)&quot;&gt;Nestor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelaus&quot;&gt;Menelaus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="57" LastEditorUserId="57" LastEditDate="2015-05-02T23:21:25.237" LastActivityDate="2015-05-02T23:21:25.237" CommentCount="0" />

For instance, the Christian church grew from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+1%3A15&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;~120&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2%3A41&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;3000+&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations#Adherent_estimates&quot;&gt;2.2 billion&lt;/a&gt; through the efforts of human evangelism.

The devil, also known as Satan or Lucifer, used to be the best and brightest (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+14:12&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt;) of the angels. He and the demons especially attack Jews/Christians (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+5%3A8&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;1 Peter 5:3&lt;/a&gt;), and Michael and the angels fight back (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+10:12-14&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;Daniel 10:12-14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A rather popular misconception among Christians is that God and Satan are equals. This is entirely wrong. &lt;em&gt;Michael&lt;/em&gt; and Satan/Lucifer are equals, even brothers. Furthermore, one good way to look at God is as if He was an Author and that this whole universe and all the events that happen are part of one huge, grand Story. In that sense, this struggle between angels and demons is the classic Good vs. Evil battle. If God were to step in and wipe out all the forces of Evil with a single thought, that would be Deus Ex Machina of the highest order, and make for a pretty poor Story. Really, God has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; won the War with the death and resurrection of His Son Jesus Christ (and the demons never had a chance), but the battles continue for the souls of people, and will continue until God brings the Story to its conclusion (the first chapter anyway).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To directly answer your questions, God &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; command His side in the war, but as Commander-in-Chief and does not get directly, personally involved in the battles.

In some versions of the myth, Midas's hard-won insight into the meaning of life and the limitations of earthly wealth is accompanied by conversion to the cult of Dionysus. Having learned his lessons as an initiate into the mysteries, and after ritual immersion in the river Pactolus, Midas forsakes the “bogus eternity” of gold for spiritual rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia also says,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In Latin, Charon's obol sometimes is called a viaticum, or &quot;sustenance for the journey&quot;; the placement of the coin on the mouth has been explained also as a seal to protect the deceased's soul or to prevent it from returning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basis for these interpretations are analyses of Latin writers; the theories stem from, among others, &quot;Charon's Obol&quot; by Susan T.

It was a water&#xA;  world inhabited only by animals and creatures of the air who could&#xA;  survive without land.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Up above, the Sky World was quite different. Human-type beings lived&#xA;  there with infinite types of plants and animals to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the Sky World, there was a Tree of Life that was very special to&#xA;  the people of the Sky World. They knew that it grew at the entrance to&#xA;  the world below and forbade anyone to tamper with the Tree. One woman&#xA;  who was soon to give birth was curious about the Tree and convinced&#xA;  her brother to uproot the Tree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Beneath the Tree was a great hole. The woman peered from the edge into&#xA;  the hole and suddenly fell off the edge. As she was falling she&#xA;  grasped at the edge and clutched in her hand some of the earth from&#xA;  the Sky World. As she fell, the birds of the world below were&#xA;  disturbed and alerted to her distress. The birds responded and&#xA;  gathered a great many of their kind to break her fall and cradle her&#xA;  to the back of a great sea turtle. The creatures of the water believed&#xA;  that she needed land to live on, so they set about to collect some for&#xA;  her. They dove to the great depths of the world's oceans to gather&#xA;  earth to make her a place to live. Many of the animals tried to gather&#xA;  the earth from the ocean floor, only the muskrat was successful. With&#xA;  only a small bit of earth brought onto turtle's back from his small&#xA;  paws, Turtle Island began to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Sky Woman soon gave birth to a daughter on Turtle Island. The&#xA;  daughter grew fast. There were no man-beings on Turtle Island, but a&#xA;  being known as the West Wind married the daughter of Sky Woman.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Soon the daughter of Sky Woman gave birth to Twins. One was born the&#xA;  natural way, and he was called the Right-Handed Twin. The other was&#xA;  born in a way that caused the death of the mother. He was called the&#xA;  Left-Handed Twin. When their mother died, their grandmother, Sky&#xA;  Woman, placed the fistful of earth that she grasped from the edge of&#xA;  the Sky World, and placed it on her daughter's grave. The earth&#xA;  carried special seeds from the Sky World that were nourished by the&#xA;  earth over her daughter. So from the body of her daughter came the&#xA;  Sacred Tobacco, Strawberry and Sweetgrass. We call these Kionhekwa.&#xA;  The Life Givers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Right and Left-Handed Twins were endowed with special creative&#xA;  powers. The Right-Handed Twin created gentle hills, beautiful smelling&#xA;  flowers, quiet brooks, butterflies and numerous creatures, plants and&#xA;  earth formations. His brother the Left-Handed Twin made snakes, thorns&#xA;  on rose bushes, thunder and lightning and other more disturbing&#xA;  attributes of today's world. Together, they created man and his many&#xA;  attributes. The Right-Handed Twin believed in diplomacy and conflict&#xA;  resolution. The Left-Handed Twin believed in conflict as resolution.&#xA;  They were very different, but all that they created is an integral&#xA;  part of this Earth's Creation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Their Grandmother, Sky Woman, now came to the end of her life. When&#xA;  she died, the Twins fought over her body and pulled it apart, throwing&#xA;  her head into the sky. As part of the Sky World, there her head&#xA;  remained to shine upon the world as Grandmother Moon. The Twins could&#xA;  not live together without fighting. They agreed to dwell in different&#xA;  realms of the earth. The Right-Handed Twin continued to live in the&#xA;  daylight and the Left-Handed Twin became a dweller of the night. Both&#xA;  of them continue their special duties to their Mother the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this doesn't tell us where the Sky People came from.

[...] It would be both grievous and tedious to relate the&#xA;  slaughter, the cruel havoc, and the excess of fury that was to be seen&#xA;  on both sides. In this manner they spent a good part of the day, till&#xA;  Arthur at last made a push with his company, consisting of six&#xA;  thousand six hundred and sixty-six men, against that in which he knew&#xA;  Modred was; and having opened a way with their swords, they pierced&#xA;  quite through it, and made a grievous slaughter. For in this assault&#xA;  fell the wicked traitor himself, and many thousands with him. [...]&#xA;  And even the renowned king Arthur himself was mortally wounded; and&#xA;  being carried thence to the isle of Avallon to be cured of his wounds,&#xA;  he gave up the crown of Britain to his kinsman Constantine, the son of&#xA;  Cador, duke of Cornwall, in the five hundred and forty-second year of&#xA;  our Lord's incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. 1155:&lt;/strong&gt; Wace's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/wace_mason.pdf&quot;&gt;Roman de Brut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (translation by Eugene Mason) says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Arthur was sick with wrath that he was not avenged of Mordred. He had&#xA;  neither peace nor rest whilst the traitor abode in his land. Arthur&#xA;  learned of Mordred’s strength in Cornwall, and this was grievous to&#xA;  him. [...] Arthur sent after his men to the very Humber. He gathered&#xA;  to himself so mighty a host that it was as the sand for multitude.&#xA;  With this he sought Mordred where he knew he could be found. He&#xA;  purposed to slay and make an end of the traitor and his perjury alike.&#xA;  Mordred had no desire to shrink from battle. He preferred to stake all&#xA;  on the cast, yea, though the throw meant death—rather than be harried&#xA;  from place to place. The battle was arrayed on the Camel, over against&#xA;  the entrance to Cornwall. [...] There, too, was Mordred slain in the&#xA;  press, together with the greater part of his folk; and in the selfsame&#xA;  day were destroyed the flower of Arthur’s host, the best and hardiest&#xA;  of his men. So the chronicle speaks sooth, Arthur himself was wounded&#xA;  in his body to the death. He caused him to be borne to Avalon for the&#xA;  searching of his hurts. [...] Arthur bade that he should be carried to&#xA;  Avalon in this hope in the year 642 of the Incarnation. The sorer&#xA;  sorrow that he was a childless man. To Constantine, Cador’s son, Earl&#xA;  of Cornwall, and his near kin, Arthur committed the realm, commanding&#xA;  him to hold it as king until he returned to his own. The earl took the&#xA;  land to his keeping.

And when Sir Mordred felt that he had his death’s wound, he&#xA;  thrust himself with the might that he had up to the bur* of King&#xA;  Arthur’s spear; and right so he smote his father, King Arthur, with&#xA;  his sword holding in both his hands, upon the side of the head, that&#xA;  the sword pierced the helmet and the tay* of the brain. And there-with&#xA;  Mordred dashed down stark dead to the earth. And noble King Arthur&#xA;  fell in a swoon to the earth, and there he swooned oftentimes.[...]&#xA;  ‘Comfort thyself,’ said the King, ‘and do as well as thou mayest, for&#xA;  in me is no trust for to trust in. For I will into the vale of Avilion&#xA;  to heal me of my grievous wound; and if thou hear never more of me,&#xA;  pray for my soul.’&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wider context in &lt;em&gt;Le Morte d'Arthur&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Sir Gawain has been slain in a recent battle with Mordred's forces. Later, he comes to Arthur in a dream and warns him not to battle with Mordred. Arthur asks for a truce, and the two armies meet to discuss this, but after a snake appears, a knight draws a sword to kill it. This is taken as a symbol of aggression, and the &quot;final battle&quot; starts. After Arthur is mortally wounded, he gives his sword, Excalibur, to Sir Bedivere to throw in a lake. After Sir Bedivere finally complies, a hand rises from the water to catch the sword.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditDate="2015-05-03T22:52:38.520" LastActivityDate="2015-05-03T22:52:38.520" CommentCount="1" />

Looking at the offspring of Phorcys and Ceto, some few of them appear to have been killed.  In one version of the story, Ladon was killed by Heracles, in pursuit of the Apples of the Hesperides (his 11th labor).  Echidna was killed by Argus Panoptes, as related in pseudo-Apollodorus Library.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea that, by some chance of fate, she was born mortal seems more in line with my impression from the phrasing used in translations of Hesiod, with phrases like &quot;suffered a woeful fate&quot; or &quot;suffered grievously&quot;, in the two translation I've seen.

The house of the Polar Star stands in the zenith. Directly under it is a hole through which it is possible to pass from one world to another. Through a series of these holes the Polar Star can be seen in al the lower and higher worlds, while the other constellations change with the diferent worlds. Carrying this idea further, the house of the Polar Star is supposed to be higher than that of any other star. It is made of a material similar to ice, and on the top of it is set the beacon - lamp of the star.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Chukchi being a people living in the arctic Siberia, one would indeed expect the North Star to be central to their cosmogony.

They are stones of a vast magnitude and wonderful quality; and if they can be placed here, as they are there, round this spot of ground, they will stand forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was an idea which gained popularity alongside much of Monmouth's writings. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Aurelius ordered Merlin to erect round the burial-place the stones which he had brought from Ireland.

From Khaos (Air) came forth Erebos (Darkness) and black Nyx (Night); but of Nyx (Night) were born Aither (Light) and Hemera (Day), whom she conceived and bore from union in love with Erebos. And Gaia (Earth) first bore starry Ouranos (Heaven), equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she brought forth long Ourea (Mountains), graceful haunts of the goddess Nymphai who dwell amongst the glens of the hills. She bore also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontos (Sea), without sweet union of love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But afterwards he [Gaia, Earth] lay with Ouranos (Heaven) and bare deep-swirling Okeanos, Koios and Krios and Hyperion and Iapetos, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoibe and lovely Tethys.

Ge (Earth), Aer (Air) and Ouranos (Heaven) had no existence. Firstly, black-winged Nyx (Night) laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebos (Darkness), and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros (Love) with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartaros (Hell-Pit) with dark Khaos (Air), winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race [the birds], which was the first to see the light. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their marriage Ouranos (Heaven), Okeanos (Ocean), Ge (Earth) and the imperishable race of blessed gods (Theoi) sprang into being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;-- Aristophanes, Birds 685&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, Gaea is understood to be a personification of the Earth; the same goes for Chaos, Erebus/Erebos, Eros, and many of the others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For information on just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Gaea begat her children, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/650/how-were-the-first-children-of-gaia-conceived&quot;&gt;How were the first children of Gaia conceived?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="183" LastEditorUserId="183" LastEditDate="2015-05-13T20:51:51.370" LastActivityDate="2015-05-13T20:51:51.370" CommentCount="0" />

Egyptian creation accounts do not seem to have envisaged the possibility of something being created from nothing. Instead, they describe how everything in the world-all its elements and forces-came from a single source, much like the primordial singularity in the &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory of modern physics. This original source of all things was known as the god Atum. The god's name means &quot;finisher,&quot; and refers to the fact that Atum &quot;finished up&quot; as the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;snip&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The birth of the sun is actually the cumlination of creation in the Heliopolitan system, as it is in the early myth of the primeval mound. The sun's first rising into the newly created world-space marks the end of creation and the beginning of the eternal cycle of life, which the sun regulates (as king of nature) and makes possible through his heat and light. The Heliopolitan accounts therefore concentrate not only on Atum's &quot;evolution&quot; but also on the sun's role in the creation. An element of nature, the sun is known simply as &quot;Sun&quot; (usually trascribed &quot;Re&quot; or &quot;Ra&quot;). As the newly risen &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Egypt&quot;&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=6KUdBAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;q=creation#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=ptah&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;yet another interpretation&lt;/a&gt; which is very similar to that of Heliopolis, except that &lt;strong&gt;Ptah&lt;/strong&gt; served as the intermediary through which Atum's will was given form:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But much older is Ptah, who enlivened all the gods as well as their life-forces through this heart and through this tongue ... His Ennead is in his presence in teeth and lips, which are the seed and hands of Atum: for Atum's Ennead evolved form his seed and his fingers, but the Ennead is teeth and lips in this mouth that pronounced the identity of everything and through which Shu and Tefnut emerged and gave bearth to the Ennead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebes,_Egypt&quot;&gt;Thebes&lt;/a&gt; is the city that believed in Amun &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=0H3v0nPk1V4C&amp;amp;q=thebes#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=thebes&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;taking the form of an animal, e.g. a goose or a serpent&lt;/a&gt;.

However, it is suggested elsewhere that he emitted a mighty honk, like a goose, which burst into the stillness of the universe, causing a cosmic reaction by which the Ogdoad and the Ennead were formed.&#xA;  The Thebans developed a distinct theology in which Amun was concealed even from the gods, existing somewhere beyond the natural world. It was thought that a creator had to stand apart from his creation, and Amun, the &quot;hidden&quot; god, suited this role. The texts summarized Amun's mystery and power:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&quot;He is hidden from the gods, and his aspect is unknown. He is farther than the sky, he is deeper than the Duat. No god knows his true appearance ... no one testifies to him accurately. He is too secret to uncover his awesomeness, he is too great to investigate, too powerful to know.

This repetition of 13s has led some to suppose that a similar re-set of the bak’tun system is upon us now, and that we are destined to go back to 1.0.0.0.0 in some 400 years from now. This is not true. Based on texts from Palenque that project calendar stations far into the future, we know there will be a linear sequence of bak’tuns from here on, represented as 14.0.0.0.0, 15.0.0.0.0, and so on. This will run forward still until 19.0.0.0.0, about 2,400 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Notice that at the end of this roughly 13,000-year span that the bak’tun changes to 0 and the next higher period, the piktun, turns over as 1. As it happens, the piktun unit before this date was set at 13, although this is left unwritten in the dates above.

In fact, it may well be that the very high incidence of neuroticism among ourselves follows from the decline among us of such effective spiritual aid. **We remain fixated to the unexercised images of our infancy, and hence disinclined to the necessary passages of our adulthood. ** ... The psychoanalyst has to come along, at last, to assert again the tried wisdom of the older, forward looking teachings of the masked medicine dances and the witch-doctor-circumcisers; whereupon we find, as in the dream of the serpent bite, that ageless initiation symbolism is produced spontaneously by the patient himself at the moment of the release. Apparently, there is something in these initiatory images so necessary to the psyche that if they are not supplied from without, through myth and ritual, they will have to be announced again, through dream, from within-lest our energies remain locked in a banal, long-outmoded toy-room, at the bottom of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as a citation for Campbell saying that classic myths from many cultures follow this pattern, he said, again in The Hero with a Thousand Faces:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The wonder is that characteristic efficacy to touch and inspire deep creative centers dwells in the smallest nursery fair tale-as the flavor of the ocean is contained in a droplet or the whole mystery of life within the egg of a flea. For the symbols of mythology are not manufactured; they cannot be ordered, inveted, or permanently suppressed. They are spontaneous productions of the psyche, and each bears within it, undamaged, the germ power of its source.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the secret of the timeless vision?

I'm writing this answer because there are several misconceptions floating around about the meaning and the implications of Campbell's monomyth, and I want to clarify them. This answer also gets at the original question -- why is the monomyth so common.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I'm not going to cite sources in this answer because this is my own interpretation of Campbell, and the arguments I'm using are probably different from Campbell's own. However, I think my interpretation is useful and will help people understand Campbell.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The monomyth is more interesting to people who study literature than it is to people who study religion. This is because it is fundamentally about how stories are composed and not directly about religion, though Campbell (successfully) argues that stories are a key component of religion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although most people describe the monomyth as having 12 steps, I think of it as a two step process:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The hero is put into an unfamiliar situation or faces an obstacle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The hero learns to overcome that situation/obstacle (or just learns something) &#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The hero could be compared to a child/adolescent learning to navigate the world.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason why the monomyth is so common is that the two step formula I just described is one of the best ways to tell a story; some people would say it's the only way. &lt;em&gt;If you are an author and you want to teach your readers a lesson (e.g. how to live their life), a great way to do that is to create a story where the hero faces a challenge (e.g. my life is not meaningful) and then overcomes it (e.g. the hero finds meaning in their life). &lt;strong&gt;Because people place themselves in the situation and see through the eyes of the characters they read about&lt;/strong&gt;, the reader will then learn from the fictional characters and learn how to overcome similar obstacles in their own life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Campbell notes, the monomyth is frequently used in religion, but I think that has more to do with the fact that religions use stories than with religions using the monomyth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastEditorUserId="11" LastEditDate="2015-05-06T21:58:54.543" LastActivityDate="2015-05-06T21:58:54.543" CommentCount="0" />

The most important part of this story is that the hero and the &quot;otherworld&quot; character swap places. From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mabinogi.net/pwyll.htm#_ftn9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;footnotes of your online translation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As this point the plot begins to take the form of another stereotyped&#xA;  narrative mytheme, equally familiar throughout the Celtic world. The&#xA;  Otherworld Sojourn, as we might call this scenario, could take a&#xA;  number of forms: but always followed the same basic gist: the mortal&#xA;  protagonist is lured to an Otherworldly domain, where they&#xA;  subsequently abide for a period of time. This occurs at the&#xA;  instigation of one or more of the Otherworld beings, and often follows&#xA;  a Chase of the White Stag introduction, or some variant thereof.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The purpose of Pwyll's sorjourn in the Indigenous Underworld is to rid&#xA;  Arawn of his 'oppression': the rival king Hafgan ('Summer-Bright')&#xA;  with whom he is locked in a ongoing and irreconcilable conflict. A&#xA;  further example of mortal interventions in Otherworldly conflicts of&#xA;  this kind in the Celtic world include Arthur's adjudication of the&#xA;  seasonal dual between Gwynn ap Nudd and Gwerthyfyr ap Greidawl for the&#xA;  hand of Creiyldyd, on the Calends of May. In this and other respects,&#xA;  the plot of The Sickness of CuChulain and The Only Jealosy of Emer&#xA;  follows this First Branch episode even closer: complete with the&#xA;  'Chase of the White Stag' entrée. This narrative can be summarised&#xA;  thus:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[it compares the story with another story]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Like Pwyll, CúChulainn finds himself indebted to Otherworld powers as&#xA;  a result of abusing magical animals on a hunting expedition. Like&#xA;  Pwyll also, this encounter carries the appearance of having been&#xA;  contrived and instigated by the Otherworld agency. The measured&#xA;  responses of Arawn ('I know who you are...'), the location and timing&#xA;  of their encounter, and its favourable outcome for the Annuvian king&#xA;  suggest that the event was no coincidence. Like Cú Chulainn, Pwyll was&#xA;  in effect drawn and entrapped by the otherworld powers involved. And&#xA;  both were required to visit Underworld regions where they were obliged&#xA;  to lend their assistance as mortal warriors in the magical&#xA;  protagonists' struggles for power. Interestingly as well, the Irish&#xA;  Manawydan - Manannan mac Lír - features in this same story as the one&#xA;  time spouse of the heroine involved. (As we shall see in subsequent&#xA;  chapters, Pwyll and Manawydan become linked in a similar way).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the most relevant section:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;That the denizens of the Indigenous Underworld should be so in need of&#xA;  the military prowess of mortal warriors is another motif not&#xA;  unfamiliar within the Celtic world and beyond. The well known myth of&#xA;  the aversion of faery-folk to iron is an example of the ambiguous&#xA;  power-relationship between themselves and the mortal world. The&#xA;  Indigenous Underworld, however, while being mysteriously vulnerable in&#xA;  certain respects, was clearly a source of danger when it came to&#xA;  magical initiatives. The trade-off of these respective strengths and&#xA;  weaknesses is a frequent theme in fairy tales and popular magical&#xA;  tales from around the world. It was within this tradition that the&#xA;  narrative of much of the Mabinogi would have been understood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The narratives produced by animistic belief systems often focus on the&#xA;  acquisition of power, in its elemental-magical form. The struggle for&#xA;  possession of this substance of power is typically waged by any&#xA;  variety of means: trickery and cunning prevailing as frequently as any&#xA;  other stratagem. In this episode Pwyll is consummately manipulated by&#xA;  the Underworld agent who thereby obtains his power, which becomes&#xA;  harnessed to the latter's own agenda in the arena of Annuvian&#xA;  politics.&lt;/em&gt; Through an act of impulsive foolishness (significantly, as&#xA;  we shall see, involving the dog and the stag), the ironically-named&#xA;  Pwyll (see p ##-##) had inadvertedly placed himself in a chain of&#xA;  events, which would ultimately result in a mysterious fusion between&#xA;  Dyfed and Annwn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This story is about the somewhat coercive relationship between the &quot;otherworld&quot; and the real world. &lt;em&gt;I think it's just as important to the story that Arawn (the otherworlder) takes Pwyll's (the human's) place in the real world:&lt;/em&gt; both the otherworld and the real world have their strengths and weaknesses, and this story is about travelling between the two, and about man's relationship with spirits. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of god's and spirits isn't to do everything themselves, but (in this story) to coerce and trick mortals into doing things for them. A specific logical reason why Arawn needs Pwyll doesn't exist, because the point of this story is that it's an example of the interactions between the spirit and real world, and not that &quot;Arawn needed Pwyll because Pwyll is really stealthy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastEditorUserId="62" LastEditDate="2015-05-06T22:47:54.280" LastActivityDate="2015-05-06T22:47:54.280" CommentCount="0" />

While the story Culhwch and Olwen has humorous overtones, that shouldn't detract from the &quot;sacredness&quot; of it.

Modern audiences have become accustomed to the&#xA;  specialised use of parodic humour as a device to undermine, deflate or&#xA;  dismiss ‘serious’ genres; making it hard for us to understand how the&#xA;  comedic and the dramatic can co-exist within the same artistic&#xA;  expression. But such incompatability of genres has by no means always&#xA;  been the case. Just as the monstrous gargoyle can inhabit the same&#xA;  cathedral wall as the saintly icon; or the irreverent doodle can adorn&#xA;  the exegetical manuscript – it cannot always be said that the presence&#xA;  of humour or whimsy within the medieval narrative was intended to&#xA;  undermine its psycho-dramatic potency. Indeed, more often than not,&#xA;  such flourishes signalled a generalised intensification of affect: a&#xA;  cultural experience in which all emotional registers (wonder,&#xA;  hilarity, excitement, fear etc.) were simultaneously subject to&#xA;  heightened stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, the fact that the story contains absurd jokes doesn't mean the story isn't serious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastEditorUserId="62" LastEditDate="2015-05-07T18:41:58.923" LastActivityDate="2015-05-07T18:41:58.923" CommentCount="2" />

And she brought forth long hills, graceful haunts of the goddess Nymphs who dwell amongst the glens of the hills. She bore also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontus, without sweet union of love. But afterwards she lay with Heaven and bore deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys.

It is said that, when Heracles was leading an expedition against Pylus in Elis, Athena was one of his allies. Now among those who came to fight on the side of the Pylians was Hades, who was the foe of Heracles but was worshipped at Pylus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[3] Homer is quoted in support of the story, who says in the Iliad: “And among them huge Hades suffered a wound from a swift arrow,&#xA;  When the same man, the son of aegis-bearing Zeus,&#xA;  Hit him in Pylus among the dead, and gave him over to pains.” Hom. Il. 5.395-397&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If in the expedition of Agamemnon and Menelaus against Troy Poseidon was according to Homer an ally of the Greeks, it cannot be unnatural for the same poet to hold that Hades helped the Pylians. At any rate it was in the belief that the god was their friend but the enemy of Heracles that the Eleans made the sanctuary for him.

Furthermore, near the mountain is a precinct sacred to Hades, which is revered by the Macistians too, and also a grove sacred to Demeter, which is situated above the Pylian plain. This plain is fertile; it borders on the sea and stretches along the whole distance between Samicum and the River Neda.

Wellhausen believed Yahweh to be the same as El, and more recently this has been particularly argued by F.M. Cross and J.C. de Moor. However, the following arguments may be brought against this. First, in the Ugaritic texts the god El is revealed to be wholly benevolent in nature, whereas Yahweh has a fierce as well as a kind side. Secondly, as T.N.D. Mettinger has rightly emphasized, the earliest evidence, such as that found in Judg. 5.4-5, associates Yahweh with the storm, which was not something with which El was connected at all. Rather, this is reminiscent of Baal. Thirdly, as for F.M. Cross's view that Yahweh was originally a part of El's cultic title, 'El who creates hosts' (&lt;em&gt;'il ḏū yahwī ṣaba'ōt&lt;/em&gt;), this is pure speculation. The formula in question is nowhere attested, whether inside or outside the Bible. Cross's reasons for thinking that &lt;em&gt;yhwh ṣb't&lt;/em&gt; cannot simply mean 'Lord of hosts', namely, that a proper name should not appear in the construct, is incorrect. Further &lt;em&gt;hyh (hwh)&lt;/em&gt; is not attested in Hebrew in the hiphil ('cause to be', 'create'), though this is case in Aramaic and Syriac. Yahweh in any case more likely means 'he is' (qal) rather than 'he causes to be/creates' (hiphil): to suppose otherwise requires emendation of the Hebrew text in Exod. 3.14 (&lt;em&gt;'ehyeh&lt;/em&gt;, 'I am'), which explains the name Yahweh. &lt;strong&gt;I conclude, therefore, that El and Yahweh were originally distinct deities that became amalgamated.&lt;/strong&gt; This view was held as long ago as F.K. Movers, and has been argued since by scholars such as O. Eissfeldt and T.N.D. Mettinger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=y-gfwlltlRwC&quot;&gt;Yahweh and the Gods and Goddesses of Canaan, John Day, 13-14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This section in the book is very well cited and I recommend following up on his different sources; it also goes on quite fascinatingly at some length, but to do so is outside the scope of this answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="11" LastEditorUserId="18" LastEditDate="2015-05-11T02:44:08.093" LastActivityDate="2015-05-11T02:44:08.093" CommentCount="1" />

They see many blessed sights in the inner heaven, and there are many ways to and fro, along which the blessed gods are passing, every one doing his own work; he may follow who will and can, for jealousy has no place in the celestial choir. But when they go to banquet and festival, then they move up the steep to the top of the vault of heaven. The chariots of the gods in even poise, obeying the rein, glide rapidly; but the others labour, for the vicious steed goes heavily, weighing down the charioteer to the earth when his steed has not been thoroughly trained:-and this is the hour of agony and extremest conflict for the soul. For the immortals, when they are at the end of their course, go forth and stand upon the outside of heaven, and the revolution of the spheres carries them round, and they behold the things beyond.&amp;mdash;Plato, &lt;a href=&quot;http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/phaedrus.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [246e-247c]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A plausible interpretation is that the twelve groups are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac#Hellenistic_and_Roman_era&quot;&gt;signs of the Zodiac&lt;/a&gt;.

Classical-period mythology used &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Question&quot;&gt;Homeric epics&lt;/a&gt; as it's base elements, but storytellers (such as Plato's Socrates) were free to create their own organizing structure.

There's no difference between that and the fox as an animal. As this would imply, the &lt;em&gt;kitsune&lt;/em&gt; are regarded as simply common foxes, though held to be naturally long lived and attributed with magical abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Chinese &lt;code&gt;hulijing&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;strong&gt;specifically a &quot;fox &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. They are no ordinary foxes, but instead the result of centuries or even millenia of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C4%81dhan%C4%81&quot;&gt;training&lt;/a&gt;. Some tales further describe them as engaging in powerleveling through essence-sucking intercourse with mortal humans à la western &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succubus&quot;&gt;succubi&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubus&quot;&gt;incubi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Classic of Mountains and Seas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for instance mentions that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;有獸焉，其狀如狐而九尾，其音如嬰兒，能食人；食者不蠱。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There is a beast, which is &lt;strong&gt;shaped like a fox&lt;/strong&gt; but has nine tails, and sounds like a baby. It eats men; eating it wards off evil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which clearly shows that the fox spirit is considered distinct from normal foxes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also a host of minor differences, such as the &lt;em&gt;kitsune&lt;/em&gt;'s reputed love for fried tofu versus the &lt;em&gt;hulijing&lt;/em&gt;'s preference for eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another major difference exists in the worship of the two entities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In traditional Japanese folklore, the &lt;em&gt;kitsune&lt;/em&gt; have an essential feature as messengers of the god of rice productivity and prosperity, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inari_%C5%8Ckami&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;inari ōkami (稲荷大神)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In Japan, however, the fox known as &lt;em&gt;kitsune&lt;/em&gt; has since the eight century been enshrined and worshipped in a pervasive network of sacred associations in connection with Inari. The widespread cult portrays &lt;em&gt;kitsune&lt;/em&gt; as a divine messenger of the rice god who promotes agrarian fertility as well as productivity and prosperity in a much broader sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt; - Heine, Steven. Shifting Shape, Shaping Text: Philosophy and Folklore in the Fox Kōan. University of Hawaii Press, 1999.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The association had formed as early as the 8th century and remains extremely strong to this day. The kitsune continues to feature in tens of thousands of Inari shrines across Japan, as recipients of fried tofu and rubbing by sickly miracle-seekers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ptysq.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;A stone &lt;em&gt;kitsune&lt;/em&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha&quot;&gt;Fushimi Inari Taisha&lt;/a&gt;, the chief shrine of the Inari god.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, in Chinese folklore fox spirits have a much more ambiguous standing. For instance &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji_Yun&quot;&gt;Ji Xiaolan&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;em&gt;Notes of the Thatched Abode of Close Observations&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;幽明異路，狐則在幽明之間。仙妖殊途，狐則在仙妖之間。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Dark and light are different, but foxes are between dark and light. Humans and objects are different, and foxes are between humasn &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_(Taoism)&quot;&gt;Hsien&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoguai&quot;&gt;Yao&lt;/a&gt; are different, but foxes are between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the worship of &lt;em&gt;kitsune&lt;/em&gt; in major shrines as messengers of a rice god, the foxes of China were prayed to in private homes as one of a group of five animal spirits. Exact compositions vary, but these typically includes  weasels, snakes, hedgehogs and rats. Families would offer sacrifices in the hopes of receiving protection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no real evidence that the Chinese and Japanese versions share a common origin. Fox worship is ancient in Japan; the earliest documentation of fox folklores appeared in the late 8th century &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Ry%C5%8Diki&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nihon ryōiki (日本霊異記)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lit. &lt;em&gt;Chronicles of Supernatural Tales of Japan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is almost as early as the first written works of any kind in Japan, and reelates the tale of a fox assuming the form of a woman and marrying a human. The tale claims the incident to be the origin of the term &lt;em&gt;kitsune&lt;/em&gt;, but that is almost certainly an invented etymology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;昔欽明天皇御世、三乃國大乃郡人應為妻、覓好孃乘路而行。時曠野中遇於姝女。其女媚壯、馴之壯睇之。言:「何行稚孃?」孃答:「將覓能緣而行女也。」壯亦語言:「成我妻耶?」女:「聽」答言、即將於家、交通相住。此頃懷任、生一男子。時其家犬、十二月十五日生子。彼犬之子每向家室、而期剋睚眥嘷吠。家室脅惶、告家長言:「此犬打殺。」雖然患告、而猶不殺。於二月三月之頃、設年米舂時、其家室於稻舂女等、將充間食入於碓屋。即彼犬將咋家室而追吠。即驚澡恐、成野干、登籠上而居。家長見、言:「汝與我之中子相生、故吾不忘汝。每來相寐。」故誦夫語而來寐。故名為岐都禰也。時彼妻著紅襴染裳、而窈窕裳襴引逝也。夫視去容、戀歌曰: 古比波未奈加我宇弊邇於知奴多万可支流波呂可邇美江天伊爾師古由惠邇。故其令相生子名、號岐都禰。亦、其子姓負、狐直也。是人、強力多有、走疾如鳥飛矣。三乃國狐直等根本是也。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(very roughly) During the reign of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Kinmei&quot;&gt;Kinmei Tennō&lt;/a&gt;, a man was looking for a bride and met a pretty woman who was looking for a husband. They started sleeping together and produced a baby boy on December 15. Tthe family dog gave birth too and the puppy was aggressive towards the woman, chasing her. Frightened, she turned into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanskritdictionary.com/?q=%C5%9B%E1%B9%9Bg%C4%81la&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yakan&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and fled. The man saw and pled, &quot;You and I have a child together, I cannot forget you. Come (&lt;code&gt;kitsu&lt;/code&gt;) back to sleep (&lt;code&gt;ne&lt;/code&gt;) at least.&quot; She agreed. This is where the name &lt;code&gt;kitsune&lt;/code&gt; comes from (...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese &lt;em&gt;kitsune&lt;/em&gt; ultimately absorbed elements, particularly of malice, from the Chinese &lt;em&gt;hulijing&lt;/em&gt;. Both traditions were further affected by the Indian version, which spread through both China and Japan by way of Buddhism. The Buddhist spirit &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakini&quot;&gt;ḍākinī&lt;/a&gt; for example was syncretised with native Inari worship to become a fox spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nine tailed fox, additionally, was introduced to Japan both as a general concept as well as a specific ancient fox spirit from India. It is said to have tried to overthrow an ancient Indian kingdom, and later brought about the Shang Dynasty's downfall as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daji&quot;&gt;Consort Daji&lt;/a&gt;.

In his dwelling place, in the pool, Mukiti heard the news that downstream from him there was a chief who had a sister called Iyangura.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(all quotes are from &lt;em&gt;A Treasury of African Folklore&lt;/em&gt;, the same source of the quotes in the question.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second piece of evidence is that once Mukiti marries Iyangura, he traps her in his village while he returns to his supernatural pool. This has nothing to do with Mwindo, who isn't even born yet:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[Mukiti] made a proclamation  saying &quot;You, all my people, if one day you see a man going downstream, then you will tear out his spinal column, you Banamaka, Banabirurmba, Banankomo, Banatubusa, and Banampongo; however, this path here which follows the flow of the river, it is the great path on which all people pass.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After he had passed this interdiction regarding these two paths, and while in his village there lives his Shemwami called Kasiyembe, Mukiti told his big headman Kasiyembe: &quot;You, go to dwell with my wife Iyangura at the borders of the pool; and I Mukiti shall from now on always reside here where all the dry leaves collect in flowing down, where all the fallen tree trunks are obstructed in the middle of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am still confused by the order about the &quot;path... which follows the flow of the river,&quot; but the rest seems clear to me. Mukiti has taken Iyangura to the edge of a supernatural pool, where he will live. He doesn't want anyone to take her from the supernatural world, so he has her live with his headman and instructs his subjects to stop people from approaching the village. I find it extraordinarily relevant that the pool is described as the place &quot;where all the dry leaves collect in flowing down&quot;: to me, it suggests that Mukiti and the pool are supernatural and exist at the center of the spiritual universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes where Mwindo sings about how he will defeat Mukiti:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For Mukiti shall I get out of my way?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  You see I am going to encounter Iyangura,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Iyangury, sister of Shemwindo.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Mukiti, you are powerless against Mwindo.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Mwindo is the Little-one-just-born-he-walked.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting story, but unfortunately the book I'm reading it from cuts the story off shortly after Mwindo meets his aunt. I'm going to have to get the full story from somewhere (the book I'm reading excerpts it from &lt;em&gt;The Mwindo Epic&lt;/em&gt;, translated and edited by Daniel Biebuyck and Kohombo Mateene).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2015-05-09T13:44:06.097" CommentCount="0" />

For example 666 would signify&#xA;  eternal unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the repetition is 3 times - three being the number of holiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The number 7 is extremely frequent in Christianity - the Book Of Revelations mentions 7 churches, 7 trumpets, 7 bowls, 7 seals and 7 spirits. This tends to confirm that 7 is used to make a &lt;em&gt;complete set&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In Greece and the origin of the 7 in Christianity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the reason about the origin of the number 7 in Egypt is hard to know, there are sources trying to explain where the 7 came to mean &quot;perfection&quot; in christian myths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Greeks considered 6 to be a perfect number, because of its &lt;strong&gt;divisibility&lt;/strong&gt;. A sixth is one, or unity. A third is two, a half is 3, etc. The foot is also a sixth of the human size, so 6 represented the human.

VII, no. 2. One of the reasons given for his fascination with the number is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.le.ac.uk/arthistory/seedcorn/faq-sds.html&quot;&gt;its presence in Antique history : the Seven Wonders, the seven stages of man, the seven planets...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The number Seven always represented a complete set.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This changed a lot - While Saint Augustine wrote that the world had been created in 6 days, this changed to 7 in the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason behind the Seven Sages of Greece seems thus not to be linked to mythology or religion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="139" LastEditorUserId="139" LastEditDate="2015-05-10T23:19:06.080" LastActivityDate="2015-05-10T23:19:06.080" CommentCount="4" />

On the unique Day of Atonement God (as יהוה and עזזאל ) was approached at both locations, there could not be even the slightest show of preference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In later times, God’s abode in the Temple or Jerusalem completely displaced God’s desert abode, relegating it to evil forces as was the belief in Near-Eastern cultures. In this process עזזאל , or a derivative of this name, became a satanic figure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is hardly the only available interpretation, but he makes a very compelling, and well-supported, case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastActivityDate="2015-05-10T04:47:32.967" CommentCount="2" />

Although the myth was known in Homeric times, its classic telling is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonautica&quot;&gt;Argonautica&lt;/a&gt;, the only surviving Hellenistic epic, written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Rhodes&quot;&gt;Apollonius of Rhodes&lt;/a&gt;. The oldest surviving version of the story can be found in Pindar's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0033.tlg002.perseus-eng1:4&quot;&gt;Pythian Ode IV: For Arcesilas of Cyrene Chariot Race 462 BC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the story, the party is first assembled in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iolcos&quot;&gt;Iolcos&lt;/a&gt;, when famed heroes of the era answer Jason's call for adventure. The story is noted for its moral ambiguity, a departure from the clear lines between good and evil in the Homeric epics. Whether the Argonauts are a party of heroes returning the Golden Fleece to its rightful place, or a bunch of pirates wreaking havoc for little more than personal gain is left to the reader to decide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the adventures themselves, although there's no definitive list of the Argonauts, here are some of the more interesting characters: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason&quot;&gt;Jason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The leader of the company is the only one of the adventurers who isn't an established warrior or craftsman at the beginning of the story. The Argonautica is essentially his coming of age story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus&quot;&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In modern RPG vernacular, the legendary poet would be the bard of the party. His songs soothe tensions amongst the crew, and he saves the day when the Argonauts encounter the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_%28mythology%29&quot;&gt;Sirens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_(son_of_Arestor)&quot;&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The builder of Argo, and also a member of her crew. It is heavily implied in the story that the journey would be impossible without Argus at the helm of the ship. He is the elder of the company, and the one Jason would more often turn to for counsel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea&quot;&gt;Medea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The echantress fulfils the role of Jason's love interest. She appears late in the story, and only joins the crew after they've retrieved the Golden Fleece. She &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absyrtus&quot;&gt;commits fratricide&lt;/a&gt; to help the crew escape Colchis and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mythology.stackexchange.com/q/218/57&quot;&gt;uses her magic to kill Talos&lt;/a&gt; and Pelias. If you are familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons&quot;&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, you'd probably think of Medea as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Neutral_Evil&quot;&gt;neutral evil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles&quot;&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The legendary brute doesn't feature much in the story, in Argonautica he's left behind in the first book. However, his role is crucial in the forming the company: The Argonauts, including Jason, elect him to lead their journey. However, Heracles passes the role to Jason, establishing the young adventurer's position atop the hierarchy of the company early on in the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this limited set is enough to show how diverse the members of the party were. This wasn't an army ordered to retrieve the Fleece, but a party brought together by a common sense of adventure. Although tensions between members were common, ultimately the combination of their unique strengths and skillsets lead them to success. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="57" LastEditorUserId="57" LastEditDate="2015-05-10T18:25:03.627" LastActivityDate="2015-05-10T18:25:03.627" CommentCount="0" />

The term derives from Germanic &lt;em&gt;*wtha&lt;/em&gt; and designates heathen shrines and sacred places in the widest sense of the word. Even the homes of the gods in mythological poetry of the &lt;em&gt;Edda&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Vafthruthnismol&lt;/em&gt;, 51) are called &lt;em&gt;vé&lt;/em&gt;, and the word occurs repeatedly in skaldic poetry....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Place-names reveal the wide distribution of shrines with the name &lt;em&gt;vé&lt;/em&gt; in Scandinavia: in Sweden there are more than 80 place-names based on &lt;em&gt;-vé&lt;/em&gt;, 18 of them found with the name of the god Ullr, 16 with Skaði, 8 with Freyr, but only 4 with Odin and 2 with Thor.

Fortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Adams_Bellows&quot;&gt;Henry Adams Bellows&lt;/a&gt; has already done such an analysis in the introduction to the Völuspá:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This final passage, in particular, has caused wide differences of opinion as to the date and character of the poem. That the poet was heathen and not Christian seems almost beyond dispute; there is an intensity and vividness in almost every stanza which no archaizing Christian could possibly have achieved. On the other hand, the evidences of Christian influence are sufficiently striking to outweigh the arguments of Finnur Jonsson, Müllenhoff and others who maintain that the Voluspo is purely a product of heathendom. The roving Norsemen of the tenth century, very few of whom had as yet accepted Christianity, were nevertheless in close contact with Celtic races which had already been converted, and in many ways the Celtic influence was strongly felt. &lt;em&gt;It seems likely, then, that the Voluspo was the work of a poet living chiefly in Iceland, though possibly in the &quot;Western Isles,&quot; in the middle of the tenth century, a vigorous believer in the old gods, and yet with an imagination active enough to be &lt;strong&gt;touched by the vague tales of a different religion&lt;/strong&gt; emanating from his neighbor Celts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source:&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe03.htm&quot;&gt;Völuspá, The Poetic Edda, tr.

Note also that Ask and Embla were created out of trees (Ash and Elm), reminscient of the &lt;em&gt;Garden&lt;/em&gt; of Eden but giving it an Icelandic spin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;17&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Here the poem resumes its course after the interpolated section. Probably, however, something has been lost, for there is no apparent connection between the three giant-maids of stanza 8 and the three gods, Othin, Hönir and Lothur, who in stanza 17 go forth to create man and woman. The word &quot;three&quot; in stanzas 9 and 17 very likely confused some early reciter, or perhaps the compiler himself. Ask and Embla: ash and elm; Snorri gives them simply as the names of the first man and woman, but says that the gods made this pair out of trees.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source:&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe03.htm&quot;&gt;Völuspá, The Poetic Edda, tr.

One indication of this disappearance is the well-known scarcity of references to the traditional &lt;em&gt;flamines&lt;/em&gt; in imperial sources. &lt;strong&gt;Even if we grant that these &lt;em&gt;flamines&lt;/em&gt;, especially the &lt;em&gt;flamines minores&lt;/em&gt;, may have been indifferent towards mentioning their priesthood in the inscriptions, or may rather have been interested in mentioning it in a different guise (because the flaminates themselves had no longer 'communicable prestigious potential'), this would only serve to prove that they had ceased to be significant personal foci of the deity.&lt;/strong&gt; This may have happened because the cult itself was in decline, or because the traditional focalization of the cult through the &lt;em&gt;flamines&lt;/em&gt; had been abandoned or shifted elsewhere. Those &lt;em&gt;flamines&lt;/em&gt; who were attested, may well owe their attestation to a certain popularity of the &lt;em&gt;feriae&lt;/em&gt; of the god they represented, but statistics are too limited for further conclusions, although it is a fair guess to say that some flaminates existed until at least the beginning of the second century A.D.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This indicates that the &lt;em&gt;flamines&lt;/em&gt; had fallen by an even greater extent during the time of the Roman Empire, after the Republic. Some of the reasoning expressed here could be applied during the Republican period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamen#Flamines_minores&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has another explanation (uncited):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The flamines minores seem mostly connected to agriculture or local cults. The change to an urban way of life may explain why these deities lost their importance or fell into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One more explanation is given in &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=Rfl6MqQJpDwC&amp;amp;pg=PA80&amp;amp;lpg=PA80&amp;amp;dq=flamines+minores+end&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=d4XSV1-6pn&amp;amp;sig=lwwtnX4JCSn4Xr8vP3ANI3VdqdY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=6DdSVa-7OouxggTqg4GQAw&amp;amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=flamines%20minores%20end&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A commentary on Cicero's oration De haruspicum responso&lt;/em&gt;, by John O.

She is the proper Titan-goddess of the Moon, often even the personnification of the moon itself. See among many other sources, Apollonius Rhodius's &lt;em&gt;Argonautica&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Rising from the distant east, the Lady Selene (Moon), Titanian goddess...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanisPhoibe.html&quot;&gt;Phoibe/Phoebe&lt;/a&gt;. The Titan Phoibe doesn't actually seem to be associated with the moon, the confusion comes from Selene being often nicknamed Phoebe (i. e. &lt;em&gt;'bright'&lt;/em&gt;). Phoibe was apparently a prophetess Titan-goddess and as such is supposed to have held the Oracle of Delphi at some point. From the first line of Aeschylus's &lt;a href=&quot;http://classics.mit.edu/Aeschylus/eumendides.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eumenides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;THE PYTHIAN PRIESTESS&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  First, in this prayer, of all the gods I name&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  The prophet-mother Earth; and Themis next,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Second who sat-for so with truth is said-&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  On this her mother's shrine oracular.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Then by her grace, who unconstrained allowed,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  There sat thereon another child of Earth-&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Titanian Phoebe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Hekate.html&quot;&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;. Now Hecate is something else I think. The different sources we have tend to contradict each other on her parentage, descendance, attributions etc. leading some scholars to think that Hecate was in fact a goddess foreign to the Greek Pantheon that was only added later (and well integrated thanks to the place Hesiod gave her in the &lt;em&gt;Theogony&lt;/em&gt;). See for instance what Sarah Johnston says about it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.de/books?id=qbihKIJw_OUC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Restless Deads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Let us go back further, to Hecate's place of origin. There is general agreement that this was Caria, in southwestern Asia Minor, which is supported by the fact that by the Hellenistic period her precinct in Lagina was the largest of all the precincts there (in constrast, in all of Greece, only Aegina seems to have had any significant sanctuary devoted wholly to Hecate).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caria being in southwestern Anatolia.&#xA;Similarly (from the list I mentioned earlier), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Pasiphae.html&quot;&gt;Pasiphae&lt;/a&gt; seems to have been the cretan moon-goddess and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Thrakios/Bendis.html&quot;&gt;Bendis&lt;/a&gt; the one from Thrace.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The specific reason why Hecate was associated with the moon seems a bit complex. Originally, in Caria, Hecate seems to have been a fairly generic mother Goddess. Even in Hesiod's &lt;em&gt;Theogony&lt;/em&gt; she is presented as having dominion over basically everything:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For to this day, whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favour according to custom, he calls upon Hecate. [...] For as many as were born of Earth and Ocean amongst all these she has her due portion. The son of Cronos did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds, as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to Sarah Johnston in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.de/books?ei=9FlUVd7JLce5UbrxgcgH&amp;amp;id=pyp-AAAAMAAJ&quot;&gt;Hekate Soteira: A Study of Hekate's Role in the Chaldean Oracles and Related Literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (which I haven't been able to find and thus read so I might be misrepresenting her idea here), the association came relatively late (1st Century AD) from the fact that at some point Hecate was seen as a &quot;&lt;em&gt;liminal&lt;/em&gt;&quot; goddess, an intermediary between two worlds (hence also probably the association between Hecate and witchcraft), which is a quality that was supposedly shared by the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, the difference between Selene and Artemis is that one &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;  the moon while the other is just associated with it, and on top of that one is a Titan while the other is an Olympian; Phoebe has nothing to do with the moon; and the others are foreign/regional goddesses integrated &lt;em&gt;a posteriori&lt;/em&gt;  into the Greek Pantheon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="111" LastEditorUserId="111" LastEditDate="2015-05-14T08:53:28.703" LastActivityDate="2015-05-14T08:53:28.703" CommentCount="2" />

The material derives from both single and multiple burials with individuals treated in different ways. The genetic analyses show that the individuals buried together were unlikely to be maternally related, and stable isotope analyses suggest different strata of society. It is, therefore, suggested that slaves may have been offered as grave gifts at Flakstad. A comparison with the remaining population from single graves shows that the presumed slaves had a diet similar to that of the common population, whereas the high status individuals in multiple graves had a diet different from both slaves and the common population. The results provide an insight into the subsistence of different social groups in a Viking Age society, exposing unexpected patterns of living conditions and food distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440313003117&quot;&gt;Slaves as burial gifts in Viking Age Norway?

The four Yugas known as Satya, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali together make up one Mahayuga, and a thousand Mahayugas make up one Kalpa or day of Brahma.  But in addition to being divided into 1000 Mahayugas, a Kalpa is also divided into fourteen Manvantaras, each of which is made up of about 71 Mahayugas.  We're currently living in the seventh Manvantara of the present Kalpa, known as the Vaivasvata Manavantara, and we're living in the 28th Kali Yuga of the Vaivasvata Manvantara.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have some background, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=nckrAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;dq=%2224th%20treta%22&amp;amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;this chapter&lt;/a&gt; of the Matsya Purana (an important Hindu scripture), various incarnations of Vishnu in the present Vaivasvata Manvantara are described.  But Kalki is only mentioned once, and that is in the current Kali Yuga.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indianscriptures.com/Content/Articles/PDFs/27478/62f_chapter_19_2.pdf#toolbar=0&amp;amp;pagemode=none&amp;amp;view=FitBH&amp;amp;page=1%22&quot;&gt;This excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from the Skanda Purana says the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we can find explicit references to how Kali Yugas have ended in the past.  In particular, &lt;a href=&quot;http://Even%20the%20great%20ascetic%20Rama,%20the%20hero%20worshipped%20by%20all%20heroes,%20that%20son%20of%20Jamadagni,%20of%20great%20fame,%20will%20die,%20without%20being&quot;&gt;this chapter&lt;/a&gt; of the famous Hindu epic the Mahabharata describes how Vishnu's incarnation Parashurama brought about the end of the 19th Kali Yuga of the Vaivasvata Manvantara by killing the kings of the world:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Even the great ascetic Rama, the hero worshipped by all heroes, that son of Jamadagni, of great fame, will die, without being contented (with the period of his life). &lt;strong&gt;Rooting out all evils from the earth, he caused the primeval Yuga to set in.&lt;/strong&gt; Having obtained unrivalled prosperity, no fault could be seen in him. His father having been slain and his calf having been stolen by the Kshatriyas, he without any boast, slew Kartavirya who had never been vanquished before by foes. With his bow he slew four and sixty times ten thousand Kshatriyas already within the jaws of death. In that slaughter were included fourteen thousand Brahmana-hating Kshatriyas of the Dantakura country, all of whom he slew. Of the Haihayas, he slew a thousand with his short club, a thousand with his sword, and a thousand by hanging. Heroic warriors, with their cars, steeds, and elephants, lay dead on the field, slain by the wise son of Jamadagni, enraged at the slaughter of his father. And Rama, on that occasion, slew ten thousand Kshatriyas with his axe. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, as far as I know there was only one other occasion where Vishnu took a Kalki incarnation.  The Kalki incarnation was named Pramati, and he seems to have lived in the Swayambhuva Manvantara, the first Manvantara of the present Kalpa.  (The Kalki incarnation who is going to come in present Kali Yuga will be named Vishnuyasha.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you're interested in those lists of Vaivasvata Manvantara incarnations found in the Matsya and Skanda Puranas, I've posted a few questions about them on Hinduism.SE, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7192/36&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7194/36&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7221/36&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="14" LastEditorUserId="14" LastEditDate="2015-06-15T01:30:49.627" LastActivityDate="2015-06-15T01:30:49.627" CommentCount="0" />

Then, striding to the head of the bridge, conspicuous amongst the fugitives who were clearly seen to be shirking the fight, he covered himself with his sword and buckler and made ready to do battle at close quarters, confounding the Etruscans with amazement at his audacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Yet were there two who were prevented by shame from leaving him. These were Spurius Larcius and Titus Herminius, both famous for their birth and their deeds. With these he endured the peril of the first rush and the stormiest moment of the battle. But after a while he forced even these two to leave him and save themselves, for there was scarcely anything left of the bridge, and those who were cutting it down called to them to come back. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi0012.perseus-eng1:10&quot;&gt;Titus Livius (Livy), The History of Rome, Book 2, Benjamin Oliver Foster, Ph.D., Ed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Plutarch&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Horatius Cocles, however, first, and with him two of the most illustrious men of the city, Herminius and Lartius, defended the wooden bridge against them. Horatius had been given his surname of Cocles because he had lost one of his eyes in the wars. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Some, however, say that his nose was flat and sunken, so that there was nothing to separate his eyes, and his eye-brows ran together, and that for this reason the multitude wished to call him Cyclops, but by a slip of the tongue the name of Cocles became generally prevalent instead. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This Cocles, standing at the head of the bridge, kept the enemy back until his companions had cut the bridge in two behind him. Then, all accoutred as he was, he plunged into the river and swam across to the other side, in spite of a wound in the buttocks from a Tuscan spear. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Publicola, out of admiration for his valour, proposed that every Roman should at once contribute for him as much provision as each consumed in a day, and that afterwards he should be given as much land as he could plough round in a day. Besides this, they set up a bronze statue of him in the temple of Vulcan, to console him with honour for the lameness consequent upon his wound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Publicola*.html&quot;&gt;The Life of Publicola, The Parallel Lives by Plutarch, published in Vol. I of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1914&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;While they were all fleeing to the city and endeavouring to force their way in a body over a single bridge, the enemy made a strong attack upon them; and the city came very near being taken by storm, and would surely have fallen if the pursuers had entered it at the same time with those who fled. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Those who checked the enemy's attack and saved the whole army were three in number, two of them older men, Spurius Larcius and Titus Herminius, who commanded the right wing, and one a younger man, Publius Horatius, who was called Cocles from an injury to his sight, and one of his eyes having been struck out in a battle, and was the fairest of men in philosophical appearance and the bravest in spirit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This man was nephew to Marcus Horatius, one of the consuls, and traced his descent from Marcus Horatius, one of the triplets who conquered the Alban triplets when the two cities, having become involved in war over the leadership, agreed not to risk a decision with all their forces, but with three men on each side, as I have related in one of the earlier books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These three men, then, all alone, with their backs to the bridge, barred the passage of the enemy for a considerable time and stood their ground, though pelted by many foes with all sorts of missiles and struck with swords in hand-to-hand conflict, till the whole army had crossed the river.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When they judged their own men to be safe, two of them, Herminius and Larcius, their defensive arms being now rendered useless by the continual blows they had received, began to retreat gradually. But Horatius alone, though not only the consuls but the rest of the citizens as well, solicitous above all things that such a man should be saved to his country and his parents, called to him from the city to retire, could not be prevailed upon, but remained where he had first taken his stand, and directed Herminius and Larcius to tell the consuls, as from him, to cut away the bridge in all haste at the end next the city (there was but one bridge in those days, which was built of wood and fastened together with the timbers alone, without iron, which the Romans preserve even to my day in the same condition), and to bid them, when the greater part of the bridge had been broken down and little of it remained, to give him notice of it by some signals or by shouting in a louder voice than usual; the rest, he said, would be his concern. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Having given these instructions to the two men, he stood upon the bridge itself, and when the enemy advanced upon him, he struck some of them with his sword and beat down others with his shield, repulsing all who attempted to rush upon the bridge. For the pursuers, looking upon him as a madman who was courting death, dared no longer come to grips with him. At the same time it was not easy for them even to come near him, since he had the river as a defence on the right and left, and in front of him a heap of arms and dead bodies.

Early published versions were based on less complete information, and had to make assumptions that turned out incorrect, especially with regards to Dumuzi's (Tammuz) role in the story (See: Kramer's explanation of the decipherment in &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0060908548&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this print version&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/3265029&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Tammuz and the Bible&quot;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will be using &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0060908548&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wolkstein and Kramer's translation&lt;/a&gt; of the text, published in 1983.  Both because it's excellent and well-explained, and because it's the one sitting on my desk.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.uncw.edu/deagona/myth/Descent%20Of%20Inanna.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Full text here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we could take Inanna (Ishtar) at her word.  Her overt reason is given:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Inanna answered:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &quot;Because . . . of my older sister, Ereshkigal,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Her husband, Gugulanna, the Bull of Heaven, has died.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  I have come to witness the funeral rites.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Let the beer of his funeral rites be poured into the cup.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Let it be done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That, however, is just the excuse she gives at the gate.  It doesn't seem likely this is her real reason for the trip.  More likely the real reason is shown here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;From the Great Above she opened her ear to the Great Below.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  From the Great Above the goddess opened her ear to the Great Below.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  From the Great Above Inanna opened her ear to the Great Below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which gives us the hint that she has heard the Great Below, the underworld, in some way.  Wolkstein's explanations, however, give us more to go on:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Inanna is the Queen of Heaven and Earth, but she does not know the underworld.  Until her ear opens to the Great Below, her understanding is necessarily limited.  In Sumerian, the word for ear and wisdom is the same ... In order to fully appreciate or &quot;know&quot;  what is said or meant, a great understanding is needed - an understanding of all things.  It is the Great Below, and knowledge of death and rebirth, life and stasis, that will make Inanna an &quot;Honored Counselor&quot; and a guide to the land.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So Inanna, already powerful and knowledgeable of Heaven and Earth, needs to acquire knowledge of death and the underworld to be complete in her wisdom.  This is further supported later, from the statement of Enlil, when hearing that Inanna has not returned from the underworld:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My daughter craved the Great Above.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Inanna craved the Great Below.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  She who receives the &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; of the underworld does not return.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  She who goes to the Dark City stays there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here Enlil (and later, Nanna, in an identical statement) states that Inanna has gone seeking the &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; of the underworld.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/726/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-word-me-in-the-descent-of-inanna&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; is a tricky word&lt;/a&gt; that most translators refuse to translate, and too much can be said about it to address completely here.  Suffice to say, the &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; represent knowledge and wisdom.  So, the gods know that she has gone seeking that knowledge that can only be gained in the underworld.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To go just one more step, a &lt;em&gt;very popular&lt;/em&gt; interpretation of the text is through a Jungian lens.  Just to hit the main points very briefly.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal of gaining wisdom of the underworld, to complement the wisdom of the heavens and of the earth, speaks of Inanna becoming complete, but this interpretation views it, instead of her completing her body of knowledge, she is completing herself, developing into a &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; person (goddess).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this light, we see Inanna and her sister Ereshkigal as part of the same whole person.  In order to become complete, Inanna must become vulnerable, and face the dark side of herself (Ereshkigal), die and be reborn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inanna abandons her temples on the way to the underworld, and has to leave her crown, robe and other vestments (also &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Like I said, complicated) at the gates of the underworld.  She arrives naked, powerless and vulnerable.  The death and rebirth are fairly clear to be read, but of particular interest is that after Inanna's death, and preparing for rebirth, Ereshkigal is in pain &quot;With the cries of a woman about to give birth.&quot;  Which does rather speak to the interpretation of being reborn from her darker half.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2015-06-12T21:22:51.103" LastActivityDate="2015-06-12T21:22:51.103" CommentCount="2" />

Then the young man's sixteenth birthday approaches (or was it some other day symbolizing the coming of age?), and Apollo wants to give him the best present a mortal has ever had. But he is neither powerful enough to grant the best, nor wise enough to know what the best is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apollo then goes to Zeus and asks him to give his friend the best present on his special day. Zeus agrees and Apollo tells his friend, both awaiting the day with happy apprehension. But then, on the birthday, the young boy is struck by lightning. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apollo is very angry and demands an explanation of Zeus. The explanation: Zeus killed the boy on the happiest day of his life, before he had met the sorrow of the drudging adult routine. This was the best present a mortal could have. Apollo understands this and mourns his friend. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have forgotten the name of the boy.

At the time that Cain killed Abel, then, it is plausible to conclude that Cain just killed half of the rest of the human race. It's bad enough to kill someone else, worse to kill them over the quality of sacrifices and God's acceptance of them, worse still to kill your own brother, and then you add in the fact that Cain killed one of only four humans alive at the time. Cain has committed one of the greatest crimes imaginable. He is very much deserving of death, and he has good reason to be fearful of others that might want to take vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The identity of the others.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Who are these others, you might ask? Well...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;3 When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth. 4 After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;6 When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father of Enosh. 7 After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;~ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%205&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;Genesis 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would conjecture that Cain lived about as long as Seth, give or take a couple hundred years.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Supposing somewhat arbitrarily that Cain lived 800 years, in that time the family tree would be at least &lt;strong&gt;six&lt;/strong&gt; levels deep just from Seth's branch. The following people would have been born in Cain's lifespan: Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, and Methusaleh. This is not counting the other sons and daughters &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; of them had. Including Adam, incidentally. To get a rough, lower-bound estimate for the number of descendants of Seth alive in Cain's time, I'm going to assume that each son had five children, three of whom are sons.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This leads to &lt;strong&gt;at least 1215&lt;/strong&gt; people alive in Cain's lifetime who would have had reason to find him and kill him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's a lower bound. Adam and Eve also had &quot;other sons and daughters&quot; (which would bump up the population to at least 4000), and Cain himself had progeny. We're talking at least &lt;strong&gt;5000&lt;/strong&gt; people living before Cain died, a significant portion of which might want to kill him. It is also quite possible that Adam and Eve already had other children by the time they had Cain, and in either case, Cain was probably smart enough to realize that there would be other people that would want to kill him, even if they hadn't been born yet. Hence, his fear is justified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Now that's a phrase you won't hear often regarding human lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Given the lack of a prohibition against incest, which didn't appear until Moses' time&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, I'm going to assume that the daughters very well might have married brothers/cousins.

He goes on at great length about the time of Arthur, describing some of his later exploits after defeating &quot;a pagan people from Angla&quot; with the help of Hoel, king of Brittany:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Soon after this struggle he subdued the Scots and, changing the direction of his campaign, the war-like Irish. He overcame all nations in the expeditions he led. He brought into subjection both the Norwegians who lived far across the broad seas and the Danes whom he sought out with his dreaded fleet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He brought the people of France under his rule after killing Frollo, to whose care the country had been committed by those in power at Rome. He even fought and defeated the Romans themselves when they were preparing a campaign against his kingdom. He killed the procurator Lucius Hiberius, who had become the colleague of Emperor Leo and had come on the Senate's orders to bring the French territories back under its authority.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;During this time the faithless and foolhardy guardian of our realm, Modred, had begun to take over the kingdom and to carry on an unlawful love affair with the king's wife. The king, it is said, had entrusted the kingdom and the queen to Modred's care when about to leave on a campaign against his enemies overseas. When the report of this great crime reached his ears, he gave up his intended campaign and returned home, landing with many thousands of men. He attacked his nephew and drove him abroad in flight.

This is due chiefly to the increasing significance of the role of Osiris, for whom drowning becomes instrumental to his revivification and deification. As Hopfner observes: “only after death by drowning could he [Osiris] become a god.” It is thus the myth of Osiris—and more significantly his death and resurrection at the hands of his enemy, Seth-Typhon—that underpins the motif of apotheosis by drowning that we meet in the magical papyri.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also worth mentioning, there is one significant example of a drowning in the Nile leading to a good and proper Roman state deification, complete with widespread cult.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous#Deification_and_the_cult_of_Antinous&quot;&gt;Antinous&lt;/a&gt;, a lover of Emperor Hadrian, died by downing in the Nile.

His cult spread to at least 70 cities, and at least 115 scultures of him are known to survive today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first blog linked in your question seems to have conflated these two somewhat, although I didn't really give it a thorough read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastActivityDate="2015-05-17T00:59:00.817" CommentCount="0" />

This man, through cunning art rather than by valour, first attaches to his guilty rule certain neighbouring countries or provinces against the Roman power, by nets of perjury and falsehood. He then extends &lt;strong&gt;one wing to Spain, the other to Italy,&lt;/strong&gt; fixing the throne of his iniquitous empire at Trier, and raged with such madness against his lords that he drove two legitimate emperors, the one from Rome, the other from a most pious life. Though fortified by hazardous deeds of so dangerous a character, it was not long ere &lt;strong&gt;he lost his accursed head at Aquileia:&lt;/strong&gt; he who had in a way cut off the crowned heads of the empire of the whole world.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Picts and Scots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;14&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;After this, &lt;strong&gt;Britain is robbed of all her armed soldiery, of her military supplies, of her rulers, cruel though they were, and of her vigorous youth who followed the footsteps of the above-mentioned tyrant and never returned.&lt;/strong&gt; Completely ignorant of the practice of war, she is, for the first time, open to be trampled upon by two foreign tribes of extreme cruelty, the Scots from the north-west, the Picts from the north; and for many years continues stunned and groaning.[21]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vortigernstudies.org.uk/arthist/vortigernquotesgil.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&lt;/em&gt;, St. Gildas, 13-14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This sounds like the same story as &lt;em&gt;The Dream of Macsen Wledig&lt;/em&gt; (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And immediately the emperor set forth with his army. And these men were his guides. &lt;strong&gt;Towards the Island of Britain they went over the sea and the deep. And he conquered the Island from Beli the son of Manogan,&lt;/strong&gt; and his sons, and drove them to the sea, and went forward even unto Arvon. And the emperor knew the land when he saw it. And when he beheld the castle of Aber Sain, &quot;Look yonder,&quot; said he, &quot;there is the castle wherein I saw the damsel whom I best love.&quot; And he went forward into the castle and into the hall, and there he saw Kynan the son of Eudav, and Adeon the son of Eudav, playing at chess. And he saw Eudav the son of Caradawc, sitting on a chair of ivory carving chessmen. And the maiden whom he had beheld in his sleep, he saw sitting on a chair of gold. &quot;Empress of Rome,&quot; said he, &quot;all hail!&quot; And the emperor threw his arms about her neck; and that night she became his bride.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  ...&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Seven years did the emperor tarry in this Island. Now, at that time, the men of Rome had a custom, that whatsoever emperor should remain in other lands more than seven years, should remain to his own overthrow, and should never return to Rome again.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  So they made a new emperor. And this one wrote a letter of threat to Maxen. There was nought in the letter but only this. &quot;If thou comest, and if thou ever comest to Rome.&quot; And even unto Caerlleon came this letter to Maxen, and these tidings. Then sent he a letter to the man who styled himself emperor in Rome. There was nought in that letter also but only this. &quot;If I come to Rome, and if I come.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;strong&gt;And thereupon Maxen set forth towards Rome with his army, and vanquished France and Burgundy, and every land on the way, and sat down before the city of Rome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/macsen.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Dream of Macscen Wledig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the historical figure is the same as the story's figure, we can talk a little about the history.

The empire fell approximately 90-120 years later.

Ο Άρης αντιπροσώπευε αναρχικές διαμάχες, την βία του πολέμου, ενώ η Αθηνά πιστευόταν ότι είχε διδάξει στην ανθρωπότητα τις τεχνικές και τους κανόνες του πολέμου. Ως αποτέλεσμα, τα δυο αδέλφια συχνά περιγράφονταν από αρχαίους συγγραφείς σε μια κατάσταση διαμάχης και αυτό ήταν ιδιαίτερα αληθινό κατά την διάρκεια του Τρωικού πολέμου.&#xA;  &lt;hr&gt;&#xA;  The combative nature of Athena because of which she was worshipped, &lt;strong&gt;differentiated from the nature of Ares&lt;/strong&gt;, the god of war. &lt;strong&gt;Ares represented anarchist struggles, the violence of war&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;while Athena was believed to have taught mankind the techniques and the rules of war&lt;/strong&gt;. As a result, the two brothers often were described by ancient writers in a conflict situation and that was especially true during the Trojan war.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm&quot;&gt;Ekivolos.gr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares&quot;&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; never became a patron god and was not worshipped as much as the other gods initially, although he was established as a god of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenism_%28religion%29&quot;&gt;Dodekatheon&lt;/a&gt; later on, tied to people who had tough and violent customs: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Όπως ήταν φυσικό, καμιά πόλη δεν τον έκανε πολιούχο της ενώ δεν ήταν ιδιαίτερα αγαπητός και στον κύκλο των υπολοίπων θεών. Για τους αρχαίους Έλληνες ο Άρης ήταν η κυρίαρχη φιγούρα πίσω από την βία, τις μάχες και τις άλλες διαμάχες μεταξύ των ανδρών.  Η «αίρεση» και η συνακόλουθη λατρεία  του θεού μάλλον άρχισε στην Θράκη όπου σύμφωνα με τον Όμηρο ζούσε ο Άρης. Από εκεί η λατρεία  του εξαπλώθηκε στην Βοιωτία και μετά σε ολόκληρη την Ελλάδα ολοκληρωτικά, οδηγώντας στην καθιέρωση του Άρη ως ενός  από τους δώδεκα θεούς του Ολύμπου. Οι ιδιότητες του Άρη συνδέονται με τις ρίζες του αφού, για τους αρχαίους Έλληνες, η Θράκη ήταν ένα μέρος σκληρών ανθρώπων και εθίμων.&#xA;  &lt;hr&gt;&#xA;  Naturally, no city made him a patron god and he was not as popular as the other gods. For the ancient Greeks Ares was the dominant figure behind violence, battles and other conflicts among men. The &quot;heresy&quot; and the subsequent worship of God began in Thrace [&lt;em&gt;a region in Northern Greece&lt;/em&gt;] where, according to Homer, Ares lived. From there, the cult spread to Viotia [&lt;em&gt;Another region of Greece&lt;/em&gt;] and then throughout Greece completely, leading to the establishment of Ares as one of the twelve gods of Olympus. The properties of Ares were associated with its roots since, for the ancient Greeks, &lt;strong&gt;Thrace was a place of hard people and customs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm&quot;&gt;Ekivolos.gr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, that ancient Greeks had two war gods in order to demonstrate that a subtle technique of conducting war is a lot more efficient than brute force.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Σε αντίθεση με την Αθηνά που επινοούσε μεθοδικούς τρόπους για να κηρύττει και να διεξάγει  πόλεμο, ο Άρης αγαπούσε τις αιματοχυσίες και τις χαοτικές μάχες. Στον Τρωικό πόλεμο, ο Άρης τραυματίστηκε σοβαρά από την Αθηνά καθώς βοηθούσε τους Τρώες, αποδεικνύοντας έτσι ότι η τεχνική ήταν ικανή να υπερνικήσει την ωμή βία.&#xA;  &lt;hr&gt;&#xA;  Unlike Athena who invented methodical ways to preach and to conduct war, Ares loved bloodshed and chaotic battles. In the Trojan war, Ares was seriously injured by Athena as he was helping the Trojans, &lt;strong&gt;thus proving that technique was able to overcome brute force.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm&quot;&gt;Ekivolos.gr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29" LastEditorUserId="29" LastEditDate="2015-05-19T22:12:51.490" LastActivityDate="2015-05-19T22:12:51.490" CommentCount="0" />

One possible explanation is as follows:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the Norse shamanic tradition, Odin's ravens represent the powers of necromancy, clairvoyance and telepathy, and they were guides for the dead. This poem expresses the shaman's fear of his loss of magical powers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Well of Remembrance by Ralph Metzner, Shambala, Boston, 1994&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it is implied the name of one of the ravens is mistranslated:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s often claimed that Munin’s name means “Memory,” but for this to be so, it would have to be derived from minni&lt;/strong&gt;, “memory,” &lt;strong&gt;rather than munr, “desire.”&lt;/strong&gt; The latter, however, is by far the more parsimonious derivation; if the former were the case, we should expect Munin’s Old Norse name to have been something like “Minninn” rather than “Muninn.” Moreover, &lt;strong&gt;the above verse from the Grímnismál makes much more sense if Munin’s name means “Desire” rather than “Memory”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/others/hugin-and-munin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Norse Mythology for Smart People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another possible explanation is the following, which is similar to first one:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthony Winterbourne&lt;/strong&gt; connects Huginn and Muninn to the Norse concepts &lt;strong&gt;of the fylgja—a concept with three characteristics; shape-shifting abilities, good fortune, and the guardian spirit—and the hamingja—the ghostly double of a person that may appear in the form of an animal.&lt;/strong&gt; Winterbourne states that “&lt;strong&gt;The shaman’s journey through the different parts of the cosmos is symbolized by the hamingja concept of the shape-shifting soul, and gains another symbolic dimension for the Norse soul in the account of Oðin’s ravens, Huginn and Muninn.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ljmoore.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/my-travels-with-huginn-and-muninn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;My Travels with Huggin and Munnin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Simek&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rudolf Simek&lt;/a&gt; has an entirely different point to make, saying that the names of the ravens were only used in later times:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rudolf Simek is critical of the approach&lt;/strong&gt;, stating that &lt;strong&gt;&quot;attempts have been made to interpret Odin's ravens as a personification of the god's intellectual powers, but this can only be assumed from the names Huginn and Muninn themselves which were unlikely to have been invented much before the 9th or 10th centuries&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; yet that the two ravens, as Odin's companions, appear to derive from much earlier times. &lt;strong&gt;Instead, Simek connects Huginn and Muninn with wider raven symbolism in the Germanic world, including the Raven Banner (described in English chronicles and Scandinavian sagas), a banner which was woven in a method that allowed it, when fluttering in the wind, to appear as if the raven depicted upon it was beating its wings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huginn_and_Muninn#Theories&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29" LastEditorUserId="810" LastEditDate="2016-05-19T14:01:50.263" LastActivityDate="2016-05-19T14:01:50.263" CommentCount="0" />

The paper fills in the established locations of the camps of Ulster and Connacht:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slemain Midhe (camp of Ulster) - Slanemore Hill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clathra (camp of Connacht) - Clare Hill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the author gives one location as the most likely location of the battle, as well as giving mention to a second possible location posited in an older resource, supposed supported by local tradition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garthy - The suggestion by the author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washford Bridge - The suggestion by an earlier researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two are less than 10 km apart, so pretty close.  No statement as to the hills in question though.  A speculation can be found here or there, but nothing that seems worth crediting.  It's not too hard to see the problem.  The author of the above paper describes the surrounding areas as &quot;gently undulating enclosed farmland&quot;.  Indeed, taking a quick look at a topographic map of the vicinity:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/n1Ol3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google topographic map of the areas&quot; title=&quot;You call those hills?&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which reveals not much going on.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_of_Uisneach&quot;&gt;Ushnagh Hill&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the most dramatic hill in the area.  It's the gentle incline just to the right of the &quot;Killare&quot; label on the map.  The hill does appear to have quite a storied history, but I can't find any compelling reason to assume it is one of those mentioned in the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2015-05-23T07:20:10.247" LastActivityDate="2015-05-23T07:20:10.247" CommentCount="0" />

However, keep in mind the following three things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It wasn't easy: the characters have to achieve several supposedly impossible magical tasks in order for Kilhwch to be able to marry Olwen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;These characters are accustomed to magic (the relationship between the real world and the magical world is a common theme in the Mabinogion).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A central theme in the story is the control of reproductive power. This story features a &quot;jealous stepmother&quot; motif; to quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mabinogion.info/culhwch.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Will Parker's Mabinogion.info&lt;/a&gt; (which quotes Stephen Knight's Culhwch analysis):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The threat represented in the essential plot of the story us the failure of the family to reproduce itself. The stepmother’s curse means Culhwch will either go childless or be killed by the giant … the central fear [is] of a sterile generation and of reproductive power lying in enemy hands, whether giants or stepmothers. (Arthurian Literature and Society Macmillan Press, 1963 pp 16-18)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story is, in a way, a precursor to stories like Cinderella: the stepmother wants to control the father, so she controls the father's children with his first wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know why the crone first concealed Kilhwch (Culhwch) from the stepmother, and then revealed Kilhwch to her.

I want to ask you about Hermes, since Cratylus says I am not Hermogenes (son of Hermes). Let us investigate the name of Hermes, to find out whether there is anything in what he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socrates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Well then, this name “Hermes” seems to me to have to do with speech; he is an interpreter (ἡρμηνεύς) and a messenger, is wily and deceptive in speech, and is oratorical. All this activity is concerned with the power of speech. Now, as I said before, εἴρειν denotes the use of speech; moreover, Homer often uses the word ἐμήσατο, which means “contrive.” From these two words, then, the lawgiver imposes upon us the name of this god who contrived speech and the use of speech—εἴρειν means “speak” and tells us: “Ye human beings, he who contrived speech (εἴρειν ἐμήσατο) ought to be called Eiremes by you.” We, however, have beautified the name, as we imagine, and call him Hermes. Iris also seems to have got her name from εἴρειν, because she is a messenger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg005.perseus-eng1:408&quot;&gt;Plato, Cratylus, p.408&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hermes was the messenger of the gods, and naturally writing would be essential to him. He isn't however credited with inventing writing, at least not until Roman times: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[143] CXLIII. PHORONEUS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Inachus, son of Oceanus, begat Phoroneus by his sister Argia, and he is said to have been the first of mortals to rule. Men for many centuries before lived without town or laws, speaking one tongue under the rule of Jove. But after Mercury had explained the languages of men (when he is called ermeneutes, “interpreter,” for Mercury in Greek is called Hermes; he too, divided the nations), then discord arose among mortals, which was not pleasing to Jove. And so he gave over the first rule to Phoroneus, because hew as first to make offerings to Juno.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[277] CCLXXVII.

It is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Go&quot;&gt;very old game&lt;/a&gt;: although the first occurrence of this game in chinese literature date from the 4th century BC, legends date its origins in the 2nd millenium BC. Consequently, due to its age, it is a game that one encounter frequently in eastern Asia legends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Links between the game and astrology/astronomy are legions, due to the inherent look of a game in progress. In fact, in modern japanese, the central point of the board is referred to as the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tengen&quot;&gt;tengen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (litt. origin of Heaven) and the other marked intersections as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://senseis.xmp.net/?Hoshi&quot;&gt;hoshi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (litt. stars).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chinese historian Ban Gu (32-92 AD) in &lt;em&gt;Yi Zhi&lt;/em&gt; (Essence of Go) wrote about the game:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The board must be square, for it represents the Earth laws. The lines must be straight for they embody the spirit of pure virtue. The pieces are white and black, and so are divided into the Yin and the Yang. Paired and set out in order, they represent the patterns of the Heavens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, gods are often pictured playing the game, in Chinese and Japanese tradition: see piece of arts like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laurabordignon.co.uk/japanese-art/d/japanese-ivory-okimono-of-hotei-god-of-wealth-playing-the-game-g%C3%85%C2%8D-with-jurojin-god-of-longevity/80735&quot;&gt;this sculpture of Hotei, god of Wealth, playing against Jurojin, god of longevity&lt;/a&gt; or the Yuan Dynasty painting representing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lacma.org/sites/default/files/Chinese_Paintings_LACMA_Checklist_PartTwo.pdf&quot;&gt;Three Stars Playing Weiqi&lt;/a&gt;, just to give a couple of examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to finish, on the idea of an ever lasting game, there is this famous (among go player) legend that approaches this idea: the &lt;em&gt;Ranka&lt;/em&gt; story.

When the lumberjack returned home, he discovered that so much time had gone by in his absence, that everyone he knew had long since perished.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is therefore possible that the story you read was a mishmash of legends about the game of go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="111" LastEditorUserId="111" LastEditDate="2015-05-25T11:18:33.727" LastActivityDate="2015-05-25T11:18:33.727" CommentCount="0" />

Although the characterization is somewhat coarse and unimaginative, Monkey is from then on a permanent fixture in the framework of the stories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several theories on where does this character come from, the main theories being that he derives from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp081_monkey_sun_wukong.pdf&quot;&gt;indian monkey-god Hanuman&lt;/a&gt;, or that his roots can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.de/books?id=bNo8AAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PP2&amp;amp;ots=GCxeBPQWjA&amp;amp;dq=The%20Hsi-yu%20chi%3A%20A%20Study%20of%20Antecedents%20to%20the%20Sixteenth-Century%20Chinese%20Novel&amp;amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Fukien cult of Ch'i-t'ien Ta-sheng&lt;/a&gt;, some link Sun Wukong with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2719331.pdf&quot;&gt;monkeys worshipped in Lingyin Si&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whichever theory is correct, it seems that the path Sun Wukong followed is not actually from fantasy novel to mythology/folklore but instead from mythology to novel, and then only to mythology/folklore again.&#xA;And whichever theory is correct, the fact remains that the post-&lt;em&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/em&gt; Sun Wukong and whichever monkey-god he originally was are significantly different, as he was completely reshaped by the novel(s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concerning the novel to mythology transition, here is what Whalen Lai (1994) says about it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1178559.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protean Ape to Handsome Saint: the Monkey King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We scholars may think  of Monkey as nothing  more than a literary creation, but the  common folk of China know better.  To us,  a text  is just  a text,  but to  them &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt; is more than fable:  it tells of reality.  The  Sage  Equal to  Heaven  is  a living  reality, as real as St. Christopher is to an old-time  Catholic.  As  St.  Christopher still protects travelers, Monkey still  answers prayers.  Monkey  has  his  own temple; he was worshipped  and prayed to  as a god by the  history-making rebels of  the  Boxer  Rebellion.  This  Great  Sage is still  present to  those  who have eyes to  see  and  ears to  hear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="111" LastEditorUserId="111" LastEditDate="2015-06-01T13:52:46.590" LastActivityDate="2015-06-01T13:52:46.590" CommentCount="0" />

Tolkien:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fairy,&lt;/em&gt; as a noun more or less equivalent to &lt;em&gt;elf,&lt;/em&gt; is a relatively modern word, hardly used until the Tudor period. The first quotation in the Oxford Dictionary (the only one before A.D. 1450) is significant. It is taken from the poet Gower: &lt;em&gt;as he were a faerie.&lt;/em&gt; But this Gower did not say. He wrote &lt;em&gt;as he were of faerie,&lt;/em&gt; &quot;as if he were come from faerie&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The source for this is his noted essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://excellence-in-literature.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fairystoriesbytolkien.pdf&quot;&gt;&quot;On Fairy Stories&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, pp 3 (PDF). (I have taken one liberty in transcribing it: the PDF to which I linked appears to have dropped the italics. Tolkien used italics heavily; my memory of first reading &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; includes that customary italicization; so I have attempted to recreate it as best I can. If I got it wrong, that's on me.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's bracing to hear a professional imply that the use of the term &quot;fairies&quot; stems mainly from a publisher's error. Tolkien certainly knew his field, and was probably familiar with the occasional accident in transcription carrying large linguistic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, Tolkien did not hesitate to place Feerie - the land, not the inhabitants - in its proper place in mythology &amp;amp; folklore. From the same essay, on page 4:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Faerie contains many things besides elves and fays, and besides dwarfs, witches, trolls, giants, or dragons: it holds the seas, the sun, the moon, the sky; and the earth, and all things that are in it: tree and bird, water&#xA;  and stone, wine and bread, and ourselves, mortal men, when we are enchanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That rather magnificent bit of wordsmithing outlines the beginning's of Tolkien's theme for the essay. I won't issue spoilers, but this admittedly fairly long piece might be of considerable interest to mythology.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="379" LastActivityDate="2015-06-01T14:44:51.787" CommentCount="0" />

Historically, this has been particularly prevalent in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian&quot;&gt;Fukien&lt;/a&gt;, but stories similar to Sun Wu Kong's backstory can be found in several regions. &lt;strong&gt;This predates the &lt;em&gt;c.&lt;/em&gt; 1592 &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but the popularity of that novel furnished the traditional monkey deity with a standardised (sort of) backstory and the name Sun Wu Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roots of the modern monkey deity worship certainly predates the late 16th century fictional work, however. From about the late Yuan dynasty, elements of traditional folklore were incorporated into fictional works. A play by the Mongolian playwrite Yang Jing-xian, confusingly also titled &lt;em&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/em&gt;, contains an autobiographic line by a certain &lt;em&gt;&quot;Itinerant Monk Sun&quot;&lt;/em&gt; (recycled into the much later novel as a common title for Sun Wu Kong):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;《元·楊景賢·西遊記·第三本》小聖弟兄、姊妹五人，大姊驪山老母，二妹巫枝祗聖母，大兄齊天大聖，小聖通天大聖，三弟耍耍三郎&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have five brothers and sisters.

Both names do however appear for the monkey brothers in contemporary works such as the play &lt;code&gt;二郎神鎖齊天大聖&lt;/code&gt; or the novella &lt;code&gt;陳從善梅嶺失渾家&lt;/code&gt;. They are also found in an archaeological site on Baoshan mountain in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunchang_County&quot;&gt;Shunchang, Fukien&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Twin Sages Tomb. it's located near the Southern Heaven Gate, a temple first built in 1391 and rebuilt in 1548, which some scholars argue are the upper and lower bounds for the tomb's age.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/fAYW6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;(順昌寶山雙聖墓 - Twin Sages Tomb, at Baoshan, Fukien)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The inscriptions are difficult to read from the photo, but the left is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_tablet&quot;&gt;spirit tablet&lt;/a&gt; for a certain &lt;em&gt;Heaven Reaching Great Saint&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code&gt;通天大聖&lt;/code&gt;), while the right is for the more familiar &lt;em&gt;Heaven Rivaling Great Saint&lt;/em&gt;. The positioning (left is senior) and style of the steles matches the play's version that the &lt;em&gt;Heaven Reaching Great Saint&lt;/em&gt; is the younger brother.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this basis it is thought that the &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt;'s character of Sun Wukong - and the monkey deity - is in fact &lt;strong&gt;an amalgamation of both Great Sages and their sister, &lt;em&gt;Wu Zhiqi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; That is in fact a considerably more ancient name, tracing back to at least ninth century. During the Tang Dynasty, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Gongzuo&quot;&gt;Li Gongzu&lt;/a&gt;, a fantasy novelist who penned the famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Governor_of_Nanke&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Governor of Nanke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, wrote that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;《唐·李公佐·古岳讀經》 禹理水，三至桐柏山，驚風走雷，石號木鳴，五伯擁川，天老肅兵，不能興。禹怒，召集百靈，搜命夔龍，桐柏千君長稽首請命，禹因囚鴻蒙氏、章商氏、兜盧氏、犁婁氏，乃獲淮渦水神，名無支祁，善應對言語，辨江淮之淺深、原隰之遠近。形若猿猴，縮鼻高額，青軀白首，金目雪牙，頸伸百尺，力逾九象，搏擊騰踔疾奔，輕利倏忽，聞視不可久，禹授之章律，不能制，授之鳥木由，不能制，授之庚辰，能制。鴟脾桓木魅水靈，山妖石怪，奔號聚繞，以數千載，庚辰以戰逐去，頸鎖大索，鼻穿金鈴，徙淮陰之龜山之足下&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;While trying to control the flood, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great&quot;&gt;Yu&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongbai_County&quot;&gt;Tongbai&lt;/a&gt; thrice ... [there he] captured the river god of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huai_River&quot;&gt;Huai&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;It is named Wu Zichi and shaped like a money&lt;/strong&gt;, with a sunken forehead and tall nose, a green body and white face, golden eyes and white teeth ... With a chain tied around his neck, [the monkey] was imprisoned under the Turtle Mountain of Huai.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it might only be his own fictional invention, the story was collected into &lt;code&gt;戎幕閒談&lt;/code&gt;, a compilation of strange tales by the Tang writer Wei Xuan (&lt;code&gt;韋絢&lt;/code&gt;), as the explanation for a supposed incident he heard:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;時有漁人，夜釣於龜山之下，其釣因物所制，不複出。漁者健水，疾沉於下五十丈，見大鐵鎖，盤繞山足，尋不知極，遂告湯。湯命漁人及能水者數十，獲其獲，力莫能制，加以牛五十餘頭，鎖乃振動，稍稍就岸。時無風濤，驚浪翻湧，觀者大駭，鎖之末，見一獸，狀有如猿，白首長口，雪牙金爪，闖然上岸。高五丈許，蹲踞之狀若猿猴，但兩目不能開，兀若昏昧，目鼻水流如泉，涎沫腥穢，人不可近。久乃引頸伸欠，雙目忽開，光彩若電，顧視人焉，欲發狂怒，觀者奔走，獸亦徐徐引鎖，拽牛入水去，竟不複出&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A fisherman was fishing by the Turtle Mountain at night. His hook was caught on something and would not budge. Knowing how to swim, he dived in 50 yards, and saw a seemingly endless, large iron chain surrounding the foot of the mountain. He reported what he saw to the governor, who sent dozens of swimmers and more than 50 bulls to pull the chain out. There was no wind at the time, but to the shock of bystanders huge waves formed on the river. &lt;strong&gt;At the end of the chain, there was a beast, shaped like a monkey/ape, white faced and long moused, white teeth and golden eyes.&lt;/strong&gt; He stumbled onto the shore, some five yards tall, moving like a monkey but with his eyes closed ... [after a while] his eyes suddenly opened, looking around like lightening, and looked around like he's about to go on a rampage. Everyone started running off, and he slowly walked back into the water, dragging the bulls with him, and vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Tang scholar Li Zhao records in his &lt;em&gt;Addendum to Tang Histories&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code&gt;唐國史補&lt;/code&gt;) that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;楚州有漁人，忽于准中釣得古鐵鎖，挽之不絕，以告官。刺史李陽大集人力引之。鎖窮，有青獼猴躍出水，复沒而逝。後有驗《山海經》云：水獸好為害，禹鎖于軍山之下，其名曰無支奇&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A fisherman from Chu found an old iron chain in the Huai River. He pulled on it but it went on endlessly, so he reported it to the government. The governor gathered many men to pull. At the end of the chain, a green monkey lept out of the water, then vanished. Consulting the &lt;em&gt;Classics of Mountains and Seas&lt;/em&gt; found a passage saying: A water beast was being a pest, and Yu locked it under the Jun Mountain. &lt;strong&gt;Its name is Wu Zichi.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Classics of Mountains and Seas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cited in the last passage is an ancient bestiary that dates back as far as the fourth century &lt;em&gt;B.C.&lt;/em&gt;, but the extant versions do not contain this supposed quote. It is quite possible that this part is a fabrication - citing old documents lend credence to the story. Nonetheless, the numerous references to the story suggests that, while the specifics might be inventions of writers, the idea of a monkey river god was an established concept in Chinese folklore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are obvious parallels with the Sun Wukong character from the &lt;em&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/em&gt;. The imprisonment under a mountain is particularly notable, and the physical description of the monkey Wu Zichi's golden eyes is an obvious precursor to Sun Wukong's fabled true seeing Flaming Eyes and Golden Iris (&lt;code&gt;火眼金睛&lt;/code&gt;). These similarities are why Wu Zichi is widely considered the origin of Chinese folk religion's monkey deity, the Great Sage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative school of thought argues that the Great Sage was inspired by the Hindu monkey god &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman&quot;&gt;Hanuman&lt;/a&gt;. Whether a native Wu Zichi absorbed influences of Hanuman, or whether Wu Zichi itself was inspired by Hanuman, is a matter of some scholarly debate. Regardless of the true sequence of events, a tradition of a monkey deity most likely found itself transplanted from India into China. An (originally) &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty&quot;&gt;Tang&lt;/a&gt; era Hindu-Buddhist &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiyuan_Temple_(Quanzhou)&quot;&gt;Kaiyuan Temple&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanzhou&quot;&gt;Zayton&lt;/a&gt; contains a stone mural widely considered to depict Sun Wu Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/YbyFZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;(泉州開元寺仁壽塔 - Renshou Pagoda, rebuilt in 1237, at the Kaiyuan Temple, Fukien.)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &quot;Itinerant Monk Sun (Monkey)&quot;, as the mural is often called, predates &lt;em&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/em&gt; by centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the Ming Dynasty, Fukien has been a primary source of Chinese emigration and colonialisation.

Here is what he says about its relationship with the north star:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The top of the world pillar, or the world pillar as a whole, is identified with the polar star. Basic here is the observation that, in the northern sky, the stars revolve as if around a fixed point. It is believed that this point is the upper end of the world pillar, provided with an iron needle around which the sky circles. This needle is the mechanism for the rotation of the sky, and is thereby easily identified with the polar star.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  The distribution of the pertinent traits shows that while the concept of the polar star as the fixed point of the world pillar seems to be common to the whole circumpolar area, the idea of the needle is only represented among Eurasian sub-Arctic peoples. [...]&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  The nail on the world column, or what we here conveniently could call the &quot;world nail&quot;, has apparently been a widely distributed Eurasian concept. All sources at our disposal hint that this nail was identical with the polar star. This holds for the Saamis, the Esthonians, the Samoyeds, the Chuckchee and the Koryak. It is furthermore most interesting that the polar star has been called world pillar. Thus, as Harva has noted, Mongols, Buryats, Kalmucks, Altai Tatars and Uigurs call the polar star &quot;the golden pillar&quot;, Kirghis, Bashgirs and other Tatars name it &quot;iron pillar&quot;, the Teleuts &quot;the lone post&quot; and the Orotchi (Tungus) &quot;the golden post&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the origin of the concept, according to Hultkrantz:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The world pillar, we may insist, genuinely represents an archaic, circumpolar world view. Since circumpolar culture, besides being an adaptation to the Arctic and sub-Arctic environment, typifies a culture of mesolithic-palaeolithic origins it seems probable that the world pillar and associated mythic-ritual complex may be traced back to this time and age.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="111" LastActivityDate="2015-06-05T07:05:40.747" CommentCount="0" />

As such, its meaning is complex, and a lot has been written about both Aztec music in general and the specific meaning of the breaking of the flutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most basic interpretation is that the breaking of the flutes simply represents the death of the sacrificial victim/avatar of the god on earth:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What then do the flutes, flute playing, and the physical breaking of the flutes by the player himself signify? Not only is a painful death the end of the happiness of earth, but the flute also symbolizes all that is humanly and spiritually powerful, as Carrasco explains: &quot;The sound of the flute, as with the word, depends on the exhalation of the breath or, in Nahua thought, the soul.&quot; Therefore, the soul of the sacrificial victim who represented the &quot;god of gods&quot; is forever lost with his death and by his own breaking of the flutes that represented his soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Olsen, Dale A., &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=3bUPBAAAQBAJ&quot;&gt;World Flutelore: Folktales, Myths, and Other Stories of Magical Flute Power&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is further supported by the fact that flutes were a metaphor for flowers, meaning that the act of breaking the flute was analogous to picking a flower (i.e. killing them, but preserving their &quot;essence&quot; like preserving a flower in a vase):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the particular Aztec ceramic duct flute... performed by the young impersonator of Tezcatlipoca is called a &quot;flower flute&quot; because it has a flared distal end that represents a flower blossom. Furthermore, the flower... symbolizes beauty, blood offering, and music, according to Arnd Adje Both:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the heart of a deity impersonator itself was compared to a flower, metaphorically &quot;plucked&quot; and offered in ritual human sacrifice. Analogously the impersonator &quot;plucked&quot; the flutes before his own death, as symbolized in breaking the bells from the tube over the stairway and leaving them as undamaged as possible. This act of ritual destruction is clearly evident by organological data and could be interpreted as a process of transformation into the spiritual realm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=3bUPBAAAQBAJ&quot;&gt;Olsen&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures of the flower shaped flutes used in the ritual (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mixcoacalli.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/both_2002.PDF&quot;&gt;Arnd Adje Both's fantastic pdf about the instruments&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mixcoacalli.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/both_2002.PDF&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/4yOFP.png&quot; alt=&quot;Drawings of Aztec flutes.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/xFCZH.png&quot; alt=&quot;Aztec flute playing posture.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another interpretation focuses on the use of music to communicate with the gods. In fact:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Some musical instruments were considered to be sounding idols, indicating that ritual music could be perceived as a voice of the gods, and that the Aztec instrumentalist fulfilled the role of an expert mediator through whom a god sang. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Both, Arnd Adje, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/41699767&quot;&gt;Aztec Music Culture&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The importance of music is further emphasized by the myths that discuss the origin of music. In Central American myths, music is stolen from gods (often with the help of Tezcatlipoca, and gives humans the power to communicate with the spiritual realm:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;An interesting myth... related that originally music was the property of the sun. After the sacrifice of the gods in Teotihuacan, men gathered their remains and made sacred bundles out of them, but they did not know how to adore them. Tezcatlipoca created Ehecatl (Wind), whom he entrusted with the task of going to the house of the sun to bring the musicians there to the earth. Water goddesses, the nieces of Tezcatlipoca, build a bridge [sic] so that Ehecatl could reach the abode of the sun. The musicians were warned not to answer the intruder with the &quot;mellifluous song,&quot; but in spite of these warnings, one of the musicians succumbed to the charm of the song and followed the envoy of Tezcatlipoca. That was the origin of music and prayers on the earth, thanks to which men could adore the gods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the Popol Vuh, the noise of the ball game provokes the ire of the underworld masters of Xibalba; several modern myths give the same function to the song and music played by the hero... Thus the noise from the ball game, smoke, and music all have parallel functions. They manifest the acquisition of cultural goods, which constitute a king of usurpation of the power of the creator gods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Oliver, Guilhem, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academia.edu/8645965/_The_Hidden_King_and_the_Broken_Flutes_the_Mythical_and_Royal_Dimension_of_Tezcatlipocas_Feast_in_Toxcatl_en_Representing_Ritual_Performance_Text_and_Image_in_the_Work_of_Sahag%C3%BAn_Eloise_Qui%C3%B1ones_Keber_coord._Niwat_University_of_Colorado_Press_2002_pp._107-142&quot;&gt;The Hidden King and the Broken Flutes: the Mythical and Royal Dimension of Tezcatlipoca's Feast in Toxcatl&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also supported by the Aztec connection between flowers and music (which we've previously discussed when comparing the shape of the flutes to flowers). The scent of flowers and the sound of music are analogous in Aztec culture, as both allow humans to communicate with their deities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Aztec concept of music as a “flowery song” is reflected in the calyx-shape of the flower-flute. To play it allows to visualize the metaphorical link between sound and the scent of blossoms, both regarded as sacrificial gifts functioning as a means of communication with the spiritual realm, probably because of their invisible sensual quality. That the ruler was compared to the flute, through which Tezcatlipoca could express his will, makes the important social function of the instrument evident and shows that instrumental sound was perceived as the proper voice or ‘flowery song’ of a deity. Thus, the flutist fulfilled the role of a mediator. It can be proposed that he was sacrificed instead of the ruler.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Both, Arnd Adje. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mixcoacalli.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/both_2002.PDF&quot;&gt;Aztec Flower-Flutes: The Symbolic Organization of Sound in Late Postclassic Mesoamerica&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, breaking of the flutes represents a pause in communication with the gods, which is then reinstated after the sacrifice occurs. (I think it's also reasonable to interpret the breaking of the flutes as briefly returning the gift of music to the gods, and thereby thanking them for said gift.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Recall that in the myth the envoy-counterpart of Tezcatlipoca descended from the abode of the sun and offered music to the people so that they could adore their gods. In the ritual, the representative of Tezcatlipoca returned toward the sun [i.e. walked back up the temple] and broke the flutes. By breaking them on the temple steps, he foresaw his own death by becoming one with the instrument. With his death the possibility of contact with the god was broken, and only with the coming of a new representative would it be possible to reestablish a link between gods and humans.

The Nahua peoples believed that we are born with a physical heart and face, but that we have to create a deified heart and a true face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Nicholson, Irene. &lt;em&gt;Mexican and Central American Mythology&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ceremony was a myth acted out in real life. The myth was about man, who must learn to glorify god through sensual things, through fine clothes and music and dance, before he is worthy of breaking the senses one by one and losing his life in order to gain it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Nicholson.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This interpretation of the breaking of the flutes reminds me of the following quote about art:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The poet and critic Allen Grossman tells a story (there are many versions of the story) that goes like this: you’re moved to write a poem because of some transcendent impulse to get beyond the human, the historical, the finite. But as soon as you move from that impulse to the actual poem, the song of the infinite is compromised by the finitude of its terms. So the poem is always a record of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Lerner, Ben. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n12/ben-lerner/diary&quot;&gt;On Disliking Poetry&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now we've come full circle: a reason why flutes are so important is that music allows humans to express themselves. Breaking a flute is the equivalent to killing someone as they can not speak nor communicate with the gods. However, the breaking of the flute also represents both an interruption of divine communication &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; (as argued by Nicholson) an attempt at a rebirth into a realm where flutes aren't necessary, because there is direct communication with the spiritual realm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of that theology makes the human sacrifices performed by the Aztecs ethical, but it helps us understand their perspective better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastEditorUserId="62" LastEditDate="2015-06-13T02:00:05.400" LastActivityDate="2015-06-13T02:00:05.400" CommentCount="0" />

It is interesting to note that even though the quack doctor performed witchcraft in a largely catholic country, he was still a widely accepted and beloved character.

This tendency is largely due to the many instances of Catholic hagiology (mythology about the Saints) appearing much like myths from earlier pagan times &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; Christianity had heavy influence over the area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is very likely some level of influence, however, &lt;strong&gt;it is Christianity that influenced myths about Loki.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The earliest Norse myths involving Loki portray a character that is certainly a trickster, but not malicious. There are many instances of Loki engaging in a good deal of intentional mischief, but also resourceful and helpful, giving inventions to humans, and eventually resolving his mostly harmless mischief. However, by the 10th century, after nearly 200 years of significant Christian influence, Loki's myths make him out to be a much darker character. In a myth involving a character named Baldr (who was certainly influenced by Christian depictions of Jesus), Loki is an evil specimen that murders Baldr out of jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When they capture Loki, he is held in a prison until Ragnarok (the Norse apocalypse that was also likely influenced by Christianity) and tortured by having a perpetual stream of snake venom drip into is face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loki's evil nature and jealousy (of a Christ like image especially) and his ultimate tortuous imprisonment was undoubtedly influenced by Christian perceptions of Satan.&lt;/strong&gt; In Christian mythology, Satan is evil. And the eschatology (apocalyptic theology) revolving around him involves an eternity of torment, which is undoubtedly because of his heinous misdeeds against God, humanity, and the rest of creation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This progression for trickster gods to take on a darker persona as the centuries pass is actually quite common (Satan in Job, for example, is not necessarily evil, but is certainly an accuser and adversary, but by Revelation he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; patently evil). It is therefore expected that Loki would become more like Satan as Christianity influenced the Norse mythos, because Satan had already progressed into a personification of evil centuries earlier. Without Christian influence, Loki still likely would have become more evil and less trickster, so the rising influence of Christianity in Norse areas and Loki's conversion to an evil character may have been coincidental, however it does seem likely that Christianity at least hastened the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SOURCES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=i_AcX5Znv6cC&amp;amp;pg=PA65&amp;amp;lpg=PA65&amp;amp;dq=how%20did%20christianity%20influence%20loki&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=AhrGkhMI-T&amp;amp;sig=aAVpfHl_Q9imD5cYN9A7x9DtMp4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwjmttfryovGAhUNmYgKHVwBAGQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=how%20did%20christianity%20influence%20loki&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - &quot;The parallels between Loki and Satan are striking but are for the most part Christian coloring of paganism rather than the opposite.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rewild.com/anthropik/2006/06/the-trickster-the-devil-and-an-ambiguous-world/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trickster, the Devil, and an Ambiguous World&lt;/em&gt; - The Anthropik Network&lt;/a&gt; - &quot;It’s fairly easy to divide stories about Loki into two historical categories: pre-Christianity, and post-Christianity.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=j6jABAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PT28&amp;amp;lpg=PT28&amp;amp;dq=how%20did%20christianity%20influence%20loki&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=PjDgMl1QoH&amp;amp;sig=aPwf-G8MX9-cSxDwWtiTHKxSKtQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCDgKahUKEwjmttfryovGAhUNmYgKHVwBAGQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=how%20did%20christianity%20influence%20loki&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Brief History of the Vikings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - &quot;By the [10th century], Loki had perhaps been influenced by several centuries of Christian lore, and was now seen as a far more devilish figure that he may originally have been.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=Cn6pWMverBIC&amp;amp;pg=PA478&amp;amp;lpg=PA478&amp;amp;dq=how%20did%20christianity%20influence%20loki&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=uH2Z1vtWds&amp;amp;sig=lOmVFmDB4MDkDMHnz4bvam_wSv8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCTgKahUKEwjmttfryovGAhUNmYgKHVwBAGQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=how%20did%20christianity%20influence%20loki&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Archetypes and Motifs in Folklore and Literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - &quot;Tales of Loki's evil and binding are clearly influenced by the later Christian identification of Loki and the Devil (tricksters, perhaps because of their profane character, are often equated with the Devil if their original culture is converted to Christianity).&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15507a.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Völuspá&lt;/em&gt; - New Advent&lt;/a&gt; - &quot;Balder, the innocent god, is treacherously slain through the machinations of the wicked Loki.&quot; and &quot;Christian influence is not only possible, but certain.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/religion_01.shtml&quot;&gt;Viking Religion - BBC History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NOTES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://polytheist.com/orgrandr-lokean/2014/09/23/a-new-place-for-loki-part-ii/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A New Place for Loki, Part II&lt;/em&gt; on Polytheist.com&lt;/a&gt; states that &quot;since Loki was a deity who I believe was originally responsible for carrying burnt sacrifices to the gods and freeing the souls of the dead via cremation, it is only natural that the Catholic Church would have found him particularly deplorable.&quot; There are many sources for the article, but I have not looked through them.

(My theory is that this is actually linguistic misunderstanding: the original Sanskrit calls him &quot;neela&quot; coloured, which back then refered to any dark colour, black or dark blue or dark green; by the time of these illustrations though, the common languages had &quot;neela&quot; meaning just blue.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this can be given from two viewpoints:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;from a historical view, the reason there's so much variation is (a) these texts were generally written by poets in the Bhakthi tradition, which is all about emotion and personal connection with God rather than analytical accuracy (b) Hinduism has absorbed various local beliefs through time, and allowed them all place within itself, turning those regional Gods into forms of the original Hindu Gods (so for eg. when Maariyamma மாரியம்மா a Tamil regional Goddess was taken in as a form of Goddess Parvati, Parvati acquired her dark skin as one of her colours). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;from a philosophical view, it is a constant reminder to not get attached to the form of the God, that names and forms (Naama-Roopa) - even those of Gods - are only products of Maya, and the Truth is beyond such limitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="449" LastEditorUserId="79" LastEditDate="2015-06-18T03:33:56.177" LastActivityDate="2015-06-18T03:33:56.177" CommentCount="0" />

When they had encircled the boar, the animal killed Hyleus and Ankaios, and Peleus accidentally speared Eurytion [king of Phthia] with his javelin. Atalanta was first to hit the boar, in the back with an arrow. Amphiaraus then got it in the eye, and Meleager killed it with a blow on the flank. When he received the skin, he gave it to Atalanta. But the sons of Thestius, who considered it disgraceful that a woman should get the trophy where men were involved, took the skin from her, saying that it was properly theirs by right of birth, if Meleager chose not to accept it. Outraged by this, Meleager slew them and again gave the skin to Atalanta. But Althaea, in grief over the death of her brothers, set fire to the brand [that the Fates declared when consumed would end the life of Meleager, otherwise he would have lived forever], and Meleager died on the spot.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another variant preserved by Ovid's &lt;em&gt;Metamorphoses&lt;/em&gt; is that Meleager instead killed his brothers Plexippus and Toxeus, who were the ones that took it from Atalanta.

In fact, there are books written devoted to just this narrative. It's frankly impossible to answer, however, I've outlined some of the theories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, god prefers blood sacrifices. Surely we must have, at least at some layer, some etiological myth that explains why the ancient Hebrews used lambs, bulls, and birds for sacrifices instead of more mundane objects like vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Others have noted that it may preserve a tradition of backlash against the introduction of agriculture in the region. Abel's offerings would be the offerings of a semi-nomadic shepherd, while Cain's is indicative of a farmer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some like Frazer thinks this is a fertility narrative, and God's rejection has nothing to do with the original story except to serve as a device for moving the narrative. The real story is the slaughter of Abel, whose blood &quot;fertilizes&quot; the earth. This is apparent in the Greek translation (which actually may precede the &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt;, Masoretic text of the Old Testament, or at least is a translation of an earlier Hebrew text), which has Cain and Abel in a field, and—in both Greek and Hebrew—the earth &quot;opened her mouth to receive [Abel's] blood,&quot; which offers evidence of fertilizing the field. As Hooke notes, the Mark of Cain is symbolic of a larger plan of Yahweh's, that this was &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to happen, probably so not as to condemn all farmers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hooke also points out some Near Eastern parallels, though they're rather tenuous. One is the Babylonian New Year Festival, in which after slaughtering a lamb, two priests smear blood on the walls of a shrine, &quot;after which they are obliged to flee into the...desert until the Festival is over, because they are defiled by their ritual act.&quot; Instead of a lamb, though, the ancient Hebrews may have sacrificed a human, though this again seems far-fetched to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ancient commentators, writing long afterward, would not have thought of this. Indeed, most, like Philo or Didymus or even Hellenistic Jewish writings, state or imply that Cain's offerings were rejected because &lt;em&gt;Cain himself&lt;/em&gt; was evil, and thus warranted rejection. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some starting points for further research:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;J.

If Abel worked the soil, his offering would have been favored. The key is that Abel gave the best of him - the firstborn. Cain did not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say, you are a father and you have two children. You love them both and know too well. You've seen them grow. One gives you the best of his. You will surely know that it's his best, because you've seen them so much, you know what they consider precious and what they don't like. Another gives you something he doesn't like. It's still okay because you love him, but if he pretends like it's his best, you won't be pleased, not because you don't love him, but because he's lying. The Cain and Abel case is similar to this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Offering and the one who gives offering are not separated. If the offerer is defiled, the offering is defiled too. If the offerer is sanctified, the offering is too. Everything of you have impacts on the offering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Leviticus, God instructs how you make various offerings on various situation: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you offer fine flours as a gift to God (Lev 2): It must be 'fine' flours and it's not easy to grind fine flours especially in the old times. He also has to pour oil on it. And again, it's not easy to extract oil in the old times. If the offerer is with a thankful heart, he will do it with a joy and it won't be a chore to him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And sin offering via animal sacrifices (Lev 4): the sacrificer puts his hands on the animal, and kills the animal by himself. It signifies that even though he should be dead because of his sin, but the animal is killed on behalf of him and his sin. He repents while doing so and it's accepted. If not, it's not an offering but a slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These knowledge are expressed throughout the whole Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the New Testament mentions Abel. Heb 11:4 says, 'By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice.'&#xA;And there are all kinds of faith in the same chapter: faith on God's very existence, his goodness, his joy, his love, his righteousness, his faithfulness, his vision, and his power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It may look fuzzy, but it's really about having a personal relationship with God. God is not an object. If you have a healthy relationship with Father or Mother, how you are going to express your thankfulness to them? How about when you feel sorry? How about to your Husband or Wife? With God, you are having a relationship with the original one. God is our original as he created man in his image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently became a father by myself, and now I understand this matter better.

However, is this representation, of an construct with human-like intelligence, accurate, with regards to the mythology?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose I'm asking two questions in a sense:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is he artificial? (that is, not a member of some ancient natural race of metal giants, for instance)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is he intelligent?  He is presented as having wishes and desires of his own, and at one point this very quality is said to have been the cause of his downfall. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;May we not then say that Talos, though created as a machine or a toy, had all the essential properties of a man?  He moved of his own volition.  He spoke and could be spoken to, had wishes and desires.  Indeed in the tale of the Argonauts, that was the cause of his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; Attributed in game to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratonofstageira.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;&quot;Straton of Stageira&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, who is fictional.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What does that refer to?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2015-06-23T04:47:15.010" LastActivityDate="2015-06-24T07:02:18.803" Title="Was Talos an intelligent machine?"

In it, Talos was an automaton, a self operating machine. He was forged by Hephaistos and was tasked by Zeus to guard Europa's hideout in mount Dikti (in Crete): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And Talos, the man of bronze, as he broke off rocks from the hard cliff, stayed them from fastening hawsers to the shore, when they came to the roadstead of Dicte's haven. He was of the stock of bronze, of the men sprung from ash-trees, the last left among the sons of the gods; and the son of Cronos gave him to Europa to be the warder of Crete and to stride round the island thrice a day with his feet of bronze. Now in all the rest of his body and limbs was he fashioned of bronze and invulnerable; but beneath the sinew by his ankle was a blood-red vein; and this, with its issues of life and death, was covered by a thin skin. So the heroes, though outworn with toil, quickly backed their ship from the land in sore dismay. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Argonautica, by Apollonius Rhodius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus' version differs a bit; Talos is tasked by king Minos to patrol Crete, and he might be shaped like a bull: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Putting to sea from there, they were hindered from touching at Crete by Talos. Some say that he was a man of the Brazen Race, others that he was given to Minos by Hephaestus; he was a brazen man, but some say that he was a bull. He had a single vein extending from his neck to his ankles, and a bronze nail was rammed home at the end of the vein. This Talos kept guard, running round the island thrice every day; wherefore, when he saw the Argo standing inshore, he pelted it as usual with stones. His death was brought about by the wiles of Medea, whether, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died. But some say that Poeas shot him dead in the ankle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Book 1, Apollodorus, Library, Sir James George Frazer, Ed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of these differences Talos doesn't appear to be intelligent in either version.

Kramer, however, did give credence to it, as mentioned by the blogger to whom you linked (see Kramer's &lt;em&gt;History Begins at Sumer,&lt;/em&gt; pp. 143-44). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, the god Enki out of curiosity eats 8 plants in the paradise of Dilmun (cf. Eve eating the forbidden fruit), which the goddess Ninhursag considers a mortal sin, so she causes 8 of Enki's body parts (including his rib) to suffer, and he is on the brink of death. Enlil takes up Enki's cause and persuades Ninhursag to relent, and so various deities then come to heal each of Enki's body parts. The one who heals his rib is the goddess Ninti, whose name means both &quot;lady of the rib,&quot; and &quot;lady who makes live,&quot; which serves as a pun. Thus is established a possible parallel between Ninti and Eve, who was created from Adam's rib (in Hebrew &lt;em&gt;tesla&lt;/em&gt;) and whose name in Hebrew (&lt;em&gt;hawwa&lt;/em&gt;) connotes life (thus Eve was called &quot;the mother of all the living&quot; in Genesis 3:20). The pun doesn't work in Hebrew since the words for rib and life differ, but I'm not sure the biblical writer knew about it or, if he did, cared. (Having said that, it looks like the biblical writer made his own pun, because the Hebrew word for rib, &lt;em&gt;tsela,&lt;/em&gt; can also connote &quot;stumbling,&quot; so although Eve was ostensibly created to be Adam's helper (Gen. 2:18), she proved to be his stumbling block.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are obvious parallels here, which have gotten many people excited, but proving a direct influence has proved elusive, and I know of no biblical scholars (whether faith-based or secular) who maintain that there is any such direct influence, because the usual scholarly criteria for proving intertextual influence are not strongly met here; but this remains a reasonable possibility. More generally, many prevalent ancient Near Eastern mythological motifs do show up in the Hebrew Bible, so it is clear to me that biblical Palestine shared a common cultural (including mythological) context with the broader ancient Near East.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="467" LastEditorUserId="57" LastEditDate="2016-02-01T12:47:42.383" LastActivityDate="2016-02-01T12:47:42.383" CommentCount="0" />

Already in the earliest text mentioning him, Dionysus is a god of two natures, &quot;joy and sorrow&quot; as Hesiod (or Pseudo-Hesiod) in the &lt;em&gt;Catalogue of Women&lt;/em&gt; fr. 179 Most (= fr. 87 Evelyn-White, for those with the older Loeb or are looking online) puts it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;...Dionysus gave to Mmen as a delight and as a burden&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Whoever drinks his fill, the wine becomes maddening for him,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  it binds together his feet and his hands and his tongue and his mind&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  with invisible bonds, and soft sleep loves him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Trans. Glenn Most, Loeb Classical Library)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clearly Dionysus embodies the very nature of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the power which comes from over-intoxication, there were also his attendants, the Maenads (also called the Bacchae or Bacchantes). These women roamed the countryside in drunken, mad revelry. In their frenzy, though, they were also known to kill because of the altered state that received from Dionysus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two of the most famous of this event were the killing of Orpheus and the killing of Pentheus. Orpheus, the eminent musician of the ancient Greek world, who with his lyre charmed Hades himself into giving him back his wife, in grief after losing his wife again (he was instructed not to turn back to look at her before they left the cave, and yet when he neared the end he could not help himself), was torn apart by Maenads in Thrace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The death of Pentheus is recounted in Euripides' &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0092&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bacchae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There Pentheus the king of Thebes refused the worship of Dionysus, so the god made local women crazy, including Pentheus' own mother, and they tore him to pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ancients made it clear the god himself was part of this hallucinogenic enterprise:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;While busily engaged, with sudden beat&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  they hear resounding tambourines; and pipes&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  and crooked horns and tinkling brass renew,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  unseen, the note; saffron and myrrh dissolve&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  in dulcet odours; and, beyond belief,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  the woven webs, dependent on the loom,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  take tints of green, put forth new ivy leaves,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  or change to grape-vines verdant.

Nevertheless, despite Ishtar's recognition, Inanna precedes her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the central myths of &lt;strong&gt;Inanna&lt;/strong&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;Descent of Inanna&lt;/em&gt;. Here Inanna comes to visit her sister Ereshkigal in the Underworld, when her sister has her stripped of her garments (symbolic of her power) and tries to force her to remain there. Inanna was able to escape by offering a substitute, and she ended up choosing her lover (husband?) Dumuzi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be also noted that she utterly leveled Ebih, a mountain which refused to worship her. Yet clearly she's also a sexual goddess. The historical Shulgi, king of Ur, uses terms like &quot;my consort&quot; and &quot;your beloved husband&quot; in describing his relationship with the goddess. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This and other hymns lead some scholars to see her as a powerful goddess, whose personality could be highly erotic but simultaneously utterly destructive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Semitic people of southern Iraq borrowed these myths of Inanna for their goddess &lt;strong&gt;Ishtar&lt;/strong&gt;, whom they equated. Not much more can be said about Ishtar and Tammuz (the Akkadian version of Dumuzi) that Gilgamesh, in his famous epic, hadn't already:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Woe to him whom Ishtar had honoured! The fickle goddess treated her passing lovers cruelly, and the unhappy wretches usually paid dearly for the favours heaped on them. Animals, enslaved by love, lost their native vigour: they fell into traps laid by men or were domesticated by them. 'Thou has loved the lion, mighty in strength', says the hero Gilgamesh to Ishtar, 'and thou hast dug for him seven and seven pits! Thou hast loved the steed, proud in battle, and destined him for the halter, the goad and the whip.'&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Listen to me while I tell the tale of your lovers. There was Tammuz, the lover of your youth, for him you decreed wailing, year after year. You loved the many-coloured Lilac-breasted Roller, but still you struck and broke his wing [...] You have loved the lion tremendous in strength: seven pits you dug for him, and seven. You have loved the stallion magnificent in battle, and for him you decreed the whip and spur and a thong [...] You have loved the shepherd of the flock; he made meal-cake for you day after day, he killed kids for your sake. You struck and turned him into a wolf; now his own herd-boys chase him away, his own hounds worry his flanks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic of Gilgamesh&lt;/em&gt; Tablet 6, trans. by Sandars 1972&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reference and further reading:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gwendolyn Leick 1994. &lt;em&gt;Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature&lt;/em&gt;.

I pay the due penalty&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  In blood! Ah! Let the parts that harmed me, perish!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Let them perish!” cutting away the burden of his groin,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  And suddenly bereft of every mark of manhood.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  His madness set a precedent, and his unmanly servants&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Toss their hair, and cut off their members as if worthless.’&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ovid, &lt;em&gt;Fasti&lt;/em&gt; 4.221-242 (trans. Kline 2004)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, several ancient authors (e.g. Apollodorus 3.5) state that Cybele taught to Dionysus the &lt;em&gt;orgia&lt;/em&gt;, the ecstatic and frenzied form of worship in their respective cults. Orpheus, said to have been killed by Bacchantes, as aforementioned the ecstatic and frenzied worshipers of Dionysus, also had orgiastic mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last of the goddesses I'll mention is &lt;strong&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/strong&gt;. The infamous goddess of love is called Venus by the Romans, there is thus a connection to Inanna/Ishtar, who were said to have been represented by the planet Venus (as too was Aphrodite and Venus).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like alcohol, love can be good or bad, and it shows with her. Befitting the goddess of love, she was also said to be the most beautiful goddess. She was married to Hephaestus (= Vulcan), a lame and disfigured god but an excellent craftsman, and already in Homer she is caught by him having an affair with the more handsome Ares (= Mars).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her destructive power was manifest in different ways. First, as the most beautiful goddess, she won the &quot;beauty contest&quot; (caused by a golden apple thrown at a party on Olympus on which was inscribed &quot;to the most beautiful&quot;) with the Trojan prince Paris (also called Alexander, not at all to be confused with Alexander the Great) judging her, Hera (= Juno, Queen of the Gods, goddess of childbirth), and Athena (= Minvera, a goddess of wisdom, craft, and skill)—the event is now aptly named The Judgment of Paris). Most will know how this story ends: Paris receives as a bribery gift the hand of Helen of Sparta, wife to Menelaus, who thereupon with his brother Agamemnon and &quot;all the Achaeans, Danaans, and Argives&quot; attack Troy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ever since then, &quot;love and war&quot; was a major theme throughout all of Greek and Roman literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a connection with Inanna/Ishtar, too. First, Aphrodite used to be connected to war more intimately than merely the cause of the Trojan War. Some early depictions of Aphrodite have her suited up for battle. There's also the story inside the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; in which Aphrodite fights, is wounded by Diomedes, and cries to her mother, the goddess Dione, after which Zeus then chastises her for being out of place in war:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This only drew a smile from the Father of men and gods. Calling golden Aphrodite to his side, he said: &quot;War is not for you, my child, tend to the loving deeds of wedlock, and leave the fighting to Ares the swift and to Athene.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Homer, &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; 428-430, trans. Kline 2009&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The whole scene is a close parallel to Ishtar who, after Gilgamesh insulted her (referencing Tammuz/Dumizi), flies up to her father Anu, and asks him to release Gugalanna the mighty Bull of Heaven to punish Gilgamesh, though it was then slain by Gilgamesh's companion Enkidu, who himself died because of it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Homer therefore is likely to be combating the existent idea of Aphrodite as a goddess of &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; love and war. Even if he was fairly successful, her destructive powers were still seen. I always found this vase to be a nice representation of this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Gallery/K9.1.html&quot;&gt;http://www.theoi.com/Gallery/K9.1.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To further this connection, Aphrodite also had a lover, whose name was &lt;strong&gt;Adonis&lt;/strong&gt;, most certainly connected to the Semitic word &lt;em&gt;adon&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &quot;lord&quot; (whence Hebrew &lt;em&gt;adonai&lt;/em&gt; meaning &quot;My Lord&quot;). Pseudo-Apollodorus has the best summary (shorter than Ovid's, whose is the best story, but not a summary):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of Aphrodite's wrath&lt;/strong&gt; (for she did not honour Aphrodite), Smyrna developed a lust for her father, and with the help of her nurse slept with him for twelve nights without his knowing it. When he found out he drew his sword and started after her, and as he was about to overtake her, she prayed to the gods to become invisible. The gods took pity on her and changed her into the tree called the Smyrna. Nine months later the tree split open and the baby named Adonis was born. Because of his beauty, Aphrodite secreted him away in a chest, keeping it from the gods, and left him with Persephone. But when Persephone got a glimpse of Adonis, she refused to return him. When the matter was brought to Zeus for arbitration, he divided the year into three parts and decreed that Adonis would spent one third of the year by himself, one third with Persephone, and the rest with Aphrodite. But Adonis added his own portion to Aphrodite’s. Later on, while hunting, he was attacked by a boar and died.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apollodorus &lt;em&gt;Bibliotecha&lt;/em&gt; 3.18 trans. Aldrich 1921&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I highlighted above a nice phrase summarizing this response!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also concerns of the Underworld, similar to Inanna and Dumuzi:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;On his death Adonis was obliged to descend into the lower world, but he was allowed to spend six months out of every year with his beloved Aphrodite in the upper world.

While the word &quot;el&quot; is a generic word for a god, it is also the proper name for the head of the Canaanite pantheon, El. His origins are most directly from the Amorite god Amurru, but going further back he shared traits with Anue (An) and Ea (Enki). In Ugarit he was viewed as the creator god and, with his wife Asherah, fathered the other Canaanite gods and goddesses that we see, for example, in the Ugaritic myths including the Keret myth that you mention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer to your question whether this is the same god as El in the Bible gets more complicated. The Canaanite El was originally the chief god in Palestine, where Israel later emerged. Yahweh, as the Bible itself attests several times (Deut. 33:2-3; Judg. 5:4-5; Hab. 3:3, 7; Ps. 68:8-9; Zech. 9:14), was originally from Seir (or Teman) in the Midian, which spans the east and west sides of the Araba valley in Sinai. Once Yahweh arrived in Palestine from migrants from the Midian (which echoes the stories in Exodus and Numbers), he had to compete for supremacy with the native Canaanite gods. Over time, El was merged into Yahweh, the survivor. Since this merger took place only over time, that's why we see so many references in the Hebrew Bible where Yahweh and El are intended as the same, or more accurately are retroactively explained as being the same. The issue is also confused because the different authors of the Hebrew Bible presenting different positions on this question. Thus, according to one version, the Hebrew god is announced as Yahweh (being the same as the god of Abraham which was El) to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:15, by the Elohist author), which implies that Yahweh was not previously known to the Hebrews. But another author (known as the Yahwist, or J) calls God Yahweh even in the Eden story, and in Genesis 4:26 says that God was known as Yahweh almost from the beginning of humankind. This difference may reflect a situation where the traditional El remained strong in the northern kingdom of Israel, whereas the upstart god Yahweh was being promoted in Judah.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For further reference, this process of merger is discussed well in Mark Smith's book entitled The Early History of God.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a side note, El's wife Asherah was inherited by Yahweh as a result of their merger.

The plot of the famous Irish story may be reconstructed as follows...  Now the Welsh tale is remarkable in that it preserves practically every essential feature of this outline in the right order, but every feature has been recast several times, and all the original cohesion and rationale has been lost.  Math is at pains to preserve the virginity of a damsel, but no reason is offered and the damsel is not his daughter.  The damsel is ravished by stratagem, but nothing is said of her son.  Instead, the woman who takes her place gives birth to a son, Dylan, and he promptly goes to the sea and, instead of drowning, swims like a fish.  But it is not he who becomes the hero of the story but one who develops from the caul or placenta which Dylan's mother lets fall at the time of his birth.  This caul develops into a second child, and upon him are sworn successively the three geasa that were sworn upon Lug: but it is his mother who swears them, and she obviously has no motive.  The way in which she is induced to name him Lleu Llaw Gyffes is obviously reminiscent of the way in which Balor was induced to name his grandson Lug Lamfada.  &lt;strong&gt;Finally, it is not Lleu's grandfather who is slain by a special spear, but Lleu's rival, Gronwy&lt;/strong&gt;.  Except that the order remains intact, the elements could hardly have been juggled more drastically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A common feature in these types of stories is that the father-figure is very difficult to kill, and can only be killed in strange and esoteric ways. Here's an example from Culhwch and Olwen, a story from the same tradition as Math. (The story of Balor and Lug, upon which Math is based upon, also includes a father figure who is hard to kill).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And the third day they returned to the palace. And Yspaddaden Penkawr said to them, &quot;Shoot not at me again unless you desire death. Where are my attendants? Lift up the forks of my eyebrows which have fallen over my eyeballs, that I may see the fashion of my son-in-law.&quot; Then they arose, and, as they did so, Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third poisoned dart and cast it at them. And Kilhwch caught it and threw it vigorously, and wounded him through the eyeball, so that the dart came out at the back of his head. &quot;A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly! As long as I remain alive, my eyesight will be the worse. Whenever I go against the wind, my eyes will water; and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall have a giddiness every new moon. Cursed be the fire in which it was forged. Like the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.&quot; And they went to meat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since Lleu takes the role of the father figure in this rearranged story, it also makes sense that he is hard to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;An attempted explanation of the symbolism behind Lleu's position:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The easiest answer is that the position is the answer to the riddle: he can't be killed &quot;inside or outside,&quot; so he straddles both worlds and becomes vulnerable. However, this doesn't explain why he needs to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've done quite a bit of research into the symbolism of Lleu's death, and having read several sources and talked to a few experts, I'm forced to conclude that no agreed upon explanation exists. However, I have seen a few theories, which I outline below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important to know that Lleu seems to be associated with the sun. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=1l1yXq4xGHsC&amp;amp;pg=PA153&amp;amp;lpg=PA153&amp;amp;dq=lleu+llaw+gyffes+eagle+symbolism&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=JFo9N9d_Hh&amp;amp;sig=ejmr1zvfmO7oQcar6g4KWDbQjcQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=_xmKVcmTGsn2ggSS9IGADA&amp;amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=lleu%20llaw%20gyffes%20eagle%20symbolism&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Queen of the Night: Rediscovering the Celtic Moon Goddess&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the Mabinogi, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Bright One of the Skillful Hand) is transformed into an eagle, residing for a period of time in the top of an oak tree. The eagle and the oak are symbols of a solar or celestial deity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found an article that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mabinogionastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/04/thedeath-of-lleu-llaw-gyffes-here-is.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;claims that the position that Lleu can be killed corresponds to something related to astronomy&lt;/a&gt; (the hut to the sky, the tub/well to the milky way, the goat represents Capella, and Lleu to the constellation Perseus [Perseus seems to have a foot in the milkyway]). The article seems legit, and is definitely worth considering, but I worry that it doesn't seem to be verified by any academics. Here's a picture of the constellation Perseus (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://astropixels.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AstroPixels.com&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://astropixels.com/constellations/charts/images/Per_map.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The constellation Perseus&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another explanation (found in an article about Shakespeare!) ties the age of the spear to the creation of a new year (and perhaps to rebirth):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Blodeuwedd and her lover planned to slay her husband, the Welsh hero Lleu Llaw Gyffes; but he could only be killed by a spear forged &quot;in a year of Sundays&quot;; and so Lleu was struck down exactly one year after the plan was conceived. The death of the year equated the death of the husband; either event signals or is signaled by the Queen's or Lady's attachment to another man.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Aguirre, Manuel. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/518100&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Life, Crown, and Queen: Gertrude and the Theme of Sovereignty&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And as a bonus, here's an article that elaborates on the connection between names, transformations, and the difference between Lleu's and Blodeuwedd's metamorphoses:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The metamorphoses of Lleu and Blodeu(w)edd confirm the theory that, in the Fourth Branch, names function to secure both body and identity. The scene in which Lleu spontaneously transforms into an eagle and the earlier scene in which he is named are linked in such a way that his name emerges as a crucial guarantee of human embodiment; by contrast, Blodeu(w)edd is renamed so that her metamorphosis can never be undone.  Having persuaded her husband, Lleu, to reveal how he may be killed, Blodeu(w)edd has Gronw ambush Lleu while he is demonstrating to his wife exactly the point at which he is at his most vulnerable. Gronw’s ambush prompts Lleu’s transformation: “Then Gronw rose up from the hill that is called Brynn Cyfergyr, and he got up on the end of one knee, and cast the poison-spear, and hit [Lleu] in the side, so that the spear shaft leapt from him and the head stayed in him. And then he went flying up in the shape of an eagle, and gave a terrible cry” (Williams 1951, 88). Although the text gives more details about the spear thrust than the metamorphosis, Lleu’s transformation clearly results from the entry of the spearhead into his body. This passage mirrors the episode in which the young Lleu is named. In this scene, disguised, Gwydion brings the boy to visit Aranrhod; when Aranrhod sees the boy hit a wren with surprising precision and comments on his dexterity, saying, “it is with a skilful hand Lleu can be killed only by a single blow from a spear made only during Sunday mass over the course of one year, and he must be neither inside nor outside, neither on horseback nor on foot; the inventive solution to this riddle involves Lleu’s standing with one foot on the edge of a roofed outdoor bathtub, the other on the back of a goat. The actions in both scenes are also described by identical verbs, bwrw (to throw, cast) and medru (to strike). Sheehan that the fair one hit it [ Ys llaw gyffes y medrwys y lleu ef ]” (Williams 1951, 80), Gwydion manipulates her comment to provide a name for his nephew, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Fair-haired One of the Skilful Hand). Lleu’s name is also the key to his metamorphosis’s reversal. When Gwydion finds the eagle perched in a treetop, he sings three englynion , each time naming Lleu, until the eagle descends from the tree and alights on Gwydion’s knee; Gwydion is then able to strike him with the hutlath “so that he was in his own shape [ rith ]” (Williams 1951, 90). Lleu’s metamorphosis is consistent with those examined above, in that the narrator does not refer to Lleu by name until he is again in his own, human body. Lleu cannot regain his body until he regains his name: it is Gwydion’s ritualized poetic naming of his nephew together with a tap of the hutlath that restores Lleu to human form. Gronw’s skillful striking of Lleu causes Lleu to lose both name and form by reversing the subject positions (active/passive, striker/struck) of the scenario whereby he gained his name&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Sheehan, Sarah, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/591089&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Matrilineal Subjects: Ambiguity, Bodies, and Metamorphosis in the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastEditorUserId="62" LastEditDate="2015-07-12T01:41:42.393" LastActivityDate="2015-07-12T01:41:42.393" CommentCount="1" />

One interesting quote was&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The presence of dragons within Chinese culture dates back several thousands of years with the discovery of a dragon statue dating back to the fifth millennium BC from the Yangshao culture in Henan in 1987, and jade badges of rank in coiled form have been excavated from the Hongshan culture circa 4700-2900 BC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That would seem like a likely candidate. Unfortunately, the in-text citations do not work, I can find no other mention of either of these that does not quote Wikipedia verbatim, and this probably doesn't count as mythology, either. Neither are associated with &quot;myths&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theallineed.com/entertainment/08033180.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; blog post/whatever-it-is. Either way, it was helpful insofar as it led me somewhere. Citing &lt;em&gt;Sumerian Mythology&lt;/em&gt;, 1944, 1961, by; Samuel Noah Kramer, it states&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;KUR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sumeria 3rd Millennium B.C.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Since the dragon-slaying theme was an important motif in the Sumerian mythology of the third millennium B. C., it is not unreasonable to assume that many a thread in the texture of the Greek and early Christian dragon tales winds back to Sumerian sources.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We find mention of Kur in three myths from the 4th - 3rd Millennium B.C., (more than a millennium before Tiamat!), In the introductory prologue to the epic tale &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Nether World,&quot;( written on eight tablets - seven excavated in Nippur and one in Ur), Where Enki, the water-god, fights Kur after he learns that The goddess Ereshkigal was carried off violently into the nether world, by Kur. Enki fought Kur from a boat, and Kur fought back savagely with stones of all sizes, and attacked Enki's boat with the primeval waters which it controlled. Unfortunately for us, the author of this tale is so anxious to proceed with the Gilgamesh tale that he doesn't finish the dragon part, and leaves us hanging. It is certain that Enki wins though because he is in the rest of the poem, Kur is not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The second version of the slaying-of-the-dragon myth can be found in &quot;The Feats and Exploits of Ninurta.&quot; (49 tablets) A significant version, due to the fact that it is evident that it was utilized by the Semitic redactors in the creation of the Babylonian Creation Myth featuring Tiamat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In this version, Ninurta, the warrior-god, is the hero of the story. His personified weapon, Sharur, kisses up to him in a drawn out speech extolling the heroic qualities and deeds of Ninurta to convince him to go after Kur, and attach and destroy him. What Sharur has against Kur is not written in the text that is available. Ninurta leaves to do as asked, but finds himself lacking and &quot;flees like a bird&quot;. Sharur though, won't let it go and speaks, reassuring and encouraging Ninurta with his words. &quot;Ninurta now attacks Kur fiercely with all the weapons at his command, and Kur is completely destroyed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The third version of the slaying-of-the-dragon myth can be found in &quot;Inanna and Ebih.&quot; A one hundred and ninety line poem. (12 tablets)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The dragon-slayer in this version of the story is a goddess, Inanna, curiously known as both the goddess of love and also as the goddess of battle and strife, (She must have been married), and is also referred to in many Sumerian hymns as &quot;The Destroyer of Kur.&quot; Kur, is also referred to as The 'mountain,' in the Poem. Did I mention that Kur was also the first fire breathing dragon?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interesting. I decided to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, the relevant part of &lt;em&gt;Sumerian Mythology&lt;/em&gt; appears to be available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. No part of it quotes any relevant sections of the myths that imply or outright state that Kur is a dragon. So I decided to find them for myself. (By the way, related notes on many Sumerian myths, including these, can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianlawton.com/mes4.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://templeofsumer.org/myth14.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Nether World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The relevant passage appears to be&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;1 It began in the early days of the world, after the earth and the heavens had been separated. It was a turbulent time. Ereshkigal had been taken by the dragon Kur and Enki was sailing after to put things into the order that they belonged in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;2 The waters that Enki sailed were being pummeled by rocks. The smallest of these hit the side of Enki's boat like they were like hammers. The largest of these hit with the impact of a boulder thrown from a catapult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is all that remains of the explicit tale of the fight of Kur against Enki.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr162.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Exploits of Ninurta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Asag leapt up at the head of the battle. For a club it uprooted the sky, took it in its hand; like a snake it slid its head along the ground. It was a mad dog attacking to kill the helpless, dripping with sweat on its flanks. Like a wall collapsing, the Asag fell on Ninurta the son of Enlil. Like an accursed storm, it howled in a raucous voice; like a gigantic snake, it roared at the Land. It dried up the waters of the Mountains, dragged away the tamarisks, tore the flesh of the Earth and covered her with painful wounds. It set fire to the reed-beds, bathed the sky in blood, turned it inside out; it dispersed the people there. At that moment, on that day, the fields became black potash, across the whole extent of the horizon, reddish like purple dye -- truly it was so!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Asag&lt;/a&gt; is often considered to be different from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kur&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kur&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackdrago.com/fame/kur.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; (of dubious reputation) states&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are Asag and Kur synonymous, both referencing a dragon? Or are they different entities attributed as the dark force overcome by Ninurta? Owing to the age of Sumerian literature, and its predecessors adapting the myths, this remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr132.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inana and Eibh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;An, the king of the deities, answered her: &quot;My little one demands the destruction of this mountain -- what is she taking on? Inana demands the destruction of this mountain -- what is she taking on? She demands the destruction of this mountain -- what is she taking on?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It has poured fearsome terror on the abodes of the gods. It has spread fear among the holy dwellings of the Anuna deities. It has poured its terror and ferocity over this land. It has poured the mountain range's radiance and fear over all the lands. Its arrogance extends grandly to the centre of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;. . .&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;My lady confronted the mountain range. She advanced step by step. She sharpened both edges of her dagger. She grabbed Ebih's neck as if ripping up esparto grass. She pressed the dagger's teeth into its interior. She roared like thunder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The rocks forming the body of Ebih clattered down its flanks. From its sides and crevices great serpents spat venom. She damned its forests and cursed its trees. She killed its oak trees with drought. She poured fire on its flanks and made its smoke dense. The goddess established authority over the mountain. Holy Inana did as she wished.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Huh. That's disappointing. The literal interpretation states that Inana's foe is a mountain, not a dragon. Indeed, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackdrago.com/fame/kur.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;that earlier dubious source&lt;/a&gt; states,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Another disambiguation should be made between Kur the dragon and the myth of Inanna and Ebih. Inanna was the Sumerian goddess of love, battle, and strife and among her many epithets was the 'destroyer of Kur.' In this myth, Kur is also called 'mountain Ebih,' which is a district northeast of Sumer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, Inanna overcame Kur, but in this myth, Kur is an hostile land, not a dragon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is the myth being metaphorical when it describes Inana's foe as a mountain?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This myth is doubtful, as are, come to think of it, the other two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my (non-expert) opinion, &lt;em&gt;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Nether World&lt;/em&gt; is not strong evidence for a dragon. The source I gave is the only translation I could find that explicitly calls Kur a dragon. Most others do not refer to that. &lt;em&gt;Inana and Eibh&lt;/em&gt; also seems to be a lost cause, because, quite literally, Inana is fighting a mountain, not a dragon. I doubt that the myth is being figurative. Mythology tends to be literal, realistic or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Exploits of Ninurta&lt;/em&gt; seems to be the best evidence available. It says&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;like a snake it slid its head along the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;like a gigantic snake, it roared at the Land.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It set fire to the reed-beds&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Circumstantial? Perhaps. But it seems like a dragon-like creature. I'm calling this one the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now for the date.

I don't think the stories ever specified whether the sacrifice took place in heaven (I personally doubt that detail would have been relevant to the people telling the story), but the Aztecs had highly developed concepts of heaven and hell. If you're interested in learning more, the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0806122951&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features an extensive analysis of that myth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/popol-vuh&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;popol-vuh&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;popol-vuh&lt;/a&gt; includes a story of how two twins die and are resurrected in the land of the dead (i.e. hell, not heaven). I know that you asked for stories concerning heaven, but I'm including this example to show that many myths feature mortals dying and coming back to life in otherworldly settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This third example is really interesting: it's an Inca myth recorded after the conquest. It's called &quot;The boy who rose to the sky&quot;, and it's about a boy who travels to the sky (which might be analogous to heaven?) in search of a girl.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that sky-world, there is a pool that makes old people young, which could be compared to rebirth:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When they arrived in the sky, they were dirty and bearded. They had grown old. But when they came out of the water they were handsome and young.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also clear that this place is inhospitable to mortals:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For a year the young man lives with his wife in this manner. But when the year had passed, she began to neglect him and no longer brought him his food. One day she went out, saying, &quot;The time has come when you must leave. After that she did not come back to the house. She had abandoned him at last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Then the boy's eyes filled with tears and he returned to the edge of the sky lake. When he got there, he saw the condor rising up in the distance. As he ran to meet him, the condor flew to his side, and he saw that the sacred condor had grown old.

Since Herodotus' life was roughly 480s to after 420, I'll round to roughly 450 for his &quot;time&quot;. That gives us 2050 BCE for the god Dionysus (though this would conflict with Euripides!), 1350 for the life of the hero Heracles, and 1250 for the god Pan, which puts the Trojan war roughly around 1300-1275 or so. This is pretty consistent, as Heracles sacked Troy before Agamemnon, and after doing so put child Priam on the throne. Priam, of course, was an old man during the Trojan War (Apollod. 2.6.4, 3.12.3).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the passage Herodotus mentioned above I reproduce below (and can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.43&amp;amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&quot;&gt;2.43&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Concerning Heracles, I heard it said that he was one of the twelve gods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Side note: The Egyptians had different pantheons depending on what city you were in. There were either a set of eight (the Ogdoad of Hermopolis: Nu and Naunet, Amun and Amaunet, Kuk and Kauket, Huh and Hauhet), set of nine (the Ennead of Heliopolis: Atum, his children Shu and Tefnut, their children Geb and Nut and their children Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys), nine plus one (centered in Memphis, based on the Ennead but with Ptah as the head), or a set of twelve, of which I do not think we know very well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But nowhere in Egypt could I hear anything about the other Heracles, whom the Greeks know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another side note, this Heracles is actually the Phoenician god Melqart. See Bonnet below if you know French and have access to a scholarly library, or Google Melqart and you can probably find some good information. Or ask another question here!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But Heracles is a very ancient god in Egypt; as the Egyptians themselves say, the change of the eight gods to the twelve, one of whom they acknowledge Heracles to be, was made seventeen thousand years before the reign of Amasis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amasis here is Ahmose II, who was Pharaoh 570–526 BCE, placing Heracles in Egypt to ca. 2250 (rounding to a nice middle number), which would make it in the middle of the 6th Dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Herodotus, of course, was not the only historian to work out dates for various mythical events, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War#Dates_of_the_Trojan_War&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has a nice list of various Late Classical/Hellenistic scholars' dates for determining when the Trojan War happened:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ephorus gives 1135 BC, Sosibius 1172 BC, Eratosthenes 1184 BC/1183 BC, Timaeus 1193 BC, the Parian marble 1209 BC/1208 BC, Dicaearchus 1212 BC, Herodotus around 1250 BC, Eretes 1291 BC, while Douris 1334 BC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is one further clue about the &quot;origin&quot; of the Greek world, but it is even more imprecise:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Hecataeus the historian was once at Thebes , where he made a genealogy for himself that had him descended from a god in the sixteenth generation. But the priests of Zeus did with him as they also did with me (who had not traced my own lineage). They brought me into the great inner court of the temple and showed me wooden figures there which they counted to the total they had already given, for every high priest sets up a statue of himself there during his lifetime; pointing to these and counting, the priests showed me that each succeeded his father; they went through the whole line of figures, back to the earliest from that of the man who had most recently died. Thus, when Hecataeus had traced his descent and claimed that his sixteenth forefather was a god, the priests too traced a line of descent according to the method of their counting; for they would not be persuaded by him that a man could be descended from a god; they traced descent through the whole line of three hundred and forty-five figures, not connecting it with any ancestral god or hero, but declaring each figure to be a “Piromis” the son of a “Piromis”; in Greek, one who is in all respects a good man.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.143&amp;amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&quot;&gt;Herodotus, &lt;em&gt;Histories&lt;/em&gt; 2.143&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hecataeus was Herodotus' real predecessor. He wrote genealogies of the world, including Greek myths, and it's a shame we do not have it anymore, otherwise we might know a bit better when he thought the world began.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this passage clues is in on two things. One, Hecataeus places humankind sixteen generations back. This is difficult to reckon, because we do not know how many years he was counting as a generation, but by a normal 40 years, it leads us to 1140 (from 500, when Hecataeus was already a grown man, so perhaps even earlier). This is unlikely to be exactly the case, as he must have placed the Trojan War around this time, as Herodotus did. An alternative would be that he merely placed his line back that far, assuming that the gods were still reproducing with mortals, and Herodotus (and this unnamed Egyptian) must just be mistaken in his assumption that that's when the gods were mating &lt;em&gt;in the beginning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other thing it lets us know is that the Greeks could imagine that humans were around 10800–14250 BCE (i.e. 10,350 to 13,800 years before &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; time).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That must have been pretty outrageous to the poets!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bonnet, C. 1988. &lt;em&gt;Melqart.

We can also turn to the iconography, which likewise also does not necessarily portray a shield. See, e.g., the metope from Salinas ca. 540 B.C. (at the Museo Nazionale Archeologico in Palermo, Italy; in Morford &amp;amp; Lenardon's &lt;em&gt;Classical Mythology&lt;/em&gt; 8th ed., p. 552) and the black-figure jug by Amasis, Attic, 6th cen. BCE (in Neumann, &lt;em&gt;Consciousness&lt;/em&gt; (below), illustration 25) both showing Perseus killing her while simply averting his gaze. For the Greeks, averting the gaze and looking at her reflection in the shield/mirror were obviously equivalent. Her power was either nullified or greatly diminished when looked at in reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also don't think the eyes were crucial. I'm not aware of any source that stresses her eyes. Rather, they focus on her whole face (Ovid, &lt;em&gt;Metamorphosis&lt;/em&gt; 4:783) or overall appearance, as in the passage from Apollodoris that you quote. We can't ignore her protruding tongue, tusks, or snakes for hair, since they are all essential to her character and mythological meaning. That's why they are there. And that's why Perseus had to look at the shield even though she was sleeping (presumably her eyes were closed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we go into the underlying psychological aspects of the myth (as we should with most myths), Perseus, like the typical hero, is in the process of fully realizing his ego consciousness, while this monster represents the all-consuming Terrible Mother of the unconscious seeking to suck him back into there and destroy his nascent ego consciousness. To confront her directly is too dangerous, so only averting the gaze or looking at her indirectly through the reflection will enable him to succeed. In the versions where the &quot;bronze&quot; shield/mirror appears, that is a solar/light symbol of the ego that not only enables him to see a diminished Medusa, but which as such also serves as a guide and beacon to him to keep him on course. Here it is also relevant that the Greeks also stressed the details of his escape. When Perseus kills the Medusa, the winged horse Perseus appears out of her (representing the ego that has escaped her, a parallel with Perseus himself), which Perseus rides while being pursued by Medusa's sisters. His winged sandals, invisibility helmet, and hiding-wallet also play a figurative role, for which he has to thank Athena, goddess of wisdom (and so of consciousness).

Acharya S is unscholarly, makes many silly mistakes, and thus is unreliable; and Maher's people obviously got his bullet points from the Acharya piece to which you linked in your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acharya throws up numerous points hoping that some of them will stick, but they don't. She doesn't cite any Egyptian texts that support her view, which is not surprising because there are none and, I would argue, there can be none. This is because the idea that Horus can be crucified and resurrected is logically precluded by Egypt's mythology and religious thinking. While a person is alive (taking the king as the example), he is Horus. But once you die, you become Osiris and are not Horus, so it can only be Osiris who is resurrected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not having any Egyptian texts to rely upon, Acharya relies on images of Horus with his arms out from his sides, and the idea that the Egyptian ankh and Christ's cross are the same. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stellarhousepublishing.com/washoruscrucified.html&quot;&gt;www.stellarhousepublishing.com/washoruscrucified.html&lt;/a&gt; The ankh sign comes not from a cross but from a sandal strap (see Gardiner sign S34). In Egyptian, the ankh glyph is used to mean &quot;life&quot; as well as for the verb &quot;to live,&quot; but it never is an agency of death; in Egypt no one ever dies on an ankh, much less is crucified on one. There are no such images in the iconography, since crucifixion was not practiced in ancient Egypt (at least before Roman times). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, a figure holding out his arms in itself says nothing about death or crucifixion, or a cross or Christ. Acharya's notion reminds me of Tertullian's laughable interpretation of Moses' surveying the Hebrews' (led by Joshua) battle against the Amalekites (Exod.17:8-13), where by standing on a hill and surveying the battle below, Moses (with help from Aaron and Hur) held his hands out to his sides and so caused the Hebrews to prevail. Tertullian claimed that this posture prefigured Christ and the cross, foretelling the cross through which Christ would be victorious over death and bring salvation. (Tertullian, &lt;em&gt;Against Marcion,&lt;/em&gt; Book 3, Ch. 18.) No one would agree with such kinds of interpretations today. Yet Acharya relies on similarly ignorant/silly statements and wishful thinking by Church Fathers to support her claim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past it has sometimes been claimed (e.g., by Wallis Budge, in his &lt;em&gt;Legends of the Gods&lt;/em&gt; (1912), see &lt;a href=&quot;http://sacred-texts.com/egy/leg/leg11.htm&quot;&gt;http://sacred-texts.com/egy/leg/leg11.htm&lt;/a&gt; (among Egyptologists, Budge is no longer considered reliable)) that, in a myth recited on the Metternich Stela now on exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the child Horus is stung by a scorpion (which is Seth's doing), dies from the poison, and is resurrected by Thoth. But I know of no modern reading/translation of this text that has him dying rather than just unconscious and on the brink of death. The Stela's text itself says that &quot;the child was weak beyond answering,&quot; and &quot;refused the jar [of drink],&quot; which obviously means he is not dead. J.F. Borghouts, &lt;em&gt;Ancient Egyptian Texts&lt;/em&gt; (1978), p. 63 (in lines 171-74 if the Stela). The scholarly discussions of the text accord with this interpretation. See Nora Scott, &quot;The Metternich Stela,&quot; The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 9.8:201-17 (1951) (Horus is &quot;unconscious&quot; (p. 213); Scott was Research Fellow in the Egyptian Art Department at the Met); John Nunn, Ancient Egyptian Medicine, p. 110 (1996) (Horus is &quot;unconscious&quot;); Robert Ritner, &lt;em&gt;The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice,&lt;/em&gt; p. 57 n. 266 (1993) (Horus is &quot;injured&quot;);  Geraldine Pinch, &lt;em&gt;Magic in Ancient Egypt,&lt;/em&gt; pp. 144-45 (1994) (Horus is &quot;too weak and ill to suckle&quot; and has a &quot;sickness&quot;); Emily Teeter, &lt;em&gt;Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt,&lt;/em&gt; p. 175 (2011) (Horus was was &quot;cured&quot; by Thoth, which does not seem like a raising from the dead). This interpretation makes sense in terms of the magical spells recited that invoked this myth to cure victims of snakebite, scorpion stings, etc., who are &lt;em&gt;still alive;&lt;/em&gt; they are not being brought back from the dead. For this purpose, the recovery of Horus was being used as a parallel example, so it made sense that he too was only on the brink of death. It is like the Billy Crystal scene in &lt;em&gt;The Princess Bride,&lt;/em&gt; where his character Miracle Max observes that Wesley is &quot;only mostly dead,&quot; and then proceeds to bring him back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to put it bluntly, the idea is a load of Horuss**t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="467" LastEditorUserId="467" LastEditDate="2015-07-23T20:57:23.727" LastActivityDate="2015-07-23T20:57:23.727" CommentCount="5" />

The Metternich Stele relates the story of Horus dying by the sting of a scorpion.

The news of this event was conveyed to her by the gods, who cried out to her to come to see her son Horus, whom the terrible scorpion Uhat had killed. Isis, stabbed with pain at the news, as if a knife had been driven into her body, ran out distraught with grief. It seems that she had gone to perform a religious ceremony in honour of Osiris in a temple near Hetep-hemt, leaving her child carefully concealed in Sekhet-An. During her absence the scorpion Uhat, which had been sent by Set, forced its way into the biding-place of Horus, and there stung him to death. When Isis came and found the dead body, she burst forth in lamentations, the sound of which brought all the people from the neighbouring districts to her side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A little bit later: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Then he came to Isis and told her that no harm could possibly have happened to Horus, for he was under the protection of the Boat of Ra; but his words failed to comfort Isis, and though she acknowledged the greatness of his designs, she complained that they savoured of delay. &quot;What is the good,&quot; she asks, &quot;of all thy spells, and incantations, and magical formulae, and the great command of maa-kheru, if Horus is to perish by the poison of a scorpion, and to lie here in the arms of Death? Evil, evil is his destiny, for it hath entailed the deepest misery for him and death.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In answer to these words Thoth, turning to Isis and Nephthys, bade them to fear not, and to have no anxiety about Horus, &quot;For,&quot; said he, &quot;I have come from heaven to heal the child for his mother.&quot; He then pointed out that Horus was under protection as the Dweller in his Disk (Aten), the Great Dwarf, the Mighty Ram, the Great Hawk, the Holy Beetle, the Hidden Body, the Divine Bennu, etc., and proceeded to utter the great spell which restored Horus to life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of Horus as a prefiguration of Jesus Christ is a clear-cut case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0CCUQFjAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sbl-site.org%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Fpresidentialaddresses%2FJBL81_1_1Sandmel1961.pdf&amp;amp;ei=OiuSVZSpM4na-QGc36uYDA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGryVzi_dnulla8QCrdTwahuEXf1w&amp;amp;sig2=2PNWTsY81EwboxzU4iN62A&amp;amp;bvm=bv.96783405,d.cWw&quot;&gt;parallelomania&lt;/a&gt; (warning: PDF).

Because the point of the &lt;em&gt;Works and Days&lt;/em&gt; is different from Theogony, in that he wants to promote the labor of men and hard work, he invents another Strife to use for didactic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the real inconsistency lies further in.

After Prometheus stole fire from Olympus and gave it to men, Zeus, angry that men might not now work as hard, devised a plan to give them woman. He made the first woman, Pandora, gave her intense curiosity, and then gave her to Epimetheus, the brother of Prometheus. He then gave Epimetheus a box (nowadays called a jar) filled with various evils. Her curiosity got the better of her, and she opening the box let out all the evils to plague mankind, making it worse than before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, he thinks that maybe his story didn't quite get across:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So is there no way to escape the will of Zeus.

There is no Pandora, there is no Promethean fire, and that doesn't seem to bother him much. Perhaps these might be closer to parables, but Greek writers believed in them in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later authors, especially late ones, tended to accept some and expect variation among reports. &lt;a href=&quot;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html&quot;&gt;Diodorus Siculus&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of this one. When discussing the famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/627/are-there-any-ancient-myths-about-adventuring-parties/940#940&quot;&gt;Calydonian Boar hunt&lt;/a&gt;, he first gives a brief overview of the accepted &quot;facts&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The facts are these: Once when Oeneus had an excellent crop of grain, he offered sacrifices to the other gods, but neglected Artemis alone; and angered at him for this the goddess sent forth against him the famous Calydonian boar, a creature of enormous size. 3 This animal harried the neighbouring land and damaged the farms; whereupon Meleager, the son of Oeneus, being then in the bloom of youth and excelling in strength and in courage, took along with himself many of the bravest men and set out to hunt the beast. Meleager was the first to plunge his javelin into it and by general agreement was accorded the reward of valour, which consisted of the skin of the animal. 4 But Atalantê, the daughter of Schoeneus, participated in the hunt, and since Meleager was enamoured of her, he relinquished in her favour the skin and the praise for the greatest bravery. The sons of Thestius, however, who had also joined in the hunt, were angered at what he had done, since he had honoured a stranger woman above them and set kinship aside. Consequently, setting at naught the award which Meleager had made, they lay in wait for Atalantê, and falling upon her as she returned to Arcadia took from her the skin. 5 Meleager, however, was deeply incensed both because of the love which he bore Atalantê and because of the dishonour shown her, and espoused the cause of Atalantê. And first of all he urged the robbers to return to the woman the meed of valour which he had given her; and when they paid no heed to him he slew them, although they were brothers of Althaea. Consequently Althaea, overcome with anguish at the slaying of the men of her own blood, uttered a curse in which she demanded the death of Meleager; and the immortals, so the account runs, gave heed to her and made an end of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He then &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; follows it up with an account given by &quot;certain writers of myth&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But certain writers of myths give the following account: — At the time of the birth of Meleager the Fates stood over Althaea in her sleep and said to her that her son Meleager would die at the moment when the brand in the fire had been consumed. Consequently, when she had given birth, she believed that the safety of her child depended upon the preservation of the brand and so she guarded the brand with every care. 7 Afterward, however, being deeply incensed at the murder of her brothers, she burned the brand and so made herself the cause of the death of Meleager; but as time went on she grieved more and more over what she had done and finally made an end of her life by hanging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that's just it! It doesn't seem to bother Diodorus at all, and it likely didn't bother very many Greeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, the accounts of Electra in Aeschylus' &lt;em&gt;Oresteia&lt;/em&gt;, Sophocles' &lt;em&gt;Electra&lt;/em&gt;, and both Euripides' &lt;em&gt;Electra&lt;/em&gt; and his &lt;em&gt;Orestes&lt;/em&gt; all differ greatly from each other, depending on what they want to emphasize.

Cook argues that the flaming wheel launched through the air is a mythical expression for the Sun, and that Ixion himself “typifies a whole series of human Ixions who in bygone ages were done to death as effete embodiments of the sungod.”  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is some possible symbolism as the sun wheel is found in several mythologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why this punishment?

The wheel symbolized the wheel (circle) of the seasons, as well as the sun-disk. The sun as a  wheel is an ancient symbol, often depicted in the form of a wheeled chariot being driven across the sky; the swastika is another version of the sun-wheel in motion. In this ritual, the wheel was stuffed with straw or hay (the yellowish color of which resembled the sun) so that the wheel itself was barely visible, and in many cases an axle protruded a meter or so on each side, which people used to guide it down the hill. The idea was for it to roll all the way to the bottom, into the water if any; if it did not roll all the way down, the harvest would be bad&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/1tb0M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;flaming wheel&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the lower amphora image, on the right , there is an extension and it looks as if the &quot;nymph&quot;? is sitting on it, and it does look like the axle in the third picture.

It happened in the neighborhoods of Athens when I was growing up).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A possibility exists that the rolling wheel ending up  in the water was a ritual in the area ,  as described above, and Ixion was tied up to the wheel in the myth on a preexisting symbol  so that he would burn as a punishment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="151" LastEditorUserId="151" LastEditDate="2015-07-03T11:12:16.787" LastActivityDate="2015-07-03T11:12:16.787" CommentCount="2" />

Since Ixion laid with a cloud thinking it was Hera, some, such as Martin Nilsson, have speculated that instead of a sun, he was some figure for making it rain. Nilsson also points out that this cloud was connected with Nephele (which is merely Greek for &quot;cloud&quot;) in the Argonaut story, where she saves Phrixus and Helle by sending them a ram with golden fleece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ixion also must be of extreme antiquity and likely connected to Märchen, as he is completely divorced from any of the major lineages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are parallels for him, though. Besides &quot;the sun&quot; or &quot;rain clouds&quot;, he is one of the major offenders against the order of Zeus' universe, such as Sisyphus, Tantalus, Asclepius, Atlas, Prometheus, and later Iapetus' two other sons Menoetius and Epimetheus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sisyphus might be the closest parallel to Ixion, as one who rolls a rock up the hill and lets it fall back down parallels the rising and fall of the sun, but other interpretations are possible, such as the waves, the tides, the moon even. His sin was to hold death hostage so that no one could die.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tantalus' crime I outlined &lt;a href=&quot;http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/598/was-there-a-significant-transformation-of-the-heracles-mythos-from-homeric-times/970#970&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I do not know what the pool of water below and fruit trees above him mean. It is interesting to note that Pindar thinks his crime was stealing ambrosia (and thus attempting immortality), which parallels not only Sisyphus' crime above, but also Asclepius', who with his medicine could raise the dead. Asclepius wasn't punished in Hades, but outright zapped by lightning (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DP.%3Apoem%3D3&quot;&gt;Pindar, &lt;em&gt;Pythian&lt;/em&gt; 3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their crime however probably reflect Pindar's preoccupation with the hubris of his clientele. After winning fame and glory (kleos is the key word here) in athletic games, they might have developed a big head, and Pindar, suggests Crotty, Kurke, and Nicholson, might have added a tender caution in his praise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Atlas and Prometheus are both tied in some way to mountains (Prometheus literally), with Atlas at the western edge of the world (the Atlas Mountains in Morocco) and Prometheus in the eastern edge (the Caucasus Mountains).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hesiod picked up on this and schematized it, making Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius (though a titan, the name is human, and is shared with Patroclus' father in the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0133%3Abook%3D16%3Acard%3D1&quot;&gt;16.14&lt;/a&gt;), all of which committed some injustice against Zeus which characterizes human condition. Menoetius was full of hubris, and thus Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt. Epimetheus (&quot;afterthought&quot;, based on his brother Prometheus, &quot;forethought&quot;) of course received Pandora, the first woman and the one who unleashed evils on humankind.

In this connection, Kerenyi in his &lt;em&gt;The Gods of the Greeks&lt;/em&gt; (pp. 159-60) penned a conclusory statement, &quot;One can easily recognise in the whole story the punishment of an older, savage sun-god who had to had to be tamed beneath the rule of Zeus.&quot; This might be the case since Zeus was in the business of absorbing other deities and their functions, but Kerenyi points to no sources or other grounds for this conclusion. The article that Anna quotes in her answer above, which relies on Cook's &lt;em&gt;Zeus,&lt;/em&gt; takes the same view. There is indeed significant iconography showing the wheel to be flaming (just search on Google for Ixion images), so this image appears to have been popular. On the other hand, Robert Graves (&lt;em&gt;Greek Myths,&lt;/em&gt; 63.1-2) goes off in another direction showing echoes of Frazer, claiming that Ixion was an oak-king who married a moon-goddess (Dia), and was then slain in a ritual involving him being spread-eagled on a tree, which image later became Ixion on the wheel. He also claims that old kings called themselves Zeus and their marriage to the moon-goddess displeased the later Olympian priests, hence the hubris theme leading to the punishment. Graves also links Ixion's name to vegetation, not anything solar. So no solar motif for Graves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turning to the actual sources, from what I see they don't seem to be stressing a solar theme. Although the &lt;em&gt;Scholiast&lt;/em&gt; on Pindar's Pythians mentions that the wheel was fiery, &lt;em&gt;Pindar himself&lt;/em&gt; (Pythian Ode 2.39-44), as well as Hyginus (&lt;em&gt;Fabulae&lt;/em&gt; 62), Diodorus (&lt;em&gt;Historical Library&lt;/em&gt; 4.69.5), Apollodorus (&lt;em&gt;Library,&lt;/em&gt; Epit. 1.20), Virgil (&lt;em&gt;Georgics&lt;/em&gt; 4.484; &lt;em&gt;Aeneid&lt;/em&gt; 6.601), and Lucian (&lt;em&gt;Dialogues of the Gods&lt;/em&gt; VI) never mention fire; they just mention the wheel spinning/whirling, not necessarily going across the sky (although that could be the case), and that the wheel turns due to the force of the winds (not its own power, as sun-gods do). To my mind, this, plus the fact that some later sources (Hyginus; Virgil, &lt;em&gt;Aeneid&lt;/em&gt;; Lucian) felt comfortable placing the wheel in Hades rather than in the sky, suggests that a solar symbolism of the wheel is not the main point here, at least as the story appears in these later versions which differ from the presumed versions that Kerenyi and Cook were talking about. Thus, Kerenyi and Cook could be right in the sense that we may just be seeing later versions that mask the original, apples vs. oranges to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on what we do have for sources, for these authors the wheel and its spinning appear to symbolize primarily the passage of time into eternity, showing that Ixion's punishment is for eternity. Most of the sources (Pindar, Diodorus, Hyginus, and Lucian) stress that the wheel is supposed to turn for eternity. This has a rough parallel in the punishment of Prometheus for his act of hubris, which likewise was supposed to be eternal. Finally, Pindar mentions that the wheel has 4 spokes, which normally symbolizes dividing the passage of time into measures (seasons), which are endless cycles. That is, the hub, which appears not to move, represents eternity, while the outer part with the spokes moving represents time passing. See, e.g., &lt;em&gt;The Book of Symbols,&lt;/em&gt; A. Ronnberg, ed., p. 504.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think the wheel here has anything to do with the earthly punishment of being broken on the wheel. In that punishment, the victim dies within 1-3 days, whereas Ixion's punishment is eternal and none of the accounts has him dying. None of the accounts has him being broken or otherwise physically abused while on the wheel; except, of course, for the eternal flames in any versions of the story which have fire on the wheel, but that is very different from being broken on the wheel. Finally, based on my prior research, I don't recall this form of punishment being used in the ancient world. (I didn't research this point here since it was not mentioned in your original question, and was raised only in another answer above.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="467" LastEditorUserId="467" LastEditDate="2015-07-05T01:34:11.860" LastActivityDate="2015-07-05T01:34:11.860" CommentCount="1" />

I won't duplicate here what I said in my post (since it is &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; relevant here and would all have to be repeated here), so will simply &quot;incorporate&quot; that here for background as part of this answer, so that I can focus here on the narrow question asked, i.e., whether Liberty and Columbia are the same goddess. Now I get to include some things that I had researched but did not have room for in my blog post!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But first regarding the threshold issue of whether we are dealing with myth here: If we were merely dealing with Columbia Pictures and its symbol, then I can see why there would not be real myth. But there is a long historical background to this showing that we are dealing with the evolution of classical Greek and Roman goddesses (Eleutheria and Libertas respectively). In the American Colonies and in the later USA, this goddess (Liberty and Columbia) became part of our own mythology of our struggle for independence, and later of our country. And while they were not worshipped as goddesses, they were revered, sacred figures that made us feel that our country is larger than life.  Finally, our division of this goddess into two separate but related figures is instructive as a wonderful illustration of how in the ancient world too the same deities had different aspects and epithets reflecting the various functions they served (think of the Triple Goddess, or the various faces of Aphrodite as Ourania, Pandemos, and many other titles). It also helps us appreciate the phenomenon of syncretism of deities in the ancient world, since Columbia did get swallowed up by Liberty, in the form of the Statue of Liberty, by the 1920s. This question offers us a wonderful exercise in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turning to the evidence for the narrower question at hand. As mentioned in my post, the goddess Liberty did emerge as a symbol for American freedom from the British Crown in the pre-revolutionary war years, but by the time of the revolutionary war itself both Liberty and Columbia (from Christopher Columbus) were names for this same goddess. This can be seen most simply and easily by comparing coins struck during that time. Below is a coin struck in Boston in 1776 by Paul Revere himself, depicting &quot;Goddess Liberty&quot; sitting on a globe with her trademark cap, holding her trademark rod in one hand and the scales of justice in the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/dzBPC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paul Revere&amp;#39;s coin, 1776&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, right after the war, in Connecticut and New York essentially the same image was minted (except the cap is on the rod, also a traditional image of Libertas), only now her title was Immunis Columbia (i.e, &quot;Immune Columbia,&quot; since we had won the war) (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/4TDZx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as the two originally identical figures evolved they came to represent &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; aspects of the goddess and feature differing traits. Liberty was a &quot;higher&quot; figure representing not so directly America itself (not wearing the stars and stripes) but more particularly America's highest ideals of liberty and freedom. Columbia, on the other hand, represented America itself more than just its ideals, was usually dressed in the stars and stripes, and was invoked for popular patriotic and political purposes (see image below). Her name was also used in a variety of titles, including the District of Columbia, Columbia University, and yes Columbia Pictures, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/J0ap5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image of Columbia from during World War I&quot;&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So right here in America we see the same kind of syncretism and multiple aspects/epithets of the same goddess that we saw in ancient classical mythology. The mere fact that we can find this confusing, as evidenced by this question itself, is part of the proof of that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="467" LastEditorUserId="467" LastEditDate="2015-07-06T05:11:23.697" LastActivityDate="2015-07-06T05:11:23.697" CommentCount="0" />

(Even at the time, much of the information came from questionnaires that he sent out (e.g., to missionaries), rather than from proper anthropological reports, and so was of questionable reliability.) As a result, scholars today generally don't rely on him in making conclusions. Nevertheless, his work is still a valuable, stimulating resource, especially when one is formulating one's own theories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to understand Frazer because he influenced so many others who write about myth (e.g., Jane Harrison, Robert Graves), so it is important to be able to detect Frazer's influence when reading their writings. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before reading even some of Frazer, however, it is important to learn about his background and theories, and their legacy, in order to be able to interpret what he is saying. Unfortunately, in the abridged edition that you are talking about (assuming it is the same Touchstone 1996 edition that I have) there is no introduction by another scholar that could serve this purpose. So the best resource for this purpose is &lt;em&gt;J.G. Frazer: His Life and Work&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Ackerman; if you can afford it, Ackerman's other book, &lt;em&gt;The Myth and Ritual School: J.G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists&lt;/em&gt; is also good in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as whether it is worth reading the whole abridged version (much less the whole 3rd unabridged edition of 12 volumes + vol 13 supplement), this of course would be best if you have the time to do it. In my own case, I did not read it from cover to cover, but consult it (including the full unabridged version) regularly as needed, and over the years I have read probably two-thirds of it by sections, not in order.

However, the basic theme of traditional Chinese folklore does feature an emperor in heaven who is essentially a mirror of the emperor on Earth. The depiction of the Jade Emperor in &lt;em&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/em&gt; matches much of this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Slackers are punished severely.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We see this in, for example, the tragic love story of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weaver_Girl_and_the_Cowherd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Weaver and the Cowherd&lt;/a&gt;.

She is the child of the Celestial Emperor. Year after year she toiled to weave celestial garments, looking busy and disheveled. The Emperor felt sorry for her loneliness, so he married her to the Cowherd from the west bank of the river. She stopped weaving after the wedding. The Emperor was enraged, and punished them by making them return to east and west separately. But he had them meet once per year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here we see the Celestial Emperor reacting to her daughter &lt;s&gt;going on honeymoon&lt;/s&gt; slacking off with inhumane harshness. This is despite the marriage being his own idea and all her previous years of hard work. I would also argue this demonstrates inflexibility and a quickness to anger on the Emperor's part, just as you saw in the novel's version.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The powers of the Jade Emperor is purely authority&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Jade Emperor is essentially the administrator of the heavenly court. Just as the Chinese would not expect the temporal emperor to personally arrest vandalising teenagers, the Jade Emperor metes out punishment and rewards not by doing any work himself, but by exercising his authority as the ruler of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example is the story of Lightening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, Thunder worked alone, striking down people who were wasteful from the clouds. Back then, an impoverished but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pious&lt;/a&gt; woman struggles to provide her mother-in-law with the best. To save on costs, the woman serves the mother white rice, then retreats to the kitchen to eat only &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bran&lt;/a&gt; herself. The mother however suspected the pious woman of keeping the good food for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So one day, she barged in to see for herself what the daughter has been eating. Discovering that the daughter-in-law has been eating bran, the mother was heartbroken. She told the daughter to dump the bran and come eat the good rice with her. Unfortunately, it was  a stormy night and Thunder was patrolling. Upon seeing the pious daughter throwing the bran away, he struck her down, thinking she was wasting perfectly good food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When the Celestial Court heard of this miscarriage of justice, the Emperor was filled with great sympathy. To reward the daughter for her piety, he ennobled her in heaven as Lady Lightening. To prevent another tragedy like hers from happening, Lightening accompanies Thunder out on patrols, and illuminates the earth before the thunder strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;That's why thunders are always preceded by lightening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many variations to this story, but the ending is essentially identical: &lt;em&gt;the Jade Emperor gives a victim &quot;justice&quot; by using his authority as administrator of the Celestial Court&lt;/em&gt; to give her a job in Heaven. Not to raise her from the dead, or give her family a fortune, or do anything really that involves using any sort of divine power. Instead, he issued a decree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The Jade Emperor is short-tempered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese have an ancient saying: &lt;code&gt;伴君如伴虎&lt;/code&gt;, literally, &lt;em&gt;accompanying the ruler is like keeping a tiger company&lt;/em&gt;. Chinese Emperors were notorious for being ill-tempered with little regard for just about anyone else. Since social interactions in the Celestial Realm were imagined based on realities, the Jade Emperor seems to have inherited such traits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An illustration of these traits in folklore &lt;a href=&quot;http://ortho.clmed.ncku.edu.tw/~cjlin/news/8901/890112.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;is the legend&lt;/a&gt; that the Immortal Poet &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Bai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Li Bai&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taibai_Jinxing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Great White Golden Star&lt;/a&gt; in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;李白是天上太白金星，負責昇爐煉丹。太白金星嗜好杯中物，有一天在喝得酩酊大醉之後踢翻了煉丹爐。玉帝大怒，將太白金星貶為凡人，降生於唐朝時的李白&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Great White Golden Star works as an alchemist in heaven.

In fact, even scholarship from as late as the 70s need serious reworking due to new data as well as new understandings. Thus the march of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, there is some good in Frazer. Beyond being entertainment and a wealth of literary inspiration, the basic school in which it is centered, the Cambridge ritualist school, still produces a viable interpretation of ancient myth. Problem is, history, archaeology, and comparative methods have moved far beyond what Frazer was even capable of offering. Barbara Kowalzig's &lt;em&gt;Singing for the Gods&lt;/em&gt; is a great new (well, 2007) book showing how to do it right these days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as for Frazer's book in particular, he is perhaps most outdated by his excessive speculation and assumptions. It is one thing to formulate a hypothesis about an origin of a particular myth or folkloric tale, quite another to ignore many differences between cobbled 'parallels' and make what are quite fanciful reconstructions of &quot;savage humanity&quot; from them, generalizing without controlling for locally-produced or contextually-driven origins. It's not sound scholarship to assume your version first and then assume divergent versions diverge from your assumed version. Frazer is guilty of this to the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, he adds details where necessary to fit his theory. Even the central thesis, as many over the years have noticed, is quite an imaginative interpretation of a very innocent events. The question he originally attempted was good enough, essentially &quot;What's up with the priesthood of Diana of Nemi?&quot; What he ended up with—priest-kings, scapegoats, and complex, magical rituals—is missing from the scene, which, of course, must be why he generally dropped it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this and we're ignoring the major shift in anthropology which realized long ago that the &quot;progress from savagery to civilization&quot; is a false progress (the &quot;stages&quot; are a great example of bad generalization based on one flawed sample), that primordial mythology of &quot;savage beings&quot; is imaginary, a tall tale of the Victorian world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for entertainment, it undoubtedly is, and its influence is legendary, but no, do not read it for an understanding the complex history of quite nearly anything he says. He has flashes of insight, but you'd be better off looking elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to look at some criticism of Frazer, I'd recommend these articles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beard, M. 1978. &quot;Judgments on James Frazer.&quot; &lt;em&gt;Daedalus&lt;/em&gt; 107.4: 151–164.&#xA;-- 1992. &quot;Frazer, Leach, and Virgil &lt;em&gt;Comparative Studies in Society and History&lt;/em&gt; 34.2: 203–224.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leach, E. 1961. &quot;Golden Bough or Gilded Twig?&quot; &lt;em&gt;Daedalus&lt;/em&gt; 90: 371–399.&#xA;-- 1965. &quot;On the 'Founding Fathers.' &quot; &lt;em&gt;Encounter&lt;/em&gt; 25: 24–36.&#xA;-- 1985. &quot;Reflections on a Visit to Nemi&quot; &lt;em&gt;Anthropology Today&lt;/em&gt; 2–3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Smith, J.

While Athena represented wisdom, strategy and generalship in war, Ares represented base aggression and the brutal side of war.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As such, he wasn't particularly well regarded by the greek populace, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britannica.com/topic/Ares-Greek-mythology&quot;&gt;instances of his worship are relatively sparse&lt;/a&gt;.

Soldiers swore oaths to him (Mars Gradivus) to be valorous in battle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edith Hamilton's &quot;Mythology&quot; has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Romans liked Mars better than the Greeks liked Ares.

The warriors of the great Latin heroic poem, the &lt;em&gt;Aeneid&lt;/em&gt;, far from rejoicing to escape from him, rejoice when they see that they are to fall &quot;on Mars' field of renown.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interesting take on the matter, is that perhaps, in terms of function, Mars and Ares aren't really the most directly comparable, but rather that Mars is more directly related to Athena, and that the inheritor of Ares's function is the goddess Bellona, as posited in this thesis:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, Roman religion recognized a male warrior god with both agricultural/fertility and martial aspects.  Roman religion attributed a much more defensive mentality to Mars than the Greeks attributed to Ares.  With no push for imperialism in early Rome, the female goddess associated with rage (Bellona) did not emerge into prominence until Sulla.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  In the observations made up to this point, a chiastic inversion occurs between Greek and Roman religions.

For example, in the book of Daniel (in biblical literature), the troubling dreams of the kings are announced, though no details are given for the sake of the literature. The point is that the king is &quot;testing&quot; his subjects, and will reward the interpreter that both knows what the dream is and can interpret it. Such a test, though, is a concocted fantasy of the literature; the main takeaway for us is that royal dreams are shared. (For more on this point, see M. H. Henze 1999 &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=u1By9tEjh6AC&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Madness of King Nebuchadnezzar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Brill.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A similar trial is done in Herodotus' &lt;em&gt;Histories&lt;/em&gt;, in which the Lydian king Croesus asks Greek oracles about a dream, and only Delphi both knows what the dream is and correctly interprets it. Again, the secrecy and test are fictional, but dreams being shared fits a larger pattern of dream reports in the Ancient Near East.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The standard reference for the so-called &quot;dream reports&quot; is Oppenheim's 1956 &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=hlxTywAACAAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation of Dreams in the Ancient Near East&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was followed up well by Robert Gnuse's 1996 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=l23258NI8nQC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Dreams and Dream Reports in the Writings of Josephus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is online if you want a fuller history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for Oppenheim, I quote K. Bulkley, who summarizes the main point better than I could:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Oppenheim claims that almost all of these dream accounts have a primarily literary function, serving as plot devices used deliberately by the authors. Consequently, Oppenheim asserts that psychological inquiry into these dreams is vain, for it is highly unlikely, and impossible to prove, that these reports are based on genuine dream experiences (Oppenheim 1956, 185).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bulkley then goes on, in fact, to examine Gilgamesh. She starts from where Oppenheim leaves off—that Gilgamesh fits this pattern—but then notes the differences, chiefly by observing that &quot;all the dreams in &lt;em&gt;Gilgamesh&lt;/em&gt;) are evil dreams—frightening, confusing nightmares of struggle, violence, and death&quot; (161). This type of dream, like Nebuchadnezzar's in Daniel, &quot;require interpretation,&quot; and thus are not out of bounds to fall into the type that would be communicated as Gilgamesh does with Ninsun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;K.

The word is &lt;em&gt;nagbu&lt;/em&gt;, and there appear to be two main translations to consider.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Totality, all things&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Abyss, or deep&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The former seems to be the most common in translations.  The latter was chosen here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While totality may be the most common in the many translations of Gilgamesh, that may not mean it's strictly the correct choice.  Generally, where I can find more in depth explanations on the translation of this particular passage, abyss is often the preferred choice.  Their reasoning for the preference refers to usage patterns of the term nagbu in the text, contextual arguments, and the observation that it is reasonably likely to be a reference to the depths appearing later in the story, when Gilgamesh meets Utnapishtim:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...the standard version's incipit is &quot;He who saw the deep&quot; (ša nagbu amāru). The Akkadian word nagbu, &quot;deep&quot;, is probably to be interpreted here as referring to &quot;unknown mysteries&quot;. However, Andrew George believes that it refers to the specific knowledge that Gilgamesh brought back from his meeting with Uta-Napishti (Utnapishtim): he gains knowledge of the realm of Ea, whose cosmic realm is seen as the fountain of wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ancient.eu/article/191/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Epic of Gilgamesh in Prose&lt;/a&gt;, Jan van der Crabben&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, John Gardner chooses &quot;abyss&quot; is his translation, but argues that the term may have originally been used to intentionally convey multiple meanings:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;em&gt;nagbu&lt;/em&gt;, which we have translated &quot;the abyss&quot; for the many resorances that the term retains.  The term &lt;em&gt;nagbu&lt;/em&gt; had a range of meanings, from &quot;spring&quot; and &quot;fountain&quot; and &quot;underground water&quot;--all of particularly great important in arid Mesopotamia, where water is life--to meaning found in poetic texts, &quot;totality,&quot; the all.  Even as the source of water, it is often used as an epithet of the gods, especially the god whose &quot;place&quot; is the &lt;em&gt;abzu&lt;/em&gt; ...

As stated in the first quote above, though, Andrew George seems to have concluded that this phrase refers primarily to the knowledge gained with Utnapishtim.  His choice of the word &quot;Deep&quot; seems to fall on the side of &quot;the abyss&quot;, while favoring a term usage which begs multiple interpretations, to maintain the possible uncertainty.  The word Deep is used in modern english to refer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deepthoughtsbyjackhandey.com/category/3x5/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;profound knowledge/wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, or a physical quality of depth, or the sea, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the multiple meanings of &lt;em&gt;nagbu&lt;/em&gt;, I would guess the use of such a loaded word with so many possible meanings is a deliberate one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2015-07-17T23:18:59.770" LastActivityDate="2015-07-17T23:18:59.770" CommentCount="0" />

This theme is especially prominent in stories about supernatural marriages, where the suitor has to venture into the supernatural world and bring back a wife. The father of the bride, and by extension the supernatural world, is usually hostile to the suitor's attempt attempt, and sets various challenges before the suitor (examples in this story being the bread challenge and the Gwyn's task to identify his bride from two identical woman).

However, the meaning of this varies between characters. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some instances, having multiple pupils is a sign that the character has an &quot;evil eye.&quot; For example, in the Togail Bruidne Da Derga (The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel), a character with multiple pupils causes a juggler to drop his objects:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A man ungentle, huge, fearful, uncouth was Ingcél. A single eye in his head, as broad as an oxhide, as black as a chafer, with three pupils therein.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When he was swiftest, I beheld him at the feat, and as I looked, they uttered a cry about him and they were all on the house-floor. Then the Prince who is in the house said to the juggler: ‘We have come together since thou wast a little boy, and till to-night thy juggling never failed thee.’’&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;‘Alas, alas, fair master Conaire, good cause have I. A keen, angry eye looked at me: a man with the third of a pupil which sees the going of the nine bands. Not much to him is that keen, wrathful sight!

To quote from this fantastic paper titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://bill.celt.dias.ie/vol4/displayObject.php?TreeID=1001&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;'The Evil Eye' in early Irish literature and law&lt;/a&gt; (which is essentially the source for this entire answer):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The version that Ingcél has seven pupils in his eye has a parallel&#xA;  in descriptions of Cormac mac Airt and Cú Chulainn: they are&#xA;  said to have seven pupils in each eye. In both cases, this is explictly&#xA;  qualified as a sign of beauty. In Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension I, two of&#xA;  Cú Chulainn’s pupils are described as squinting, but the text supplies the&#xA;  comment that this was more an adornment than a disfigurement. The&#xA;  tradition of three pupils in Ingcél’s eye could be compared with another&#xA;  instance in Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension I: after the description of the&#xA;  poetess and prophetess Fedelm as a beautiful woman, it is said that she&#xA;  carries a weaver’s beam and has three pupils in each eye. There is no&#xA;  explanation offered of this characteristic: it could be a sign of beauty&#xA;  and it could be a sign of her supernatural sight. The latter is more&#xA;  probable, because the characteristic is separated from the description of&#xA;  her looks by the mention of the weaver’s beam. The weaver’s beam has&#xA;  been interpreted as a supernatural tool for prophesy. The triple pupils&#xA;  could, therefore, very well be a symbol of her clairvoyance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Borsje, Jacqueline; Kelly, Fergus: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bill.celt.dias.ie/vol4/displayObject.php?TreeID=1001&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;'The evil eye' in early Irish literature and law.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summery, depending on the character and story, having multiple pupils is associated with (rarely) beauty, sharp site (i.e. clairvoyance), or destruction (i.e. &quot;the evil eye&quot;). However, I think you can connect those &quot;symptoms&quot; back to the evil eye; for example, being able to see the future/see well is one of the characteristics of having the evil eye, although in the Táin it's portrayed more positively. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend that you take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bill.celt.dias.ie/vol4/displayObject.php?TreeID=1001&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the paper I cited about the evil eye&lt;/a&gt;: it's very interesting and connects the phenomenon to Irish law and a variety of non-Irish texts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastEditorUserId="62" LastEditDate="2015-08-19T22:59:46.357" LastActivityDate="2015-08-19T22:59:46.357" CommentCount="2" />

Ye have given counsel that the mortar thereof should be slacked of my blood, that so the tower should stand forthwith. Now tell me, what is it that lieth hid beneath the foundation, for somewhat is there that doth not allow it to stand?' But the wizards were adread and held their peace. Then saith Merlin, that is also called Ambrosius: 'My lord the King, call thy workmen and bid delve the soil, and a pool shalt thou find beneath it that doth forbid thy tower to stand.' And when this was done, straightway a pool was found under the earth, the which had made the soil unconstant. Then Ambrosius Merlin again came nigh unto the wizards and saith: 'Tell me now, ye lying flatterers, what is it that is under the pool?' But they were all dumb and answered&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;{p. 169}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;{marg The magicians dumbfounded}unto him never a word. And again spake he unto the King, saying: 'Command, O King, that the pool be drained by conduits, and in the bottom thereof shalt thou behold two hollow stones and therein two dragons asleep.' The King, believing his words for that he had spoken true as touching the pool, commanded also that the pool should be drained. And when he found that it was even as Merlin had said he marvelled greatly. All they that stood by were no less astonished at such wisdom being found in him, deeming that he was possessed of some spirit of God.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Additional Commentary&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, here's some additional commentary on the triad. First, Will Parker discusses the purpose of the triads:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, the burial of the fighting dragons at the end of this episodes recalls the talismanic concealment of Bendigeidfrân’s mortal remains at the end of the Second Branch, or those of Gwrthefyr as described in the Historia. The subsequent unearthing of these protective talismans is often lamented in the Welsh tradition, and is often used to explain why later generations were unable to resist the threatening gormesoedd as effectively as their mythological ancestors. As such, these ‘fortunate concealments’ and ‘unfortunate disclosures’ play an important part in the meta-narrative of sovereignty, loss and eventual restoration which we have seen played such a central role in Medievel Welsh historiography. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Will Parker, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mabinogion.info/llud.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mabinogion.info&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here's a quote discussion the inclusion of a dragon burial into the triad we're discussing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As Ifor Willaims showed, the story of the burial of the dragons as given in Lludd a Llefelys is so closely dependent on HB's account of their disclosure as to indicate that this tale was invented subsequently to the ninth-century redaction of HB. Is it possible that in the triad the burial of the dragons has supplanted a third story of human talismanic burial? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=V2muBwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;dq=trioedd+ynys+prydein+the+welsh+triads+buy&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Triads of the Island of Britain&lt;/a&gt;.

Otherwise, the accepted answer was pretty much the last edit of my post. While it's still probable that Bram Stoker did not think of the &quot;no reflection&quot; feature, it's considered his invention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vampires:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vampires are ancient Balkan mythological being. The word actually depicts pretty much any form of non ethereal undead (contrary to the popular belief of capes, fangs and etc). As such their soul usually passed on to the next world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was believed that the mirror holds and reflects a part of your soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like VixenPopuli said it can't reflect what you don't own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This also explains why Chinese vampires are terrified of their reflection, because they are reminded that they have no soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also. back in the past, mirrors were made out of silver, and actually Balkan werewolves are considered a type of a vampire, so... if you add 2+2 u get 4. &lt;strong&gt;It's quite possible that the modern myth is a combination of the silver and soul reflection theories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of the earlier myths... lol we are talking about centuries BC. Times before any written language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words it's impossible to tell how it appeared, but the most plausible theories are: &lt;strong&gt;No soul, thus No reflection&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bram Stoker's imagination and bad translations, born from lack of understanding.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mean, Bram Stoker did pretty lame job at describing the vampires, but they were sort of &quot;the thing&quot; back in the days and everybody just went along with it, which eventually brought us Edward the sparkling fairy. So I won't be surprised if someone told him that vampires are terrified of mirrors, and he tried to guess why, which spawned the myth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: FAST google search:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%80&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protobulgarians.com/PODSTRANITSA%20NA%20DR%20ZHIVKO%20VOYNIKOV/PRALULG-DIAL-DUM-1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Link from the bibliography.

(&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt; Off Topic):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gypsies are afraid of vampires and will not enter their territories. Actually they are far more superstitious than normal people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wooden stake - Actually is a specific type of wood. Cornus also known  as dogwood. And it is not required to be a stake. Even a needle will help you. Since vampires are considered something like giant balloons full of blood. The word that describes the item is Шип which can be translated as pretty much everything in between a stake, spike and a big needle. Depending on the dialect. Also the heart is also a myth. &lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; this thing about the wood is only about the Balkan Vampires,the Chinese ones are slain by peach tree. So it can only be a tree that destroys evil. In other words a wooden stake will not help you in 905 of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He completely skipped the &quot;cut their feet&quot; part. Yeah, you can kill vampires by cutting their feet so that won't get up and attack the living, which will make em die of starvation. Which is pretty much the usual way vampires were killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don't fear vampires, they gang up to slay them when they are still young.

This time on Vampire myths instead of Stoker's mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no popular, written story dating prior to Bram Stoker, claiming that vampires are not reflected in mirrors. Actually there are many things about vampires that appeared after Stoker wrote his novel. I wonder why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vampires, and bloodsuckers in general are far older than the bible itself and appear through out the history in almost all mythology from China to Egypt and eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only known ancient vampires, prior to the book Dracula, that were related to mirrors, were the Chinese ones. Also they had reflection, it's just that it scared them instead of not appearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stoker spawned a huge cult to his creation, not the mythological being vampyr. The Mythological creature vampyr is only remotely related to Dracula. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mirror is most probably derivation created from combining various sources describing different types of vampires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also another shady source: Knowing your country's history. Also there were many authors that Mentioned in many of their books, the original vampires. Authors like Jordan Radichkov, Ivan Vazov and many others. They all describe different vampires.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 3:&lt;/strong&gt; There are people that actually said it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, I came back and did a quick google search.

Castriota 1992, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&amp;amp;pg=PA106&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myth, Ethos, and Actuality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, U. Wisconsin Press, p. 106.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can see an example here. Notice the different costumes of Aphrodite (tall, in the middle, wearing typical Greek dress) and the Trojans (Aeneas on the left, Paris on the right).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Emtwt.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Emtwt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many have seen the juxtaposition of Persian War scenes and Trojan War scenes on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metopes_of_the_Parthenon&quot;&gt;Metopes of the Parthenon&lt;/a&gt; to indicate a symbolic relationship between the two (cf. e.g. A. Stewart 1990 &lt;em&gt;Greek Sculpture: An Exploration&lt;/em&gt;, Yale Press, p. 250-252).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not surprising that Herodotus begins his narrative of the Persian War with a rationalized account of the Trojan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While that's not technically allegory, there were others who did make the war fully allegorical. Lamberton in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=aV80E_Vb2CgC&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homer the Theologian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (UC Press, 1989) notes that there seemed to be a general agreement that the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;would traditionally have been read as allegory, most often moral allegory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(p. 224)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of the allegorization came from a defense of Homer and the gods from attacks by the Platonists. Plato himself censured Homer in his &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt;. In the first century CE, Heraclitus (not to be confused with the Pre-Socratic philosopher from the late sixth/early fifth century!) penned his &lt;em&gt;Homeric Allegories&lt;/em&gt;. His work is primarily Euhemeristic, in that they're:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;either physical allegories—claims that the poems represent forces or elements of the natural world as gods—or ethical ones that stress edifying concealed messages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(R. Lamberton, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=JuPiXNhC-fIC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Homer in Antiquity&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; in Morris and Powell eds. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=JuPiXNhC-fIC&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&quot;&gt;A New Companion to Homer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Brill 1997, p. 52)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picking up from the Platonic allegory, the Neo-Platonists developed Homer's Trojan War into an allegory of the soul (which is, after all, what the Utopian &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt; is really all about). I quote Anne Sheppard's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=lt1O7nUYA1YC&quot;&gt;Studies on the 5th and 6th Essays of Proclus'&lt;/em&gt; Commentary on the &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (pp. 40–41):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Proclus and Syrianus allegorised Homer in metaphysical and theological terms and sought to show the harmony between poetry, religion and philosophy. As a result myths, including Homeric myths, do make tantalisingly brief appearances in Syrianus' commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There are good grounds for thinking that systemic allegory of Homer in terms of transcendent metaphysical entities was first developed by Syrianus. Writers like Philo and Origen occasionally allegorise Biblical persons and events in terms of metaphysics; Porphyry's &lt;em&gt;De antro nympharum&lt;/em&gt; uses Neoplatonist concepts in its interpretation of the grotto in &lt;em&gt;Od&lt;/em&gt;. 13 [i.e. Homer's &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; book 13 - CW] and refers to a full-scale allegory of the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; by Numenius in terms of the journey of the soul; but nowhere before Proclus and Syrianus is there a detailed and systematic application of the Homeric myths to the sphere of transcendent metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sheppard gives several examples of allegorising, such as &quot;Zeus and Hera representing the monad and the dyad&quot; (for what that is, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge#Henology&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;), of which there is a very nice discussion in Sheppard's book, and the death of the twelve captives by Achilles as symbolizing the demiurge. Other examples in Proclus include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/JudgementParis.html&quot;&gt;Judgment of Paris&lt;/a&gt;, where he makes the choosing of the goddesses an allegory for different lifestyles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Proclus's understanding of the meaning of the story is that it &quot;hints at&quot; (αἰνίττεται) the choice among lives of different sorts, the regal (Hera), the philosophical (apparently Athena), and the erotic (Aphrodite). An important source for this is to be found in two passages of the &lt;em&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/em&gt; [i.e. a work by Plato - CW], but the passages from Plato are not very well suited to the explanation of the myth, and Procus must twist them considerably in the attempt to make them appear so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Lamberton 1997, p. 202ff.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One further thing of note, Proclus most certainly thinks that Homer himself is allegorizing, and that as a poet, he is simultaneously crafting both layers, the plain meaning and the allegory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="398" LastEditorUserId="398" LastEditDate="2015-07-26T09:21:45.263" LastActivityDate="2015-07-26T09:21:45.263" CommentCount="0" />

Like the Irish tradition, the Welsh can be further divided into solitary and social fairies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34704/34704-h/34704-h.htm&quot;&gt;the text of &lt;em&gt;British Goblins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where Sikes states (at the start of Chapter II)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Fairies being creatures of the imagination, it is not possible to classify them by fixed and immutable rules. In the exact sciences, there are laws which never vary, or if they vary, their very eccentricity is governed by precise rules. Even in the largest sense, comparative mythology must demean itself modestly in order to be tolerated in the severe company of the sciences. In presenting his subjects, therefore, the writer in this field can only govern himself by the purpose of orderly arrangement. To secure the maximum of system, for the sake of the student who employs the work for reference and comparison, with the minimum of dullness, for the sake of the general reader, is perhaps the limit of a reasonable ambition. Keightley[8] divides into four classes the Scandinavian elements of popular belief as to fairies, viz.:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The Elves;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The Dwarfs, or Trolls;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The Nisses; and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The Necks, [12] Mermen, and Mermaids.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How entirely arbitrary this division is, the student of Scandinavian folk-lore at once perceives. Yet it is perhaps as satisfactory as another. The fairies of Wales may be divided into five classes, if analogy be not too sharply insisted on. Thus we have&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The Ellyllon, or elves;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The Coblynau, or mine fairies;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The Bwbachod, or household fairies;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The Gwragedd Annwn, or fairies of the lakes and streams; and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The Gwyllion, or mountain fairies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Keightley&quot; refers to Thomas Keightley, the author of &lt;em&gt;Fairy Mythology&lt;/em&gt;, from 1870. I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/index.htm&quot;&gt;an index of all its parts&lt;/a&gt;. This is certainly harder to search through, but in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm132.htm&quot;&gt;his analysis on Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, Keightley writes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The fairies of Ireland can hardly be said to differ in any respect from those of England and Scotland. Like them they are of diminutive size, rarely exceeding two feet in height; they live also in society, their ordinary abode being the interior of the mounds, called in Irish, Raths (Rahs), in English, Moats, the construction of which is, by the peasantry, ascribed to the Danes from whom, it might thence perhaps be inferred, the Irish got their fairies direct and not vid England.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm131.htm&quot;&gt;the more general summary of Celtic fairies&lt;/a&gt;, he writes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Yet in the popular creed of all these tribes, we meet at the present day beings exactly corresponding to the Dwarfs and Fairies of the Gotho-German nations. Of these beings there is no mention in any works--such as the Welsh Poems, and Mabinogion, the Poems of Ossian, or the different irish poems and romances--which can by any possibility lay claim to an antiquity anterior to the conquests of the Northmen. Is it not then a reasonable supposition that the Picts, Saxons, and other sons of the North, brought with them their Dwarfs and Kobolds, and communicated the knowledge of, and belief in, them to their Celtic and Cymric subjects and neighbours? Proceeding on this theory, we have placed the Celts and Cymry next to and after the Gotho-German nations, though they are perhaps their precursors in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm105.htm&quot;&gt;his introduction to the fairies of Great Britain as a whole&lt;/a&gt; (though perhaps ecluding the Celts), he writes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We have already seen that the Anglo-Saxon conquerors of Britain had in their language the terms from which are derived Elf and Dwarf, and the inference is natural that their ideas respecting these beings corresponded with those of the Scandinavians and Germans. The same may be said. of the Picts, who, akin to the Scandinavians, early seized on the Scottish Lowlands. We therefore close our survey of the Fairy Mythology of the Gotho-German race with Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there are quite a few parallels between Norse elves and Celtic fairies:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The elves are akin to the ellyllon&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The dwarves and trolls are akin to the coblynau&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nisses are akin to the bwbachod&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The necks, men and mermaids are akin to the gwragedd annwn&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="183" LastEditorUserId="183" LastEditDate="2015-08-03T11:50:57.060" LastActivityDate="2015-08-03T11:50:57.060" CommentCount="0" />

They share the same name essentially only because of translation choices; there is fundamentally no reason why Chinese dragons shouldn't be different to European ones.

The Ming Dynasty and scholar doctor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Shizhen&quot;&gt;Li Shih-chen&lt;/a&gt; writes in his magnum opus the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compendium_of_Materia_Medica&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compendium of Materia Medica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;龍者，鱗蟲之長也，王符言其形有九似：眼似兔，角似鹿，嘴似牛，頭似駝，身似蛇，腹似蜃，鱗似魚，爪似鷹，掌似虎 ... 口旁有鬚冉，頜下有明珠。&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Dragons are the first of the scaled beasts. Wang Fu says it resembles nine animals: eyes like rabbits, antlers like deers, mouth like cows, head like camels, body like snakes, belly like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_(clam-monster)&quot;&gt;shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, scales like fish, claws like eagles, and paws like tigers ... its mouth is bearded, and there's a bright pearl below is jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More relevant to visual depictions, a traditional mantra for dragon painting is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;一畫鹿角二蝦目，三畫狗鼻四牛嘴，五畫獅鬃六魚鱗，七畫蛇身八火炎，九畫雞胸。&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  First, deer antlers. Second, shrimp eyes. Third, dog nose. Fourth, cow mouth. &lt;strong&gt;Fifth, lion's mane.&lt;/strong&gt; Sixth, fish scales. Seventh, snake's body. Eighth, fire flames. Ninth, chicken's breast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These traditional descriptions of dragons also gives us some insight into why the Chinese version has hair. Whereas the European dragon has a strong reptilian quality, their Asian counterparts are considered a &lt;strong&gt;composite of different beasts - many of whom has plenty of hair&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, despite a (probably) serpentine origin, the Chinese dragons acquired hair on the head and limbs.

Rather intimidating all told.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fullest description occurs after the slaying of the boy troop of Emain Macha.  Kinsella's translation puts it this way:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The first warp-spasm seized Cúchulainn, and made him into a monstrous thing, hideous and shapeless, unheard of. His shanks and his joints, every knuckle and angle and organ from head to foot, shook like a tree in the flood or a reed in the stream. His body made a furious twist inside his skin, so that his feet and shins switched to the rear and his heels and calves switched to the front... On his head the temple-sinews stretched to the nape of his neck, each mighty, immense, measureless knob as big as the head of a month-old child... he sucked one eye so deep into his head that a wild crane couldn't probe it onto his cheek out of the depths of his skull; the other eye fell out along his cheek. His mouth weirdly distorted: his cheek peeled back from his jaws until the gullet appeared, his lungs and his liver flapped in his mouth and throat, his lower jaw struck the upper a lion-killing blow, and fiery flakes large as a ram's fleece reached his mouth from his throat... The hair of his head twisted like the tangle of a red thornbush stuck in a gap; if a royal apple tree with all its kingly fruit were shaken above him, scarce an apple would reach the ground but each would be spiked on a bristle of his hair as it stood up on his scalp with rage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is actually fairly concise, compared to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://adminstaff.vassar.edu/sttaylor/Cooley/ScythedChariot.html&quot;&gt;very direct translation of Joseph Dunn&lt;/a&gt;, which goes on for four paragraphs in full description of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Then took place the first twisting-fit and rage of the royal hero Cuchulain, so that he made a terrible, many-shaped, wonderful, unheard of thing of himself. His flesh trembled about him like a pole against the torrent or like a bulrush against the stream, every member and every joint and every point and every knuckle of him from crown to ground. He made a mad whirling-feat of his body within his hide. His feet and his shins and his knees slid so that they came behind him. His heels and his calves and his hams shifted so that they passed to the front. The muscles of his calves moved so that they came to the front of his shins, so that each huge knot was the size of a soldier's balled fist. He stretched the sinews of his head so that they stood out on the nape of his neck, hill-like lumps, huge, incalculable, vast, immeasurable and as large as the head of a month-old child.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;He next made a ruddy bowl of his face and his countenance. He gulped down one eye into his head so that it would be hard work if a wild crane succeeded in drawing it out on to the middle of his cheek from the rear of his skull. Its mate sprang forth till it came out on his cheek. His mouth was distorted monstrously. He drew the cheek from the jaw-bone so that the interior of his throat was to be seen. His lungs and his lights stood out so that they fluttered in his mouth and his gullet. He struck a mad lion's blow with the upper jaw on its fellow so that as large as a wether's fleece of a three year old was each red, fiery flake which his teeth forced into his mouth from his gullet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There was heard the loud clap of his heart against his breast like the yelp of a howling bloodhound or like a lion going among bears. There were seen the torches of the Badb, and the rain clouds of poison, and the sparks of glowing-red fire, blazing and flashing in hazes and mists over his head with the seething of the truly wild wrath that rose up above him. His hair bristled all over his head like branches of a redthorn thrust into a gap in a great hedge. Had a king's apple-tree laden with royal fruit been shaken around him, scarce an apple of them all would have passed over him to the ground, but rather would an apple have stayed stuck on each single hair there, for the twisting of the anger which met it as it rose from his hair above him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Lon Laith ('Champion's Light') stood out of his forehead, so that it was as long and as thick as a warrior's whetstone. As high, as thick, as strong, as steady, as long as the sail-tree of some huge prime ship was the straight spout of dark blood which arose right on high from the very ridge-pole of his crown, so that a black fog of witchery was made thereof like to the smoke from a king's hostel what time the king comes to be ministered to at nightfall of a winter's day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, a number of comics have been made about and inspired by Cuchulain and the Tain.

This would be most inline with Italic and Etruscan Gods, who lived in the skies, upon teh earth, under the earth, in the waters. A river god would live in his river, a goddess of the land in her land. The lares and penates lived in the houses or with the families they protected. This has been published widely (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bronze-Liver-Piacenza-Polytheistic-Archaeology/dp/9070265419/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1439394945&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=piacenza+liver&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;L.B. van der Meer, 1987&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jupiter, like most Roman deities is most cognate with Etruscan and Italic deities. When the Romans conquered Greece, they found many similarities between their own gods and goddesses and those of the Greeks. The most likely explanation is that many (though not all) of the Greek gods were derived of Etruscan origins, like the Roman gods. Others were from the East, such as Dionysos, and Hekate.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that the Roman pantheon was &quot;infected&quot; with Greek influences, before Greece was conquered, as the only similarities are the ones that likely stem from Etruscan origin. Not a single Greek influence that was of Eastern origin made it into Roman mythology until well after the contacts with Greek colonies in Southern Italy or even the conquest of Greece, which would be statistically most unlikely if the Greeks had &quot;infected&quot; the Roman pantheon before they were conquered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would therefore surprise me if Roman Gods lived on Mount Olympos. I think it would be almost impossible for such a notion to have existed in the centuries of Roman mythology before the conquest of Greece, and even after the conquest of Greece, if such a change had happened, one would have assumed there would be explicit mentioning of this. More explicit than Seneca's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Text/SenecaHerculesFurens.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hercules Furens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if later in the Roman empire there had been &quot;infection&quot; of Roman religious beliefs by Greek mythology, and even if every single text proving that got lost, does Hercules Furens prove anything. In that text Seneca never claims any God lives on Olympos. He only says Jupiter &lt;i&gt;rules&lt;/i&gt; Olympos, but in the same play Jupiter is said to rule several other places as well: the infernal world (line 46-62 and 592-615), the heavens (line 709-730) and all fires (line 926-938). If ruling something means he lives in it, then at the very least Jupiter lives in many places.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many Roman deities have epiteths tying them to a place.

Before the epic of Gilgamesh was put together as one single narrative, hymns of Gilgamesh were performed separately. These are the Sumerian predecessors of what's commonly read today. They can fortunately for us be easily found on the internet at &lt;a href=&quot;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.8.1*&quot;&gt;The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there were several hymns in the Gilgamesh cycle, and the bull of Heaven is one of them. All of these except Gilgamesh and Aga were eventually incorporated into a single narrative. This seems to have happened first ca. 2000-1600 BCE. What's often translated and put into books, however, is a recension of this text made roughly a thousand years later. By that time, it would be too late to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Historically, the scene has to be rather late overall. The original story was probably the hymn of &lt;a href=&quot;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.1&quot;&gt;Gilgamesh and Aga&lt;/a&gt;. Aga (also Akka) in the myths was the son of Enmebaragesi, king of Kish, whom we know now was actually a real person from inscriptions&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=bCn5-COYETwC&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. A plausible scenario for the development of Gilgamesh follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Enmebaragesi of Kish ruled over Sumer, and was succeeded by Aga, who was then conquered by Gilgamesh of Uruk, leading to Uruk's predominance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could have (and would have) been ritually performed at Uruk, where Gilgamesh could then fade into legends. Furthermore, other myths would be attracted to it. First, the Humbaba quest likely originated with the Ur III dynasty.&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=cxjuHTH6I2sC&amp;amp;pg=PA78&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Originally entirely separate from the Gilgamesh cycle, the story of Dumuzi and Inanna is well chronicled in the Sumerian literature. You can also read them at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.4*&quot;&gt;ETCSL&lt;/a&gt;. The older view, established by Frazer, was to see Dumuzi was a dying and rising fertility god, but as JoAnn Scurlock points out, the evidence for that is very weak.&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=9UeVAQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA161&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Instead, he appears to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;embrace [the onerous duties of kingship], and to suffer the ultimate penalty for failure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=9UeVAQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA172&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this reading is correct, it explains why Dumuzi, lover of Inanna (later Ishtar) became the predecessor of Gilgamesh (and defeater of Enmebaragesi), itself evidenced by the unusual name appearing as a doublet (he's distinguished in the sources, but it's clear it was one name that became two).&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=5gUNVtrlr28C&amp;amp;pg=PA102&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Dumuzi would be the example of a king failing at his duties, while Gilgamesh would have been a good king (the part about Gilgamesh being a bad king in the beginning is missing in the Sumerian hymns and is presumably a later addition).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ritually, it appears that there was a differentiation of some sort between Dumuzi and Gilgamesh. The Inanna/Dumuzi relationship looks similar to other goddess/dead mortal ones. Beyond them, we have Adonis and Aphrodite (Adonis actually comes from the Semitic root &lt;em&gt;adon&lt;/em&gt; which means &quot;lord&quot;, and was a title for Tammuz, the Babylonian version of Dumuzi; Aphrodite has similar myths to Inanna/Ishtar, e.g. she's insulted by Diomedes in the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; and reacts suspiciously similar to Ishtar when she's insulted by Gilgamesh, i.e. going up to heaven and crying to her parents; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Iliad5.htm#_Toc239244903&quot;&gt;Homer, &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt;, 5.297–430&lt;/a&gt;), Cybele and Attis, and perhaps too Aphrodite and Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These couples mean something—though what exactly it's difficult to say—about the function of kingship in ancient Sumer and Babylon. The king was also the chief priest, and there seems to be some sort of relationship between the king and the goddess, as you can see from my post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/962/are-there-kali-types-deities-in-other-pantheons/965#965&quot;&gt;Shulgi and Inanna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point we can only speculate, but perhaps Gilgamesh's rejection of her is tied to a religious dispute or a political dispute? If there is any truth about Gilgamesh's involvement in the building of the temple of Ninlil as recorded in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tummal_Inscription&quot;&gt;Tummal inscription&lt;/a&gt;, then there might have been rivalry between worshipers of Ninlil and Inanna that played out in Gilgamesh's favoring of the former over the latter. It's difficult to say for sure, and of course, all this is not only hypothetical, but also likely to remain unanswerable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Interestingly, Homer in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Iliad5.htm#_Toc239244903&quot;&gt;Iliadic parallel&lt;/a&gt;, used it for polemic against the claims of Aphrodite as a warrior goddess, since Zeus chides her for trying to engage in combat. We know that in Cyprus, where there was a strong Phoenician population, Aphrodite &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; dressed in warrior garb. I think there's something there.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/j-fish/galleries/72157632964336921/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/8l9hj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aphrodite in warrior garb.

Mosaic, found in Paphos, Cyprus)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Narratologically, the inclusion of the scene makes sense for the overall story, and in fact is one of the more important parts. One of the important themes of the work as a whole is the acceptance of death for mortals. Recall that the original impetus for the slaying of Humbaba is for eternal glory: &quot;I will establish for ever a name eternal!&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=eCZRK_61adMC&amp;amp;pg=PA20&quot;&gt;Y 187&lt;/a&gt;, trans. Andrew George). In order for Gilgamesh to really seek out immortality (almost always denied to mortals, with Ziusudra being the one exception), he must gain a reason for wanting it. This is accomplished in the death of his friend, Enkidu. And who else, except Inanna, who already was responsible for the death of Dumuzi, would be implicated? The association between the two would be even stronger since there are hints of immortality in the Dumuzi hymns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus this scene provides that pivotal climax which leads him to seek out immortality and ultimately the acceptance of his fate, since it is Enkidu from the Netherworld he sees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;General Bibliography&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jean-Jacques Glassner and Benhamin R.

There were tigers in the region which made nobody dare to travel alone.

  <row Id="1064" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1056" CreationDate="2015-08-18T02:37:49.697" Score="8" Body="&lt;p&gt;I understand the question to be asking what is the author’s intent in having Gilgamesh describe Ishtar’s prior lovers in the way he does, and what, as a literary matter, did the author want to convey through that scene.  I agree with Jeffrey Tigay (p. 42) that there was a single creative mind behind the Old Babylonian, Akkadian text, who deserves to be viewed as an author, not simply as a complier or editor of earlier textual sources and myths. From this perspective, looking at the background of other myths is necessary and helpful, but we know that creative authors do change earlier material around for their own purposes, so in the end we must figure out the authorial intent. Since the earlier answer has already covered the Sumerian general background well, I’ll not dwell on that myself but focus on authorial intent. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said that, however, I should mention that the Sumerian myth &lt;em&gt;Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven&lt;/em&gt; (see on &lt;a href=&quot;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.2#&quot;&gt;ETCSL&lt;/a&gt;) is fairly relevant here. In that story Inanna is upset at Gilgamesh because he seems to want to usurp her ceremonial functions at the Eanna temple (and also spend too much time hunting in the wilds), and so she sends the Bull of Heaven after him, which he and Enkidu kill as in the Gilgamesh epic. Unlike in the Gilgamesh epic, here there is nothing about Gilgamesh rejecting the goddess as a lover (it appears at the beginning of the myth that they already have been lovers), but like in the Gilgamesh epic this myth does show Gilgamesh as having an overweening pride and disrespect for the goddess, which is what gets him into trouble, so this hubris motif is consistent as between the two stories. I don’t think that the Sumerian background generally portrays Inanna (later Ishtar) and Gilgamesh as eternal enemies, which would be unimaginable for this king of Uruk where Inanna had her Eanna temple as tutelary deity of the city he ruled (meaning that as king he may have annually undertaken a sacred marriage ritual with her). In another Sumerian myth known as &lt;em&gt;The Huluppu Tree,&lt;/em&gt; it is Gilgamesh who is Inanna’s hero and benefactor. There he chased a serpent, the Anzu-bird, and Lilith away from Inanna’s sacred tree in her garden after her own brother Utu had ignored her entreaties and refused to do so. Gilgamesh came to her rescue, and then fashioned parts of the tree into gifts for her. It is possible that in the aftermath they became lovers. Thus, I think the cause of their spat in the Gilgamesh epic is particular to this story, which gets us back to what its author was up to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a literary standpoint, I think Gilgamesh’s encounter with Ishtar in the epic should be considered against Enkidu’s earlier sexual encounter with the cult courtesan Shamhat, from whom he gains wisdom and becomes civilized. Gilgamesh, on the other hand, already has this knowledge and a high degree of wisdom when he confronts Ishtar. But here he is too smart and knowledgeable for his own good. So when Ishtar makes her advances, he calls up the litany of her failed relationships with other lovers and says he wants no part of that. But he goes on and on about it in a prideful way and is really insulting to Ishtar, something that a human (or demigod like Gilgamesh) should never do to. This is a display of hubris, which explains the long litany. If he is to refuse, he should at least do so politely and diplomatically, but he did not apply his wisdom here. Further, humans must stay in their proper place in relation to deities and not rise about their station. Thus, Gilgamesh probably should not have refused at all, and acted according to his station in life. Recall that, as king of Uruk, Gilgamesh probably would have been obligated to undertake annually a sacred marriage ceremony with her, in which case his rejection of her would be an improper dereliction of duty in violation of the established cosmic order.  His and Enkidu’s pride brings on the onslaught of the Bull of Heaven, where they display even more hubris, Enkidu by throwing the haunch of the dismembered Bull at Ishtar. This sets up the real punishment. Gilgamesh instead of Enkidu could have perished in response to vanquishing the Bull, but the gods decide that Enkidu should die. Nevertheless, Gilgamesh suffers greatly by reason of Enkidu’s death, which is necessary for the plot because this is what gets him thinking about immortality and sets him off on his quest for that.  In that quest he displays more pride and ambition, but in the end he has to be reconciled with human life and his fate as it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Ishtar too is being portrayed negatively here. From her own behavior (e.g., she does the proposing) and what Gilgamesh describes about her in the litany, it becomes clear that she is acting badly, in fact much like a man, so it is understandable why Gilgamesh rejects her. Contrast this with the story’s favorable portrayals of Shamhat and Siduri, who reflect more traditional feminine profiles favored by the author.  Thus, both Ishtar and Gilgamesh are aspiring to go beyond their proper stations, as a result of which each of their expected roles has become inverted to some extent: Gilgamesh attempting to become divine rather than living as a man, and the goddess acting like a man rather than serving in a more conventional female role. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dalley, Stephanie. &lt;em&gt;Myths from Mesopotamia.&lt;/em&gt; Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1989.

So mounting a chariot driven by Iolaus, he came to Lerna, and having halted his horses, he discovered the hydra on a hill beside the springs of the Amymone, where was its den. By pelting it with fiery shafts he forced it to come out, and in the act of doing so he seized and held it fast. But the hydra wound itself about one of his feet and clung to him. Nor could he effect anything by smashing its heads with his club, for as fast as one head was smashed there grew up two. A huge crab also came to the help of the hydra by biting his foot. So he killed it, and in his turn called for help on Iolaus who, by setting fire to a piece of the neighboring wood and burning the roots of the heads with the brands, prevented them from sprouting. Having thus got the better of the sprouting heads, he chopped off the immortal head, and buried it, and put a heavy rock on it, beside the road that leads through Lerna to Elaeus. But the body of the hydra he slit up and dipped his arrows in the gall.

Was it the Wrath of God? There are myths about this, but the question is specifically asking about the Christian apocalypse which implies source material would have to be in the book of Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we can infer from this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Horsemen were destructive in nature: this goes against the nature of God as defined in the new testament as being a kinder, gentler diety compared to the old testament. Clearly their power must derive from evil, but we do not know their origin. This makes it difficult to measure them against the Devil: i.e. if Satan created them we might know they are strictly lesser in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Horsemen are able to affect earth directly by killing, starving, and infecting men. In verse 4, we learn that War is able to cause men to fight each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do we know about the Devil?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is one of God's archangels, fallen from heaven. He clearly must be powerful, and evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous times throughout the Bible, we see the Devil act. However, he never actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; anything. His power is that of suggestion and temptation. In Genesis he tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, so she will cause the fall of man from grace. In the Gospels he tempts Jesus multiple times, but is unable to sway him or to harm him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usccb.org/bible/genesis/3&quot;&gt;Genesis 3&lt;/a&gt; shows the snake is &quot;cunning&quot; and tricks Eve:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;1: Now the snake was the most cunning of all the wild animals that the&#xA;  LORD God had made. He asked the woman, &quot;Did God really say, 'You shall&#xA;  not eat from any of the trees in the garden'?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;13: The LORD God then asked the woman: What is this you have done? The&#xA;  woman answered, &quot;The snake tricked me, so I ate it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This great deceiver, the serpent, is later identified to be the Devil in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usccb.org/bible/rev/12:09&quot;&gt;Revelation 12:9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The huge dragon, the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and&#xA;  Satan, who deceived the whole world, was thrown down to earth, and its&#xA;  angels were thrown down with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Devil persuades Eve to commit the original sin without actually doing anything other than talking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usccb.org/bible/matthew/4&quot;&gt;Matthew 4&lt;/a&gt;, we see the Devil tempt Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;1: Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by&#xA;  the devil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;3: The tempter approached and said to him, &quot;If you are the Son of God,&#xA;  command that these stones become loaves of bread.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;5-6: Then the devil took him to the holy city, and made him stand on&#xA;  the parapet of the temple, 6and said to him, &quot;If you are the Son of&#xA;  God, throw yourself down...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;8-9: Then the devil took him up to a very high mountain, and showed&#xA;  him all the kingdoms of the world in their magnificence, and he said&#xA;  to him, &quot;All these I shall give to you, if you will prostrate yourself&#xA;  and worship me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;10: At this, Jesus said to him, &quot;Get away, Satan! ...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jesus specifically identifies the tempter as Satan, the Devil. All he can do is suggest to Jesus that he do certain things: he did not &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; Jesus turn rocks into bread, or jump off a roof safely. His power is clearly that of suggestion and temptation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given what we know, how do they compare?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we measure known quantities about where they came from, the Devil is likely more powerful. He is a fallen archangel, one of God's lieutenants. We know almost nothing (in scripture) about the origin of the Horsemen: this implies they are not major players in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we measure what they are capable of actually doing, the Horsemen are likely more powerful. They can directly impact earth, killing people either directly via sword, famine or disease, or by causing mayhem wherein men kill each other. The Devil can merely suggest that men cause themselves to fall from grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="686" LastEditorUserId="686" LastEditDate="2015-09-01T00:34:57.403" LastActivityDate="2015-09-01T00:34:57.403" CommentCount="3" />

His body (even before Odin, Vili, and Ve killed him) was the source from which the materials to make the world and life came. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/pre/pre04.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gylfaginning&lt;/a&gt;) It's a potentially subtle (on the surface), but rather important difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world is &lt;em&gt;freaking huge&lt;/em&gt;. Trees, left to grow for a few hundred years, can grow several feet in diameter and a couple hundred feet tall. The sea, even when out on it, stretches as far as the eye can see, and the sky was untraversible entirely. The planet, itself, is so huge that even modern humans have a hard time wrapping their head around the concept of its size (yes, we can measure it and can cite the distance of its circumference or diameter, but it's still difficult to fully understand what that size actually &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We create things all the time, so someone had to create the world, right? We create things larger than us (houses, boats, etc), but generally require materials to also be larger than us (namely, trees), even if the materials aren't as large as the final thing, or if we use different parts of the source material for different purposes. So, the gods would have had to have a source from which to create things, since they were the creators. That's the hypothetical idea, anyway (unfortunately, it's impossible to know why ancient people created the stories the way they did, we can only interpret the information we do have, find patterns and whatnot, and form hypotheses).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's hypothesized by some scholars -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borr#Theories_and_interpretations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;namely Finnur Magnússon&lt;/a&gt;* -- that Odin, Vili, Ve (and, for that matter, their parents, Borr and Bestla), as well as Ymir, in the myth are representations of the primal forces of nature. Additionally, many parts of the natural world are, in other nordic myths, created/handled by Jotunar, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; Jotunar, or handled by descendants of Jotunar, lending them again to the role of the primal/primeval forces. The stories, then, are a way of understanding forces that otherwise seem completely random, nonsensical, or otherwise mystifying (in Norse lore, this continues on beyond the creation myth, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe03.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the sun and moon as beings&lt;/a&gt; unto themselves, complete with parentage).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*(Using this link, because it seems and English version of &lt;em&gt;Lexicon Mythologicum&lt;/em&gt; is not readily available online. &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8RBAAAAcAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA1&amp;amp;lpg=PA1&amp;amp;dq=Lexicon%20Mythologicum%20Finnur%20Magn%C3%BAsson&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=ljG-yy8v9w&amp;amp;sig=cd14ooRYD4wfImoFR4-TjgYzf7Y&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBGoVChMIzL_1yuzVxwIViowNCh0waQPu#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here's the original-language version for those interested.&lt;/a&gt; If someone knows of an English version, I'll be happy to link it.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="705" LastEditorUserId="705" LastEditDate="2015-09-01T12:53:01.260" LastActivityDate="2015-09-01T12:53:01.260" CommentCount="3" />

While not sacrificed, he was slain and is said to be reborn after Ragnarok. Often being associated with light and purity, he is very often drawn as a Christ parallel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/pre/pre04.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gylfaginning&lt;/em&gt; has this to say of Baldr&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The second son of Odin is Baldur, and good things are to be said of him. He is best, and all praise him; he is so fair of feature, and so bright, that light shines from him. A certain herb is so white that it is likened to Baldr's brow; of all grasses it is whitest, and by it thou mayest judge his fairness, both in hair and in body. He is the wisest of the Æsir, and the fairest-spoken and most gracious; and that quality attends him, that none may gainsay his judgments. He dwells in the place called Breidablik, which is in heaven; in that place may nothing unclean be[.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What little remains about Baldr suggests that the events surrounding his death and rebirth happen in places other than Midgard (presumably in Asgard, though time and Christian influence has changed it to &quot;heaven&quot; in the texts).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second, as less obvious parallel is Odin's sacrifices for wisdom and the runes. The biggest difference here is that Odin did not sacrifice his life, but other things. His eye to Mimir's well for wisdom, for one. The sacrifice for obtaining the runes is more complex, but still applicable in its parallels, I think:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I know that I hung on a wind-rocked tree,&#xA;  nine whole nights,&#xA;  with a spear wounded, and to Odin offered,&#xA;  myself to myself;&#xA;  on that tree, of which no one knows&#xA;  from what root it springs.&#xA;  Bread no one gave me, nor a horn of drink,&#xA;  downward I peered,&#xA;  to runes applied myself, wailing learnt them,&#xA;  then fell down thence&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/havamal.html#runes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Havamal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both events took place in locations other than Midgard, and the sacrifice on the tree has a number of parallels to Jesus' crucifixion (spear wound in the side, lack of food and water, hanging from a tree or wood).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to say that the Germanic mythology influenced the Christian one, or the other way around, it's pretty clear that there is precedent of sacrificial cycles occurring in a non-Earth realm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But These Were Recorded In The 12th Century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They weren't &lt;em&gt;written down&lt;/em&gt; until 12th century, true, but the Germanic tribes were a strong oral culture, not unlike the Jews were before the books of the Bible were written down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how would the Jews and the Germanic people interact? Simply put, via the Romans, and through their own trade and travel routes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Romans were spread far and wide. The Roman Empire, itself, spread into what is now Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the entire northern coast of Africa. Combine that with the Silk Road trade route, and they were mixing cultural aspects from as far east as China with that of the Gauls from England. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Romans and Germanics were not strangers, by any stretch, and the Germanic tribes were well-documented by the Romans, including Julius Cesaer and Senator Tacitus. Tacitus even illustrates in &lt;em&gt;Germania&lt;/em&gt; that several of the southernmost Germanic tribes were part of the Roman Empire (and the Roman Republic before it), &lt;a href=&quot;https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~wstevens/history331texts/barbarians.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;among other details&lt;/a&gt; about them. Additionally, the Roman army under Gaius Marius captured some 20,000 Teutons at their final defeat in France in 100BC in the Cimbrian War, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.no/books?id=j3LowhKACVwC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=marius%20war%20spartacus&amp;amp;hl=no&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=mjS4UOvqI46k4ASo3oDoBQ#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=marius%20german&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;many of which went on to fight in the Third Servile War.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Romans, even long before the Empire, were equal-opportunity slavers, bringing slaves in from all corners of their reach. Furthermore, the Romans &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; mixed ethnic groups as a means of preventing solidarity, because they were fully aware of both the tensions between the non-Roman tribes and the ramifications of the slaves forming an army (particularly when headed by trained and tested gladiators). Combined with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12816-rome#1005&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia's attestation&lt;/a&gt; that the Jews had been in Rome since at least as early as the 100s BCE, it makes at least some contact between the Germanics and the Jews rather likely. Start combining stories of Baldr and Forseti with those of Jesus, and you start seeing both the Earthly Jesus story (Forseti's &quot;12+1&quot; motif) and the Heavenly Jesus sacrifice/resurrection (Baldr's sacrifice/resurrection motif). With the propensity of Earthly sacrificial gods, though (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liberalamerica.org/2015/03/17/5-near-identical-jesus-christ-myths-that-predate-jesus/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Horus, Mithra, Osiris, etc.&lt;/a&gt;), it's easy to see why the Earthly Jesus story won out in the canon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the northern Europeans traveled extensively on their own. Recent findings have shown that they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenational.ae/world/europe/when-the-arabs-met-the-vikings-new-discovery-suggests-ancient-links#full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;had direct contact with the Arabian nations&lt;/a&gt;. This particular contact was a later dating, but says that the Germanic people were no stranger to the Arabians. Interestingly, while the Germanics' hostile movements were more westward, toward France and Spain, the known contacts with Arabian people were largely peaceful -- missions of trade instead of invasion (possibly for metals of various sorts, including silver and iron, due to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guillaume_Bertrand2/publication/259706418_Main_mineral_deposits_of_Europe/links/0a85e52d69fda26cd3000000&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the relative scarcity of such minerals in the northern parts of Germania&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Early Influence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think most notably, the Canaanites' religion -- specifically Ba'al -- had some of the heaviest influence with regard to a death/resurrection deity. Hell, Ba'al is mentioned in several passages of the Bible, itself, as basically an example of &quot;who not to worship,&quot; and the Bible goes to great lengths to make Ba'al out to be supremely evil. This (along with various other knowledge of the fluidity of religion around that time) suggests to me that worship or otherwise acknowledgement of Ba'al may have had more influence than a Greek or Roman counterpart (which, it seems, the Jews actively resisted as they resisted assimilation into the Roman culture in general). The story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2016&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ahab in 1 Kings&lt;/a&gt; is a prime example of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pantheon.org/articles/b/baal.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ba'al is attested&lt;/a&gt; to be the son of another deity (usually attested as El, though Dagon is a close contender), though is the principal god of the Canaanites. He basically represented life in pretty much all its aspects -- fertility, rain, the sun, the cycle of the year. He, himself, died and was reborn every year (presumably in the Canaanites' version of heaven or non-earthly plane).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Christianity Doesn't Have That Kind Of Cyclical Nature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking that the cyclical nature rules them out as influences on the Jesus story. I disagree. For one, Jedeo-Christianity does actually have a cyclical nature to it, it just happens that the cycles tend to be quite a bit longer -- in multiples of 7. The most common, of course, is the week, but year-length ones exist, too. Every 7th year is a sabbatical year, every 7th sabbatical year (well, technically, the year after, since that year is the sabbatical, and like the Sabbath day, it's pretty much required to rest, so every 50th year; at least, that's how I understand it, but I'm not a Jewish scholar) is a Jubilee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lengths of these cycles seem to hold up with Judeo-Christian lore, as they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.1260-1290-days-bible-prophecy.org/Jubilee-missing-Sabbaths.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seem to line up with times of prosperity or distress among the Israelites or prominent Biblical figures&lt;/a&gt;, though often on timelines of several centuries (basically, they faced Jehovah's wrath if they missed too many Sabbatical years, or worse, too many Jubilees). In the case of Jeremiah, it was a 70 year punishment after 490 years of the Israelites not obeying the Sabbath years. It was also not uncommon for punishments to be laid out over the course of a generation or more (the Israelites lost in the desert for 40 years, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the prophecy of Daniel about the rebuilding of Jerusalem is 1000 years in length, as is the reign of Jesus after the Second Coming and Tribulation period, further lending to very long cycle lengths. In other words, it's not that there's no cycle, it's just that the cycles in Judeo-Christianity are &lt;em&gt;really long&lt;/em&gt;, so we only see information about a couple completed regarding Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, detailed data gets pretty scarce pretty quickly once you start getting into Pre-Roman and Proto-European stuff, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/IndoEuropeanTreeDielli1.svg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tracing the Proto-Indo-European language tree&lt;/a&gt; suggests common ancestry at some point, so it's possible the myths you're looking for also trace back to the Proto- time, forming before the clearer deliniations of peoples. That's beyond the scope of this answer at this point, and would probably require quite a bit deeper digging than I have the resources to do, if there's data on that at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="705" LastEditorUserId="705" LastEditDate="2015-09-11T15:26:31.083" LastActivityDate="2015-09-11T15:26:31.083" CommentCount="9" />

In Cambodian Mythology, they believe the Khmer People to have been born out of union of Indian and Nagas or Serpents. For Hindus it represents rebirth due to the casting off of it's skin and being 'reborn'. Search for Nāgas for more Hindu myths, they feature prominently in several myths. Koreans fear the snake and worship it as a god. In Mesoamerica we have Quetzalcoatl who was a 'feathered serpent' patron of arts, crafts and merchants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why is this? To answer that question, I'm going to take a look at the epic of Gilgamesh, which is from a similar region as the bible.

The snake then becomes immortal, as snakes can &quot;shed their skin&quot; and thus be reborn. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not trying to suggest that Gilgamesh is a precursor to the bible, or that Gilgamesh represents every other myth that features serpents, but it is illuminating as an example of how other cultures viewed serpents. It's clear from the epic of Gilgamesh that snakes are strongly associated with rebirth, immortality, and life.

Remember that Grendel is a coward (he attacks at night, etc.), and would want to avoid a fight with Beowolf if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, when Grendel enters the hall, he get's extremely excited when he sees the armed warriors sleeping there, and decides to eat them all up.

The use of weapons by Beowolf's companions serves as a contrast between them and Beowolf himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I'm basing my interpretations solely on the text because I don't have time to research how critics or academics interpret this scene.

Once something gets into the popular imagination, it's difficult to leave. Just look at the featherless, fatless dinosaurs in Jurassic World.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the visual aspect, &quot;Pandora's box&quot; has now become a saying, and saying's are notoriously difficult to change, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=Lev7YeUk7H0C&amp;amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;even when wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, though, the type of jar mentioned, a &lt;em&gt;pithos&lt;/em&gt;, is meant for storage, and is often plugged up with cork and wax. However, the action of snapping the lid quickly doesn't exist for a pithos, so when recalling the memory of the story, the vivid actions tend to override the more inconsequential details, leaving the incorrect details in the retelling.

According to the standard interpretation, the cedar forests refer to the famous cedar forests of Lebanon and Syria, which were highly sought after by kings as far back as Sargon. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad&quot;&gt;Sargon of Akkad&lt;/a&gt;, based in Akkad in now northern Iraq, would boast of his conquests of the far reaches of Mesopotamia, including the cedar forests:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;He made them cross the Amanus; he made his troops cross the Amanus. He reached the cedar forest. Amidst its din(?) he bowed down and readied his weapons. He offered a sacrifice, made obeisance, spoke distinctly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&quot;Sargon in Foreign Lands,&quot; vv. 11'-14')&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were not many forests with in either Mesopotamia or Egypt with the quality of wood you could find in Syria and the Levant, so timber from the region was extremely important. The acquisition of a source of cheap timber would most certainly be connected with issues of imperial expansion, and it's no surprise that both Pharaonic Egypt and Mesopotamia as early as Sargon of Akkad both desired control over the region.&lt;a href=&quot;http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm1997b.pdf&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; (warning: PDF)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This particular text comes from an epic of Sargon, although the fragmentary nature of it makes it difficult to know the full extent of the composition. What we do know is that there are many parallels with the Gilgamesh story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sargonid dynasty (ca. 2300-2150) was the first real empire (now often called the Akkadian empire), and Sargon and his descendants' rule, though they were of a Semitic-speaking people (usually called Assyrian or Babylonian based off the primacy of those two cities in latter times), included all of Sumer, a different people with a different language. After its collapse, the city of Ur took over the empire (although lacked its far reaches), which is now known as the Ur III dynasty. Ur was not a Semitic city, but a Sumerian one, and so naturally there was some tension in recognizing Sargon's deeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the results of this tension appears to be the ascription of deeds of Sargon to Gilgamesh. Since Sargon went to Dilmun, Gilgamesh went to Dilmun; since Sargon conquered the area containing cedar forests, so too did Gilgamesh go to the Cedar Forest and defeat Humbaba.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The precise relationship between the two is hypothetical. One hypothesis is that the journey to Cedar Forests was only created in the Ur III period. The epic would act as a counter of sorts to the Akkadian propaganda that preceded it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative, one favored by Tigay (p. 78), is that there was always a journey to the Cedar Forest, but only with the Akkadian period did it acquire a precise location corresponding with Sargon's military activity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hansman 1976. &quot;Gilgamesh, Humbaba and the Land of the Erin-Trees.&quot; &lt;em&gt;Iraq&lt;/em&gt; 38.1: 23–35.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Horowitz 1988. &lt;em&gt;Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography&lt;/em&gt;.

This is likely because Kronos 'begat' the Olympian generation, and therefore was the 'seed'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saying the Greeks viewed Kronos as evil is something of a simplification, and it's important to recognize it as such because the difference in Greek and Roman religious worldviews goes to the heart of your question. For the Greeks, the gods showed supernatural virtue &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; supernatural vice. As can be deduced from his name, Kronos was originally an agricultural deity and the connection of seeds to planting and harvesting crops led to an association with seasons. Kronos wasn't necessarily &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt;, it rather might be more diplomatic to say that because he feared one of his children would overthrow him (a well-founded fear, it turns out) he was doing 'what he had to do' by eating them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saturn's etymology is a bit trickier, but is probably PIE * &lt;em&gt;sewH(r)-&lt;/em&gt; which would have meant 'seed, bring forth' and is cognate with modern English seed, son, semen, serum, sow (meaning what you do with seeds in a field). This means Saturn for the oldest of the Romans had an agricultural character (like Kronos for the Greeks) and it is apparent the two entities come from a single concept in an earlier PIE society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big difference is for the Romans the gods were paragons of virtue &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; vice. They were individuals much more to be beheld from afar with a sense of fear or awe; the Greek gods were extraordinarily relatable by comparison. The Roman association of agrarian wealth with Saturn was therefore the chief issue for &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, while the conflict between himself and Jupiter was a matter amongst the gods. The Greeks didn't view the behavior of Kronos and Zeus quite so distantly but rather as a plausible human circumstance, and therefore may have been more reluctant to worship not only someone who ate his children, but who &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; the war that came after. All fathers worry that their sons will outgrow and eventually overpower them, and the Titanomachy is a mythical reflection of this universal human process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="743" LastActivityDate="2015-10-17T15:31:58.973" CommentCount="5" />

Weimer's answer, so in lieu of that I will expand upon something he said and add a point of my own in the hopes that it's good enough to qualify as a new answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote Mr. Weimer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Others have noted that it may preserve a tradition of backlash against the introduction of agriculture in the region. Abel's offerings would be the offerings of a semi-nomadic shepherd, while Cain's is indicative of a farmer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is what I've always believed. I was first exposed to this idea in a physical anthropology class in my freshman year, but I didn't register it until reading &lt;em&gt;Ishmael&lt;/em&gt; by Daniel Quinn. Abel represents pastoralism and Cain is what Quinn calls &lt;em&gt;totalitarian agriculture&lt;/em&gt;. Note that after being forced to wander, Cain went on to produce children like Enoch and Tubal-Cain who created astronomy, writing, architecture and metalworking. In this way, all of the traditions and practices we would commonly associate with civilization result from agriculture and ultimately from Cain. I think we can see parallels of the theme that conflict involving brothers leads to the beginning of civilization in the Proto-Indo-European divine hero twins * &lt;em&gt;manu-&lt;/em&gt; (man) and * &lt;em&gt;yemo-&lt;/em&gt; (twin) cf. Lat. &lt;em&gt;Gemini&lt;/em&gt;, Skr. &lt;em&gt;Yama&lt;/em&gt;. Like Romulus and Remus, Cain and Abel, or Ymir in Germanic myths - who was vivisected to constitute the world, the two brothers come to some critical moment and on the death of the twin the survivor (the elder brother) - or his progeny - goes on to found advanced societies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'd like to suggest an uncommon and somewhat apologist reading of the text in Genesis 4 whereby Cain is obeying God by killing Abel because the act essentially amounts to a sacrifice. The Lord looked favorably on Abel for his offering but unfavorably on Cain for his own. The Lord then tells Cain 'Do not just be angry. Do what is right (make an appropriate offering) and you(r sacrifice) will be accepted.' In Cain going on to sacrifice his brother, the 'sweetest of his bounty', I would argue we are seeing an early iteration of later stories, for example Abraham being asked to sacrifice his son, whereby the Lord is only satiated with the blood of his servants' beloveds. Looked at this way, Cain is the first killer but not the first &lt;em&gt;murderer&lt;/em&gt;, and a conflicted character whose adherence to duty drives his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="743" LastActivityDate="2015-10-17T19:46:56.783" CommentCount="3" />

There are, of course, the famous examples of Odin and Balder in Scandinavian mythology. Some would say that the Odin myth shows Christian influence, but that's begging the question: it starts with the assumption that the Scandinavians could not have their own indigenous dying-and-rising-god myth and argues from there that the myth must be influenced by Christianity. Such arguments are not very convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example that hardly anyone ever brings up is the Hindu god Ganesha. Shiva actually cuts off his head, killing him, and then, when faced with an irate Parvati, Shiva's wife and Ganesha's mother, he replaces the severed head with an elephant's and brings Ganesha back to life. That is a clear-cut case of dying-and-rising god if ever there was one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no, &quot;dying-and-rising gods&quot; are not dead, not by a long shot, and in fact are not as geographically limited as commonly supposed.

He wrote long after conversion, and his work was likely affected by the fogging of the lens caused by time and the shift in beliefs caused by the arrival of Christianity. In addition, Snorri's Iceland was far removed from Scandinavia, so anything that one might say about Iceland might not apply to Norway, Denmark, or Sweden, regardless of the period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classifying supernatural beings is always problematic since it depends on the fluid testimonies of informants who might not agree with one another and whose observations can change from time to time.

The  CALLEBURNE was a the lightning-struck sword in the stone.  Until it had been hit by lightning and basically re-forged by the intense heat and electrical current, it was a cheap, plain iron sword.  The moss, rust, and scale had built up on it for years and the bolt from the blue added in some new minerals from the moldstone and coke/charcoal from the lichens growing there: re-making it to fine steel.  Some even say that it was one Merlin's early attempt at sword smithing and that he had abandoned the mold as the sprue of steel had run throughout his mold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something like this:&quot;Mother nature split the rock from way on high and broke away the Sword from the sprues and the lichen, slime, rust, other bits of dead corruption, and the living vines that had over-grown the mold that had become a Stone (in appearance anyway.) The pelting rain that follows the fireworks quenched the nearly molten steel. And perhaps the celestial arch even rendered lodestone (magnetized) of the blade in the process. As the Ore around the now-separated blade remained energized for hours after the jolt, the Field of current at the precipice of that hill would align every sliver of iron as it cooled with the very energy of all the metals deeply within the earth...  What had been Merlin's last failure as a Blacksmith and a beginning Alchemist had been corrected by the powers of the earth itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is apparent to all that knew; Merlin had never actually been wrong, merely a sign of the impatience of his long-forgotten youth... as he could have certainly re-forged the weapon after that first casting went side-wrong.  He simple moved on to his next pyromancing adventure and experiments with new and better alloys of metal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I remember reading it...  It had to be over 30-35 years ago.  It seems to me that it was a collection of Irish Folk tales. Though it may as well have been more generically Gaelic tales that were a combination Welsh, Scottish, Norwegian, Belgian, Bretton, or Burgandy French. It was definitely translated/adapted from a non-english European language tale about the British Isles and a Wizard/Druid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was told from the POV of one of Merlin's relatives or at least a Druidic practical follower of the old ways of magic and enlightenment.  +I'll continue.This great sword was stolen from the corrupt regime of Arthur as he grew lax in the enforcement of his codes.  It was sold and cut into two separate swords by an opportunistic blacksmith that could make two fantastic single-sided blades from the double-edged Great Sword wonder.  These monstrosities were returned to Merlin, who re-forged them again back to a whole blade as one of his last acts for King Arthur.  To quench the sword, Merlin flung it into the edge of a lake that was drained by a powerful river; while the tip and edge of the new blade was white-hot.  It sang and shrieked as it flew through the night air. (at this point it is supposed that the location of the river is not in England, but Africa. What would later be Lake Victoria, Victoria Falls and a branch of the Nile. The pieces of Calleberne were found by Merlin on a quest of his own, only tangentially related to anything Arthurian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He retrieved the pieces from the deserts of Arabia, and borrowed a kiln from an Alchemist in the area to re-forge the pieces into what would become Excalibur. Again: Forged by Merlin; perfected and blessed by nature...Then left to be claimed by Arthur, if he was noble enough.)  To retrieve the new sword Arthur would have to make peace with nature and pray to the water sprites that guarded that part of the world.   Then the Lady of the Lake would reveal its location at a bend of the river in a shallow pool, where it had been deposited within the night of it's re-forging.  All that had to happen was for the Queen of Water Nymphs to remove the fog from the King's eyes. He had been fighting in a Crusade and perhaps looking for the Holy Grail. Generally, just lost.  Merlin hoped to give him the path to settle his spirit and the tools to get back to being a decent human again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How I remember bits and pieces of the story that connect the legends of two swords.  One sword that became two and then was made into yet another.More importantly, the connections and emotions that intertwine the lives of men and women with each other and the world around them are explored in a hopeful, romantic, and mystical tale.

Evelyn-White's hypothesis is that the authors of the non Homeric poems were reasonably aware of Homer's works. This is summarized in the introduction of &lt;em&gt;Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trojan Cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Six epics with the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot; made up the Trojan Cycle—The &quot;Cyprian Lays&quot;, the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Aethiopis&quot;, the &quot;Little Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Sack of Troy&quot;, the &quot;Returns&quot;, the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and the &quot;Telegony&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It has been assumed in the foregoing pages that the poems of the Trojan Cycle are later than the Homeric poems; but, as the opposite view has been held, the reasons for this assumption must now be given. 1) Tradition puts Homer and the Homeric poems proper back in the ages before chronological history began, and at the same time assigns the purely Cyclic poems to definite authors who are dated from the first Olympiad (776 B.C.) downwards. This tradition cannot be purely arbitrary. 2) The Cyclic poets (as we can see from the abstract of Proclus) were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by Homer. Thus, when we find that in the &quot;Returns&quot; all the prominent Greek heroes except Odysseus are accounted for, we are forced to believe that the author of this poem knew the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and judged it unnecessary to deal in full with that hero's adventures. In a word, the Cyclic poems are 'written round' the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. 3) The general structure of these epics is clearly imitative. As M.M. Croiset remark, the abusive Thersites in the &quot;Aethiopis&quot; is clearly copied from the Thersites of the &quot;Iliad&quot;; in the same poem Antilochus, slain by Memnon and avenged by Achilles, is obviously modelled on Patroclus. 4) The geographical knowledge of a poem like the &quot;Returns&quot; is far wider and more precise than that of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. 5) Moreover, in the Cyclic poems epic is clearly degenerating morally—if the expression may be used. The chief greatness of the &quot;Iliad&quot; is in the character of the heroes Achilles and Hector rather than in the actual events which take place: in the Cyclic writers facts rather than character are the objects of interest, and events are so packed together as to leave no space for any exhibition of the play of moral forces. All these reasons justify the view that the poems with which we now have to deal were later than the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and if we must recognize the possibility of some conventionality in the received dating, we may feel confident that it is at least approximately just.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/348/348-h/348-h.htm#link2H_4_0012&quot;&gt;The Project Gutenberg EBook of Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica, by Homer and Hesiod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe this remains the prevalent theory, although the matter is far from settled.

And again she bore a third, the evil-minded Hydra of Lerna, whom the goddess, white-armed Hera nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty Heracles. And her Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver. She was the mother of Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth a fearful blast of blazing fire. Her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon slay; but Echidna was subject in love to Orthus and brought forth the deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans, and the Nemean lion, which Hera, the good wife of Zeus, brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea, a plague to men.

That is, before the Greeks were literate and the epics were written down, they existed in more fluid oral versions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Proficient rhapsodes knew and could manipulate the oral traditions.  By that I mean that they could 'stitch together' various components of the epic cycle as they or their audience wanted. Homer was aware of the pre-existing oral traditions;  the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; itself was an oral composition. The later authors knew the traditions, as well, since some orality survived to Plato's time at least. (The transition from orality to literacy, called proto-literacy, involves both systems of transmission coexisting side by side -- a period that lasted about 400 years for the Greeks.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as the rhapsodes enjoyed latitude in the oral performance of lays from the epic cycle, so too the first writers of the epics admitted many influences and innovations.

Yet professional folklorists  have said very little about the huge corpus of Campbelliana.  I do not know if  any  of his many books were ever even reviewed in JAF.  Is this a case of &quot;silence gives assent&quot;?  Very likely more people were introduced  to the  subject  matter of folklore by  the writings  of  Campbell or the PBS television series of lectures by  him than by any  other source. And yet we folklorists have said little or nothing about him and his theories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dundes makes a number of criticisms of Joseph Campbell. One of these is of his assumption that myths are universal, which, as Dundes quickly proves, is not the case. To quote from Dundes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It has  long  been a  popular fantasy among  amateur students of  myth  that all peoples share the same stories. This is  clearly  an  example  of wishful thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples of myths that Joseph Campbell claims to be universal but which are not are include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The flood myth, which is &quot;absent from sub-Saharan Africa&quot; (Dundes).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &quot;virgin-birth&quot; motif, which is only present in three separate myths, and is absent from &quot;Africa... Siberia, Polynesia, ... Melanesia, ... Australia and New  Guinea&quot; (Dundes).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &quot;belly of the whale&quot; motif: this &quot;motif&quot; is only present in the old testament (Dundes). The only other example Campbell cites of a &quot;belly of the wale&quot; motif -- the story of Red Riding Hood -- is a horrible example. Red Riding Hood is only swallowed by a wolf in the written version of the story; in the oral version of the story &quot;the  girl  is not swallowed by  the wolf at all... Instead she  escapes through  a clever ruse  by pretending to need to go  outside to defecate&quot; (Dundes).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it would be safe to say that Joseph Campbell's arguments that the monomyth is &quot;universal&quot; aren't very sound. If you are interested in reading more, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/4137664&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dundes' article is available on JSTOR&lt;/a&gt;, which you can usually access for free from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldcat.org/libraries&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;public library&lt;/a&gt;. Dundes has other criticisms of of Campbell, but they aren't relevant to the question asked by the OP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also recently wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://taxicrash.github.io/monomyth-incorrect-dangerous/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog post about Joseph Campbell that might interest you&lt;/a&gt;.

Such as what data pieces / fields would be generic enough to be important for all deities yet not be majorly unused on the majority of the entries (and it needs to capture those deities who have different names among different cultures). I've read and own multiple books that cover this topic and they each tend to be primarily author-myopic, focusing on the mythologies / religions that the author considered most important while ignoring the countless other deities worshipped by groups of people.

I want to use this website / database for a set of specific purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Public Domain. Almost every site out there that tracks deities has these disclaimers that stop you from referencing their entries on the deities without some serious contractual agreements, others just say no.

In order to do this, the structure needs to be Open Graph ready. That's part of my goal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fields. By 'field' I am trying to convey that I am looking for metadata properties, descriptors, etc. that are generic-enough to fit for most deities (and deity-like entities).

Don't be locked into &quot;text field&quot; concepts. I can offer multiple choice selections. That way, when entering Dionysus I could enter under DISCIPLINE several entries such as 'grape harvest', 'winemaking', 'wine', 'ritual madness', 'fertility', 'theatre' and 'religious ecstasy'.

Hades kidnapped Persephone and took her to the Underworld to be his wife. Persephone’s mother, Demeter, goddess of fertility, considering her daughter lost, went into mourning and thus all things on earth ceased to grow. Zeus, Persephone’s father, commanded his brother Hades to release her, however Hades had tricked her into eating six pomegranate seeds, and it was the rule of the Fates that anyone who consumed food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Since Persephone had eaten the six pomegranate seeds,  she had to remain in the Underworld for six months of the year. Hades agreed to release her to the world above for the other six months of the year, to be reunited with her mother. This is how the ancient Greeks explained the cycle of the seasons: when Persephone was with her mother, the earth flourished and the crops grew (Spring and Summer); when she returned to Hades, Demeter mourned and the earth was infertile (Autumn and Winter). As a consequence, pomegranates were often offered to the goddess Demeter in prayer for fertile land.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you TLDRed it, then basically, the myth of Persephone and Hades ties in because offerings were brought to Demeter in the sign of a Pomegranate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="967" LastEditorUserId="57" LastEditDate="2016-01-07T14:37:37.363" LastActivityDate="2016-01-07T14:37:37.363" CommentCount="5" />

Is this why its called 'myth'os since its basically a story? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're essentially asking: how does the academic process work? The answer is: academic experts in anything will &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cite their sources when they make claims (which makes it easy to evaluate whether their claims are accurate)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Give their work to other experts, who will evaluate their work based on its accuracy (this is called peer review).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have read a huge amount of the literature related to their subject. All of the people who I would consider an academic expert have literally read hundreds of books on the subjects they teach/write about.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These three things make it much more likely for something that an academic says to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could also seek out non-academic experts, i.e. people who have been doing [thing x] for a long period of time and thus know a lot about it. This is hard to do with Greek mythology, but should be easy to do with something like Buddhism; I personally know several people who I would consider experts in Buddhism because they practice it every day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for accuracy/truth: seek out experts, and experts are much more likely to be found in the real world, not the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2016-01-08T17:58:23.013" CommentCount="1" />

It makes sense then that with Gaia (&lt;em&gt;gaia&lt;/em&gt; means earth) many beings would come forth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, take a look at what exactly is being produced. Hesiod says that the blood created the Seasons, Erinyes, and the Giants, but not Aphrodite, who instead was created when his testicles fell into the sea. That's just Hesiod playing with names, since the Greek word for sea foam was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Aphrodite&quot;&gt;aphros&lt;/a&gt;. The seasons, on the other hand, are naturally created in combination with powers of the sky (or so it would seem to pre-science man) and the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Erinyes' play a role in &quot;avenging the natural order&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Erinyes.html&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, which included tormenting those who commit parricide (i.e. killing your father). It makes then to locate their origin in the very first act of a son cutting down a father.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it should be noted well that Ouranos is not dead. Ouranos is an immortal, and no Greek god can die.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are parallels in other traditions. One that comes to mind is the body of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagu-tsuchi&quot;&gt;Kagutsuchi&lt;/a&gt;, who came out of his mother in a ball of fire, burning her to death. As punishment, the &lt;em&gt;kami&lt;/em&gt; (Japanese gods) cut up his body into eight pieces: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;which became eight volcanoes.

(Hom. Od. xi. 324.) The words added in the Odyssey, Dionusou marturiêisin, are difficult to understand, unless we interpret them with Pherecydes by &quot;on the denunciation of Dionysus,&quot; because he was indignant at the profanation of his grotto by the love of Theseus and Ariadne.

According to this tradition, Ariadne put an end to her own life in despair, or was saved by Dionysus, who in amazement at her beauty made her his wife, raised her among the immortals, and placed the crown which he gave her at his marriage with her, among the stars.

Subject to reproduction and birth but exempt from death, the gods worshipped by the Greeks are imperishable but not eternal, unlike the Judaeo-Christian creator god or the supreme being of later Platonists. Differently put, Greek gods have a beginning but no end. Hesiod explains their origins in his &lt;em&gt;Theogony&lt;/em&gt;, which embeds the concept of the divine generation in its title. Gods who suffer and die, such as Dionysus Zagreus, are rare exceptions to the Homeric rule that immortality defined as exemption from death is a prerequisite for divinity.

Wikipedia preserves a summary:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Kundalakesi is an adaptation of the story of the Buddhist Bhikṣuni (lit. female monk) Kunḍalakeśi from the Dhammapada. The protagonist Kundalakesi (lit. The woman with curls) was born in a merchant family in the city of Puhar. Her birth name is &quot;Bhadra&quot;. She loses her mother during childhood and lives a sheltered life. One day she sees a thief being paraded in the streets of Puhar and falls in love with him. The thief, Kaalan has been sentenced to death for banditry. Besotted with Kaalan, Kundalakesi implores her father to save him. Her father petitions the king for the thief's release. He pays Kaalan's weight in gold and 81 elephants to the treasury to secure Kaalan's release. Kundalakesi and Kaalan are married and live happily for some time. One day, she playfully refers to him as a thief. This enrages the mercurial Kaalan and he decides to kill his wife in revenge. He tricks her into visiting the summit of the nearby hill. Once they reach the summit, he announces his intention to kill her by pushing her off the hill. Kundalakesi is shocked and asks him to grant a final wish – she wishes to worship him by going around him three times before she dies. He agrees and when she gets behind him, Kundalakesi pushes him off the summit, killing him. Repenting her actions, she becomes a Buddhist monk and spends the rest of her life spreading the teachings of Buddha. She carries out theological battles with Jains and Hindus, defeating them in debates. She finally attains superior liberation. In one of the versions, it is believed that she was a Jain in her initial life and she shattered conventions by becoming a nigrantha or naked monk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalakesi&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalakesi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neelakesi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was written in response to the Kundalakesi. Instead of a Buddhist nun, it tells the story of&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;the Jain nun [Neelakesi] who was a rival of the Buddhist protagonist of the Kundalakesi. According to the epic, when animal sacrifices of a temple of the Kali in Panchala were stopped due to the influence of the Jains, the Goddess dispatched the local deity Nīli to seduce and destroy the monk responsible for it. However, Nīli herself is converted to Jainism by the monk. Nīlakēci, as she is renamed, travels the country indulging in philosophical debate with rhetoricians of other religions. She debates and defeats several Buddhist rhetoricians like Arkachandra, Kundalakesi, Moggallana (Tamil: Mokkala) and even Gautama Buddha himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neelakesi&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neelakesi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The third Tamil epic is the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silappatikaram&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is about &quot;Kannagi, who having lost her husband to a miscarriage of justice at the court of the Pandyan Dynasty, wreaks her revenge on his kingdom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silappatikaram&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silappatikaram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final Tamil epic with a female protagonist is the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manimekalai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a sequel to &lt;em&gt;Silappatikaram&lt;/em&gt;.

On one occasion, however, he did bear offspring. A giant had undertaken to build the gods a fortress, his reward being Freyja and the sun and moon, provided the work was done by a given time. His sole helper was his horse, Svathilfari. The work being nearly done, and the gods fearing to lose Freyja and the sun and moon, Loki [fp. 160] turned himself into a mare, and so effectually distracted Svathilfari from his task that shortly afterwards Loki gave birth to Othin's eight-legged horse, Sleipnir. In such contests of abuse a man was not infrequently taunted with having borne children; cf. Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I, 39-45. One or two of the last three lines may be spurious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reference here is to a section of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/pre/pre04.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Gylfaginning&lt;/a&gt;, as told by Hárr, which speaks of this and the birth of Sleipnir, but it appears that you were already aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason I'm fairly certain that this is the event Othin refers to (besides the footnote saying that this is the only version) is that the Lokasenna is full of taunts like this, to stories that are never elaborated upon. These are examples of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;flyting&lt;/a&gt;, an exchange of insults common in Norse mythology and literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flyting often involved outright lying as part of taunts. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe08.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hárbarðsljóð&lt;/a&gt;, an exchange between Thor and a ferryman named Hárbarðr (thought to maybe be Odin or Loki!) starts out as boasts, mostly coming from Hárbarðr, but then devolves into insults, some of which are likely lies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even more interesting, there are several instances of each person challenging the other's manhood:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Harbarth spake:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  48. &quot;Sif has a lover at home, | and him shouldst thou meet;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  More fitting it were | on him to put forth thy strength.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Thor spake:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  51. &quot;Thou womanish Harbarth! | here hast thou held me too long.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The former is an accusation that Sif is not satisfied with Thor and has another, manlier lover. The latter is an outright insult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point of all this is that it seems highly likely that the passages you quoted were simple examples of flyting: Either references to obscure events or outright lies designed to put down the opponent. The anecdote about bearing children is most likely just another taunt about not being manly.

They fought for ten years, and Earth prophesied victory to Zeus if he should have as allies those who had been hurled down to Tartarus. So he slew their jailoress Campe, and loosed their bonds. And the Cyclopes then gave Zeus thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on Pluto they bestowed a helmet and on Poseidon a trident. Armed with these weapons the gods overcame the Titans, shut them up in Tartarus, and appointed the Hundred-handers their guards; but they themselves cast lots for the sovereignty, and to Zeus was allotted the dominion of the sky, to Poseidon the dominion of the sea, and to Pluto the dominion in Hades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, Library, 1.2.1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he lost the contest for Athens to Athena:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cecrops, a son of the soil, with a body compounded of man and serpent, was the first king of Attica, and the country which was formerly called Acte he named Cecropia after himself. In his time, they say, the gods resolved to take possession of cities in which each of them should receive his own peculiar worship. So Poseidon was the first that came to Attica, and with a blow of his trident on the middle of the acropolis, he produced a sea which they now call Erechtheis. After him came Athena, and, having called on Cecrops to witness her act of taking possession, she planted an olive tree, which is still shown in the Pandrosium. But when the two strove for possession of the country, Zeus parted them and appointed arbiters, not, as some have affirmed, Cecrops and Cranaus, nor yet Erysichthon, but the twelve gods. And in accordance with their verdict the country was adjudged to Athena, because Cecrops bore witness that she had been the first to plant the olive. Athena, therefore, called the city Athens after herself, and Poseidon in hot anger flooded the Thriasian plain and laid Attica under the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.14.1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, Library, 3.14.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And Athens wasn't even the only city the God of the Sea failed to get a hold of, his claim for Argos was denied by Hera: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Here is a sanctuary of Poseidon, surnamed Prosclystius (Flooder), for they say that Poseidon inundated the greater part of the country because Inachus and his assessors decided that the land belonged to Hera and not to him.

Nevertheless, it is the prince of fire and not the prince of ice that is commissioned to rescue Abraham as well as Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the fiery furnace (Pes. 118a; Ex.

As prince of fire Gabriel is also prince of the ripening of fruits (Sanh. 95b). As an angel representing an element of nature he is also connected with the metals: Gabriel is gold (the color of fire), Michael is silver (snow), Uriel is copper (Yalḳ., Ḥadash, s.v. &quot;Gabriel,&quot; No.75). Gabriel, girded like a metal-worker, shows Moses how to make the candlestick (Men. 29a). He has wings, like all the angels, but while Michael reaches the earth in one flight, Gabriel requires two (Ber. 4b, bottom).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize that this links Michael to snow, not water.

His survey done, and no point found to fail, he put his fears aside; when, as he roamed, Erycina [Aphrodite], from her mountain throne, saw him and clasped her swift-winged son, and said : `Cupido [Eros], my child, my warrior, my power, take those sure shafts with which you conquer all, and shoot your speedy arrows to the heart of the great god to whom the last lot fell when the three realms were drawn. Your majesty subdues the gods of heaven [and sea] . . . Why should Tartara (Hell) lag behind? Why not there too extend your mother’s empire and your own? The third part of the world’s at stake, while we in heaven (so long-suffering!) are despised--my power grows less, and less the power of Amor [Eros]. Do you not see how Pallas [Athene] and Diana [Artemis], queen of the chase, have both deserted me? And Ceres’ daughter [Persephone], if we suffer it, will stay a virgin too--her hope’s the same. So for the sake of our joint sovereignty, if that can touch your pride, unite in love that goddess and her uncle [Haides].’&#xA;  So she spoke. Then Cupido, guided by his mother, opened his quiver and of all his thousand arrows selected one, the sharpest and the surest, the arrow most obedient to the bow, and bent the pliant horn against his knee and shot the barbed shaft deep in Dis’ [Haides’] heart.&#xA;  &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/HaidesPersephone2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ovid, Metamorphoses 5. 462 ff (trans.

The larger numbers of diverse and disparate &quot;duties&quot; assigned to Hermes suggests he had originally begun &quot;god-life&quot; as a sort of &quot;composite-god,&quot; who had united the functions of a number of earlier male deities who had been worshiped by the people of smaller Greek city-states, which had later been vanquished by or incorporated into later and more-powerful city-states.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the &quot;deceitful&quot; reference to Hermes' behaviour, it's evident one of those earlier &quot;incarnations&quot; had been a &quot;trickster-god;&quot; while the &quot;helper of men&quot; role may have come from an agrarian god whose original function had been to assist men with completion of hard tasks; and the chronology continues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe, (though after 45 years and more I freely admit I may be mistaken) that it was Dr. T. C. Lethbridge who had explored at very great length the habit of Mankind to &quot;recycle&quot; the gods worshiped by earlier peoples (and, those who had later been &quot;assimilated peoples&quot;) of a particular area, into either later versions of gods. This also included merging traits of earlier gods into the &quot;aspects&quot; of later manifestations of gods belonging to later and more powerful regional peoples. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(One of his related, comprehensive, projects had been to demonstrate how the monuments and churches dedicated to more modern Christian Saints throughout Greater Britain had been &quot;recycled&quot; from pagan holy places that had originally been dedicated to gods of the so-called &quot;Old Religion.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for going on at such length, but I've always been fascinated by the European, Middle Eastern, and Oriental propensities for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Bending Knee At The Drop Of A Hat,&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so to say!

Not content merely to have &quot;matergod&quot; and &quot;patergod,&quot; however, they created extra &quot;parents&quot; (or perhaps &quot;elder-god-siblings&quot;) to assist them with virtually every civic, military, and domestic task imaginable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This may seem laughable, and it's obviously easy to sneer at forebears who're 3,000 years and more removed, but please remember: The Romans, Greeks, and their far-eastern kinfolk, the Indians, had all been pleased to adopt the gods of both the older cultures from which they had come, and the newer cultures whom they had met in transit, behaving (on the whole) in very unselfish manners, rather than acting like spoiled and pouty little children. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing more demeaning and depressing than observing two or more cultures gearing for battle, shouting at one another: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;My God Can Whup Yer God!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; like little boys brandishing &lt;strong&gt;&quot;heavenly fathers&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; at one another.

According to fiction, he is &lt;strong&gt;completely without achievement yet his greatness speaks for itself&lt;/strong&gt; once you meet him. In reality, he was a &lt;strong&gt;highly intelligent, well-connected, but inexperienced young man, with the reputation to match&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. not much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;ROTK&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is true that before serving Liu Bei, Zhuge Liang was completely inexperienced, at least as a strategist. Actually, the novel deliberately leaves the question of how he earned his reputation unanswered. His reputation, at least to Liu, stemmed solely from recommendation from very wise and talented men: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima_Hui&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sima Hui&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Shu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Xu Shu&lt;/a&gt; and other peers, all who insisted that Zhuge was even greater than they. You, like Liu, are meant to see Zhuge as a great mystery, and be intrigued: just who is this man, who has no accomplishments at all, and yet is highly regarded by none other than Xu Shu, the man who read Cao Ren like a book?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The novel teases at all this during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E5%9C%8B%E6%BC%94%E7%BE%A9/%E7%AC%AC037%E5%9B%9E&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;three visits to the thatched cottage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sequence, one of the best written parts and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://letsschmooze.blogspot.com.au/2010/11/act-two-part-two-midpoint.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;midpoint&lt;/a&gt; of the Liu Bei arc. Here the mystery and intrigue gets whipped up into a frenzy:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sima Hui tells how Zhuge believes that Xu Shu and his friends may be capable enough to become &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandery_(China)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;commandery&lt;/a&gt; administrators, but he is as capable as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guan_Zhong&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Guan Zhong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Yi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yue Yi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guan_Yu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Guan Yu&lt;/a&gt; is incredulous, but Sima believes that Zhuge is even greater, comparable to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Ziya&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jiang Ziya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Liang_(Western_Han)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zhang Liang&lt;/a&gt;. Those two men are widely considered among the greatest strategists in Chinese history, comparable to Alexander the Great or Hannibal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;時雲長在側曰：「某聞管仲、樂毅，乃春秋戰國名人，功蓋寰宇。孔明自比此二人，毋乃太過？」徽笑曰：「以吾觀之，不當比此二人。我欲另以二人比之。」雲長問那二人。徽曰：「可比興周八百年之姜子牙，旺漢四百年之張子房也。」&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On their first trip, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_the_Peach_Garden&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;three brothers&lt;/a&gt; encounter simple farmers singing something composed by Zhuge, whose short lyrics basically described the meaning of life. This establishes him as a philosopher of incomparable wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;次日，玄德同關、張并從人等來隆中，遙望山畔數人，荷鋤耕於田間，而作歌曰：&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;蒼天如圓蓋，陸地似棋局。&#xA;  世人黑白分，往來爭榮辱。&#xA;  榮者自安安，辱者定碌碌。&#xA;  南陽有隱居，高眠臥不足。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they reach his residence, it is described as having the serenity of heaven on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;不數里，遙望臥龍岡，果然清景異常。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trips, Liu repeatedly encounters people - friends, family of Zhuge - singing or reciting poems of great wisdom and insight, and he mistakes them all for Zhuge at first. Zhuge is so awesome that anyone related to him becomes wise also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they finally catch Zhuge present, he is sleeping. When he finally wakes, he composes a poem on the spot. He's just that good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;又立了一個時辰，孔明纔醒，口吟詩曰：&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;大夢誰先覺？&#xA;  平生我自知。&#xA;  草堂春睡足，&#xA;  窗外日遲遲。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later when Zhuge presents his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longzhong_Plan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Longzhong Plan&lt;/a&gt;, his reputation is sealed.

However his own reputation wasn't that great; only his closest friends recognised his talent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to his biography in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_the_Three_Kingdoms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Records of the Three Kingdoms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he was self-confident, and &lt;strong&gt;compared himself to Guan Zhong and Yue Yi, but this opinion was not widely shared&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, &lt;em&gt;only his friends&lt;/em&gt; (such as Xu Shu) agreed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;每自比於管仲、樂毅，時人莫之許也。惟博陵崔州平、潁川徐庶元直與亮友善，謂為信然。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his then-current occupation as farmer, he was well-connected and was previously being groomed to a life as public official. Unlike the novel which depicts him as a near-mythical hermit-farmer unknown to the outside world, he would have been &lt;strong&gt;well-known at least among the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingzhou_(ancient_China)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jing Province&lt;/a&gt; gentry&lt;/strong&gt;. He comes from a family of public officials: &lt;strong&gt;one of his ancestors was a Colonel Director of Retainers&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;漢司隸校尉諸葛豐後也。&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;His father was vice-administrator of a commandery&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;父圭，字君貢，漢末為太山郡丞。&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;His brother &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuge_Jin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zhuge Jin&lt;/a&gt; was already a high-ranking and trusted official within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Wu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wu&lt;/a&gt; court&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's also &lt;strong&gt;related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Biao&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Liu Biao&lt;/a&gt; by marriage&lt;/strong&gt;. It's a bit indirect though, and it goes like this: his father in law, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_Chengyan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Huang Chengyan&lt;/a&gt;, married the elder daughter of Cai Feng, who also had a son (the influential general &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cai_Mao&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cai Mao&lt;/a&gt;) and a daughter who married Liu Biao (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Cai_(Liu_Biao%27s_wife)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lady Cai&lt;/a&gt;). Zhuge can call Liu Biao &quot;uncle in law&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His uncle/foster father was quite well connected: &lt;strong&gt;he was a direct subordinate to Liu Biao&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;玄素與荊州牧劉表有舊，往依之。&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;he was a commandery administrator under &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yuan Shu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and even managed to get Zhuge a (minor) official position &lt;code&gt;從父玄為袁術所署豫章太守，玄將亮及亮弟均之官&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why would Liu personally visit Zhuge?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leaves very interesting questions about the &lt;em&gt;three visits&lt;/em&gt;. Given Zhuge's reputation, which wasn't that great, why would a famous warlord like Liu personally attempt to visit him in a remote village, &lt;em&gt;thrice&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here the historical records &lt;em&gt;contradict&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Both &lt;em&gt;Records of the Three Kingdoms&lt;/em&gt;, the most reliable, and (the first) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_Shi_Biao&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chu Shi Biao&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, authored by Zhuge himself, say that the three visits did happen. However according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weil%C3%BCe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brief Account of Wei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jiuzhou Chunqiu&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;it was the other way around: Zhuge visited Liu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to this interesting account, Zhuge visited Liu but was ignored due to his youth. When all the other guests left, Zhuge talked to Liu and presented a plan to conscript and tax the unregistered war refugees. This greatly impressed Liu and Zhuge was treated as an honoured guest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;亮乃北行見備&lt;/strong&gt;，備與亮非舊，又以其年少，以諸生意待之。坐集既畢，眾賓皆去，而亮獨留，備亦不問其所欲言。備性好結毦，時適有人以髦牛尾與備者，備因手自結之。亮乃進曰：「明將軍當復有遠志，但結毦而已邪！」備知亮非常人也，乃投毦而答曰：「是何言與！我聊以忘憂耳。」亮遂言曰：「將軍度劉鎮南孰與曹公邪？」備曰：「不及。」亮又曰：「將軍自度何如也？」備曰：「亦不如。」曰：「今皆不及，而將軍之眾不過數千人，以此待敵，得無非計乎！」備曰：「我亦愁之，當若之何？」亮曰：「今荊州非少人也，而著籍者寡，平居發調，則人心不悅；可語鎮南，令國中凡有游戶，皆使自實，因錄以益眾可也。」備從其計，故眾遂強。&lt;strong&gt;備由此知亮有英略，乃以上客禮之。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a minority opinion that this account is truthful, and the &lt;em&gt;three visits&lt;/em&gt; didn't happen. &lt;strong&gt;There's another, purely conjectural opinion that &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; are truthful&lt;/strong&gt;; perhaps Zhuge visited Liu first, earned his trust, then Liu later visited Zhuge where they discussed the Longzhong Plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mainstream opinion is that &lt;em&gt;Records&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chu Shi Biao&lt;/em&gt; are reliable. But there is doubt as to exactly how the &lt;em&gt;three visits&lt;/em&gt; worked out. &lt;em&gt;Records&lt;/em&gt; is extremely brief: &quot;[Liu] visited thrice, and met [with Zhuge].&quot; &lt;code&gt;凡三往，乃見。&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E5%89%8D%E5%87%BA%E5%B8%AB%E8%A1%A8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chu Shi Biao&lt;/em&gt; is a bit more detailed&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;[Liu] lowered himself and visited me thrice in the thatched cottage, where he consulted me on the affairs of our time.&quot; &lt;code&gt;先帝不以臣卑鄙，猥自枉屈，三顧臣於草廬之中，諮臣以當世之事&lt;/code&gt; The way &lt;em&gt;Chu Shi Biao&lt;/em&gt; depicts it suggests an alternate version of the &lt;em&gt;three visits&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Liu visited and met Zhuge thrice&lt;/strong&gt;. This is more believable, as visiting thrice but only meeting on the third occasion would have required uncommon patience (or desperation) on Liu's part. The way &lt;em&gt;Records&lt;/em&gt; is written, it could be interpreted either way. One other thing: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdic.net/z/14/js/4E09.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;thrice&lt;/em&gt; in classical Chinese also has the meaning of &lt;em&gt;many times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That is, Liu visited Zhuge repeatedly, over a long time span, where they slowly built up trust in each other, and formed the Longzhong Plan. This version is much more plausible than the novel's, where Zhuge presents the very detailed Longzhong Plan &lt;em&gt;on his first meeting with Liu&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But let's say we take the mainstream position that it was Liu who first visited Zhuge, and whatever happened - whether Liu visited thrice, or many times, and whether he met Zhuge on all occasions or only after three visits - we still need to explain &lt;strong&gt;why Liu would bother with the first visit.&lt;/strong&gt; Why didn't he summon for Zhuge, and why would someone of Liu's stature &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; visit Zhuge, someone with very little renown? Was Liu just a really humble guy, as Zhuge writes in &lt;em&gt;Chu Shi Biao&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zhuge was highly recommended by Xu Shu and Sima Hui.&lt;/strong&gt; This part of the novel is true. According to &lt;em&gt;Xiangyang Ji&lt;/em&gt;, Sima Hui singled out Zhuge and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pang_Tong&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pang Tong&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; two advisors to recruit from the region, describing them as &lt;em&gt;crouching dragon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;young phoenix&lt;/em&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;德操曰：「儒生俗士，豈識時務？識時務者在乎俊傑。此間自有伏龍、鳳雛。」備問為誰，曰：「諸葛孔明、龐士元也。」&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Records&lt;/em&gt;, Xu Shu was already highly trusted by Liu, and not only recommended Zhuge, calling him a &lt;em&gt;crouching dragon&lt;/em&gt;, but said that &lt;strong&gt;Liu should personally visit him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;徐庶見先主，先主器之，謂先主曰：「諸葛孔明者，臥龍也，將軍豈願見之乎？」先主曰：「君與俱來。」庶曰：「此人可就見，不可屈致也。將軍宜枉駕顧之。」&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether &lt;em&gt;crouching dragon&lt;/em&gt; was a well-known alias of Zhuge's, or (as the novel asserts) says that Zhuge was a peerless intellect, or simply used as an exaggeration by Sima and Xu is up to interpretation. It's also unclear how Xu Shu managed to convince Liu; maybe he was very persuasive, or trusted. We also don't know why Liu must visit personally, and not simply summon Zhuge; maybe Xu Shu said something like &quot;you have to go and see for yourself&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He was handsome and tall.&lt;/strong&gt; In those days looking good was considered a virtue in and of itself. Even &lt;em&gt;Records&lt;/em&gt; bothers to mention that he is 8 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_(unit)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;chi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tall (basically 6 foot) &lt;code&gt;身長八尺&lt;/code&gt;. There's an interesting anecdote of Cao Cao disguising one of his more handsome officials as himself, and himself as a guard, when meeting a Hun envoy because he was ashamed of being short and ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider Liu's position: although famous, &lt;strong&gt;he was extremely weak and desperate&lt;/strong&gt;.

That creature, bred in the swamp of Lerna, used to go forth into the plain and ravage both the cattle and the country. Now the hydra had a huge body, with nine heads, eight mortal, but the middle one immortal. So mounting a chariot driven by Iolaus, he came to Lerna, and having halted his horses, he discovered the hydra on a hill beside the springs of the Amymone, where was its den. By pelting it with fiery shafts he forced it to come out, and in the act of doing so he seized and held it fast. But the hydra wound itself about one of his feet and clung to him. Nor could he effect anything by smashing its heads with his club, for as fast as one head was smashed there grew up two. A huge crab also came to the help of the hydra by biting his foot. So he killed it, and in his turn called for help on Iolaus who, by setting fire to a piece of the neighboring wood and burning the roots of the heads with the brands, prevented them from sprouting. Having thus got the better of the sprouting heads, he chopped off the immortal head, and buried it, and put a heavy rock on it, beside the road that leads through Lerna to Elaeus. But the body of the hydra he slit up and dipped his arrows in the gall. However, Eurystheus said that this labour should not be reckoned among the ten because he had not got the better of the hydra by himself, but with the help of Iolaus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It only mentions that he dipped his arrows in the gall.

  <row Id="1478" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1455" CreationDate="2016-03-03T04:45:23.897" Score="9" Body="&lt;p&gt;This question needs to be answered from the perspective of the likely intent of the author and in light of what the term Eden meant in the times before and up to the period when the story was written (in my view probably 9th-7th centuries BCE, though perhaps somewhat later).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We must first recognize that, in the Eden story itself, the term &quot;Eden&quot; refers to the desolate/arid geographical region within which Yahweh both (a) created the man and (b) planted the garden (Gen 2.8: “a garden &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; Eden”). So looking simply and specifically for a region that could be characterized by paradise garden would be (so to speak) barking up the wrong tree. There is a Western Semitic root (&lt;em&gt;ʽdn&lt;/em&gt;), used for example in Ugarit, meaning lush or luxuriant upon which the author may have drawn in part when deciding how to name the Garden, but this gives us nothing about the garden’s location. (If anything, the linguistics would imply Syria, which does not appear consistent with the description in Gen 2:10-14.) Looking to Mesopotamia is more fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Mesopotamia the term referred to a dry plain (Sumerian (&lt;em&gt;edin&lt;/em&gt;) and Akkadian (&lt;em&gt;edinu&lt;/em&gt;), including between rivers; the more attested term in Akkadian was &lt;em&gt;seru,&lt;/em&gt; which was a translation of the same, pronounced as &lt;em&gt;seru&lt;/em&gt; but written with almost the same Cuneiform sign as the Sumerian. Akkadian was still the &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; of the region, but scholars debate whether an educated scribe in Judah such as the author of the Eden story would have been familiar with this word; but he did properly use it to refer to an arid area.... In any event, this information, together with that provided by the author in Genesis 2.10-14, suggests a location generally within Mesopotamia, perhaps between the Tigris and Euphrates. Frankly, having reviewed the various attempts to be more precise, I've seen that they all have serious problems and that none of them has gained traction among scholars. So I don’t think we can be more precise than what I’ve described here, and more significantly I doubt that the author intended any greater precision; probably he was deliberately not specific: He said only that Eden was “in the East” and that the 4 rivers flowed out of there (Gen 2:8). But we don’t know where “there” is, i.e., the location from which they are said to flow. Identifying the names of the rivers only brings us to somewhere in Mesopotamia, which gets us no further than what I’ve mentioned above. The somewhat fashionable hypothesis of the garden of Eden as referring to a lush area that now lies under the Persian Gulf (inspired in part by the Dilmun myth) runs aground against the biblical text: (a) as mentioned, our author said that &quot;Eden&quot; is actually an hostile, arid geographical region; (b) the Hebrew word used for &quot;garden&quot; in the story (&lt;em&gt;gan&lt;/em&gt;) means a fairly small, artificial garden (usually enclosed by walls), way too small to be a climactic area; and (c) our author said that the rivers split and flow &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the garden in Eden, not &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; it as would be the case with the mouth of what is now the Persian Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the description of the 4 rivers flowing from an unspecified point on Mesopotamian territory needs to be read mythologically, rather than as an attempt to be geographically specific. As mentioned, creation on earth began in a desolate Eden, signifying a  kind of primordial chaos (only desert rather than waters) onto which the order of creation was imposed. By having Yahweh form the first human and the first plants (i.e., the Garden) there, he made the Garden the center of creation and the original center of the earth, which makes it a holy place, which is why Yahweh had his presence there. It is a Center in the sense meant by Mircea Eliade and Joseph Campbell (Eliade and Sullivan; Eliade; Campbell), where primordial chaos was transformed into the order of creation, which is why it is sacred. The 4 rivers flowing from that spot symbolize the Garden as that Center, and also helps explain how the rest of the earth (originally barren  outside of the Garden) became fertile and full of life. The imagery of the Center is further enhanced by the 2 sacred trees being there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I should mention that in choosing the term Eden the author may have been making a secondary allusion to Beth Eden mentioned elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible (Amos 1:5; 2 Kings 19:12; Isaiah 37:2). This was an Aramaic kingdom on the banks of the upper Euphrates in Syria (so no dry steppe here). Its name in Aramaic (&lt;em&gt;bit-adini&lt;/em&gt;) means &quot;House of Eden,&quot; with &lt;em&gt;adini&lt;/em&gt; being the family name of the ruling dynasty (cf. &quot;House of David&quot;). By the time the Eden story was written, Assyria had taken over Beth Eden, and was using it as a launching base from which to invade Syria-Palestine. Thus, the author may have been employing &quot;Eden,&quot; on the one hand, to allude to the military, cultural, and pagan religious threat coming from Assyria/eastern Syria at the time, while on the other hand as an ideal place (i.e., Israel, land of milk and honey) arising from within and being threatened by this surrounding hostile cultural and religious environment. (The Eden story was, after all, in significant part a polemic against &quot;foreign&quot; pagan religion.) From this perspective, Israel was viewed as the ideal Center of the world, and more specifically Jerusalem itself, especially its Temple (George and George, pp. 121-24).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is only the tip of the iceberg.

Helen's portrayal in the Greek and Roman sources presents a wide variety of different interpretations. Perhaps &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; canonical is Apollodorus' &lt;em&gt;Bibliotecha&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately, we do not have this part of his work, though an epitome has survived. Here's what it says about Helen:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Menelaus, with five ships in all under his command, put in at Sunium, a headland of Attica; and being again driven thence by winds to Crete he drifted far away, and wandering up and down Libya, and Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Egypt, he collected much treasure. And according to some, he discovered Helen at the court of Proteus, king of Egypt; for till then Menelaus had only a phantom of her made of clouds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epitome&lt;/em&gt; 6.29, trans. by Frazer&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A little background is necessary to understand where he got this idea:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But some say Hermes, in obedience to the will of Zeus, stole Helen and carried her to Egypt, and gave her to Proteus, king of the Egyptians, to guard, and that Alexander repaired to Troy with a phantom of Helen fashioned out of clouds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Epitome 3.3-5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Helen, instead of actually being at Troy, is merely a copy. It's theorized that Zeus did this because she is his daughter by Leda, and later ideas that she is taken straightaway to Olympus instead of back to Sparta support this; moreover, her divine brother was made into a constellation, and Helen &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; worshiped as a goddess in Sparta in historical times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, Menelaus would not in fact mention Helen in his troubles getting to Egypt, because he did not have her yet. But the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; really doesn't support this, which is why both passages are prefaced with &quot;according to some/some say.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authors who do support this, though, include Stesichorus (seventh to sixth century), Herodotus, and Euripides (fifth century). In fact, Stesichorus might have made it up, perhaps based off the passage in the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; you found confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Euripides does conflicting things with this information. In his &lt;em&gt;Trojan Women&lt;/em&gt;, there is a strong implication that Helen is actually at Troy, and that Menelaus takes her away from there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(She and Hecuba argue about who is at fault, and while Menelaus sides with Hecuba, he disregards her advice to kill Helen on the spot, lest, Hecuba argues, Helen gets out of punishment by her feminine charms.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, Euripides wrote another work, his &lt;em&gt;Helen&lt;/em&gt;, in which Hera, not Zeus, fashioned a phantom for Hermes to take to Egypt because she was angry with Paris for choosing Aphrodite as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/JudgementParis.html&quot;&gt;most beautiful of the goddess&lt;/a&gt;. Herodotus even says that when he was in Memphis, Egypt, Egyptian priests confirmed that Helen was there, though there was no phantom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if Helen is in Egypt, as later authors indicated, she was found by Menelaus there. Otherwise we must assume that the author of the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; just glossed over her presence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="398" LastActivityDate="2016-03-09T01:44:37.420" CommentCount="0" />

In the Dinoysos cult, a &quot;Kosmos&quot; (gr. &lt;em&gt;κῶμος&lt;/em&gt; kōmos) was staged, a procession with song, the participants masked and wearing the skin of a he-goat (gr. &lt;em&gt;τράγος&lt;/em&gt; tragos), to impersonate the god himself or his accompanying satyrs. The theatrical form of tragedy developed from a myth sung in chorus, ... The choral parts of the theatrical dramas are a rudiment of this ancient form, the dialog parts a later, secondary addition.

The Greek tragedy is defined by a fated conflict of the protagonist: the failure of the protagonist is unavoidable, because of the constellation he or she are placed in. Think of Oedipus: He did nothing wrong, it was his fate to kill his father and marry his mother. In contrast to a modern hero, there was nothing that he could to to avoid that fate. Modern heros on the other hand either succeed or fail because of their own deeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ancient Greek comedy also derived from the Dionysian procession (see &quot;komos&quot; in my translation above). But while the tragedy took the mythic part of the procession and told stories of gods and men, the comedy took the festive part and became a satire and critique of (then) current politics and society.

The superstitions in this book are often of a medical kind (e.g. certain plants heal certain illnesses) or ritualistic (e.g. harvesting – or not – at full moon or catching the bride's flower bouquet).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The belief in dwarves predates the existence of a German nation and is Germanic in origin. Many of the tales collected by the Brothers Grimm are known to other peoples as well, and are not exclusively German at all. Taking your example, there are versions of the tale that the Grimms published under the name of &lt;em&gt;Snow White&lt;/em&gt; from all over the world. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sevendwarfs/other.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; lists many of these stories, some of them from Africa. The page gives a book as source that collects these tales, if you are interested. Similarly, dwarves (of the Germanic kind) can be found in tales from all over Middle and Northern Europe, and are not exclusive to the tales of the Brothers Grimm. And most certainly, the majority of the German people no longer believed in dwarves at the time the Grimms collected their tales. They are not part of German superstition, but part of Germanic myth (in the folklorist meaning of the word).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, after all this rumination, what I think you are asking is which of the Grimms' tales contain references to Germanic myths. My answer would be: probably none of them, or only vaguely. Fairy tales are a different type of folktale than myths. Fairy tales are not tales about literal truths, but contain a moral in symbolized form. No one believed that there ever was a princess Snow White, but everyone (even today) believes in the underlying truth that diligence (exemplified in Snow White's service to the dwarves) and Snow White's other virtues will overcome evil in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this is not what you are asking, please edit your question to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1324" LastActivityDate="2016-03-14T17:37:47.727" CommentCount="5" />

Shu and Tefnut have Geb and Nut as children, and Geb and Nut have the famous siblings Osiris, Isis, Nephthys (Nebt-Het), Set, and (sometimes another form of Horus-who-wasn't-a-child-of-Isis). There are also texts about the gods being made from the sweat of Atum (etc) and humans, male and female, produced from his tears.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's the Memphis cycle, which involves Ptah using speech to bring about the universe. There are a lot of variations of this. A version is also preserved on the Shabaka Stone in the British Museum. Shabaka, one of the Nubian pharaohs, (25th Dynasty) ordered it made based on a 'worm-eaten papyrus'. Unfortunately, the stone was turned into a millstone at some point, with a hole punched in the center.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Hermopolitan story involves the Ogdoad- 4 male frog gods and 4 female snake goddesses, who cause the primal bit of land to emerge from the Nuun. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amun, who was one of the Ogdoad also has a creation story centered around him. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other stories include Geb being in the form of a goose and laying a cosmic egg on the primal mound of land. One about Ra emerging from the bud of the first water lily (there's a statue from Tut's tomb that references this). And the goddess Neith (Nit, Net) created the world by differentiating the land from the waters, again from the undifferentiated Nuun. In some versions, the goddess Mehet-Weret 'Great Flood' is involved with Neith's story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes more than one of these cycles is mentioned in the same text, so they weren't always exclusive of each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="95" LastActivityDate="2016-03-16T03:41:22.477" CommentCount="0" />

This would include Perseus, Tantalus, Minos, etc (see the wikipedia page for Zeus for more). In fact, four of the twelve gods of Olympus are his children- Athena, Hephaestus, Ares, and Dionysus.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Being ruler of the sky pretty much cinches him as the ruler. In ancient Greece, the sky was always above you, huge, unreachable, and full of mysterious pwers they didn't understand. It would make sense if their chief deity was the controller of all that.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BUT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although Zeus is generally portrayed as king god, remember, there is no &quot;set in stone&quot; verion of the myth. Since the Bronze Age, they were generally told orally from one person to another, each embellishing and carving it to their own liking. The version of the myths as most people today know them were described (and, importantly, written down) by authors such as Ovid, Homer,and Hesoid. While it is likely that their version of the myths was similar to everyone else's, there is no reason to believe that everything had to be exactly as we know it. A lot can change in a few thousand years! Sure, a thing like &quot;who's chief of the gods&quot; is a mighty thing to change, but as you mentioned, it would actually make sense for Poseidon to be the chief deity, even if Zeus was technically king. Here's why:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Greeks (and the Romans, too, for that matter) lived on the Mediterranean. A map of their world looked something like this:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/mRvKN.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/mRvKN.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of their world, if you notice, was ocean, or more specifically, Oceanus, the personification of the sea that supposedly surrounded the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the most part, Greece was a bunch of islands with some annoying mountains here and there. The sea was a huge part of their lives, whether they wanted it to be or not.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In fact, the sea would probably be as mysterious as the sky to them. They wouldn't know about currents, or how storms worked, or about how come there were tides. There's only so much land-based weather could do the Greeks. They are not really in a region prone to tornadoes or anything like that. However, storms on the ocean were probably more or less normal- and much more powerful.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And who ruled pver this massive, dangerous, all-powerful sea? Poseidon. As if that wasn't enough, he was also given the title of Earthshaker, attributing even more power and destruction to him.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Much like Zeus,many of his children were significant in mythology, including Bellerophon, Charybodis, and Proteus. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From all this, it would make sense that the ancient people favored Poseidon over Zeus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that I didn't mention the trident. That's because during a battle the giants gave each of the three elder gods a gift. Poseidon got his trident, Hades got the helmet of darkness which can  make him disappear, and Zeus was given the lightning bolt.

One of the problems with reading translations online is that they are usually old (i.e. out of date) translations. So I think your confusion about whether Bernlak is &quot;enchanted&quot; (i.e. controlled using magic) partly comes from the fact that Tolkien's translation isn't up to date. I'm not sure if the word bewitched is the right word to use in this context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, part of your confusion comes from the fact that &lt;em&gt;the story is deliberately confusing&lt;/em&gt;. The fact that Morgan is the mastermind behind the plot of Bernlak considerably changes how we interpret the story. Yet at the same time, this fact is revealed almost as an afterthought, at the end of the story after all of the action has taken place. It's almost as if Morgan is being used as an excuse for the action that took place during the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as a way of answering this question, here are some of the ways that this revelation changes the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key feature in the story is that although the narrative primarily focuses&#xA;on male characters, it turns out that women characters are the ones who are in&#xA;control of the story. So most analyses of the story focus on how this fact&#xA;influences the gender dynamics of the story. One of the interesting things about&#xA;celtic literature is that it subverts a lot of gender roles, and as a result it's studied by people interested in gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/27869340&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sodomy, Misogyny, and Displacement: Occluding Queer Desire in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;&lt;/a&gt; focuses on the exchanges that Gawain and Bernlak make during the course of the story. As you know, Gawain and Bernlak make a promise: for three days Bernlak would give Gawain whatever he found in the forest, and Gawain would give Bernlak whatever he found in the castle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Gawain is in the castle, Bernlak's wife attempts to seduce Gawain. Gawain is able to avoid this, and they only kiss. But throughout the story, Gawain has to avoid committing adultery with Bernlak's wife. The obvious, stated reason for this is that doing so would -- to put it mildly -- be disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The less obvious, unstated reason is that if Gawain had sex with Bernlak's wife, Gawain would have to share that experience with Bernlak. At the time the story was written, Britain was extremely homophobic. So Gawain having sex with Bernlak would be extremely problematic, as well as dishonorable to Arthur's court.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gawain manages to avoid having sex with Bernlak's wife (and thus Bernlak). But Bernlak, as the person who came up with the game that potentially could have led to Bernlak and Gawain to violate Britain's gender norms, could be interpreted as wanting to have sex with Gawain. More to the point, the story could be interpreted as depicting a man wanting to have sex with another man. So hence the fact that Morgan is blamed for causing the events in the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is only the tip of the iceberg: &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=gawain%20morgan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;there are a lot of different interpretations of the story out there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2016-03-21T04:03:03.360" CommentCount="0" />

This is however only after death. Remember Hercules, Roman Emperors, the Chinese Emperors, various Saints...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I am looking for is quite similar to Gilgamesh's quest for immortality. He did find a plant that at least restored youth.&#xA;Or sometimes Ambrosia is described as granting not only immortality, but making a god out of a mortal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also in Taoism humans are able to gain immortality and god-like powers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I ask again, across the plethora of mythologies that exist in the world, what is the easiest way a mortal can become a god?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I truly have to draw a parallel with Gilgamesh and his search for immortality here.&#xA;First he visits Utnapishtim, whose type of immortality is ideal, but was a gift from a god, so not easily obtainable.&#xA;I am unsure if successfully passing Utnapishtim's test would have led to something, but this appears to me as the most easiest way.&#xA;Then there is the Ur-shanabi, which is probably the same thing as ambrosia, Idun's apples, but we cannot be sure, so it could be an solution.&#xA;Finally we have the solution of cultural immortality, which is for me not a solution at all, given that he feared to become a forgotten rotting corpse, and become a remembered rotting corpse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what if Gilgamesh was more open minded and cunning. Why settle for immortality when you can become a god? Why limit the search in Mesopotamia, when there is the whole world.&#xA;Within all the world religions what is the easiest way to become a god?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1417" LastEditorUserId="62" LastEditDate="2016-04-04T23:13:33.400" LastActivityDate="2016-05-14T02:58:22.740" Title="What is the easiest way to become a god?"

Aside from those you've ruled out, the easiest and quickest war to become a god would be to possess some great magical ability and use it for an epic act. This still would be no guarantee of reverence however. The gods of the great polytheistic religions are not only powerful immortal beings, what makes them gods is that they are also worshipped, often after conferring some favour on the mortals who worship them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general becoming deified and being worshipped as a god is a much more difficult path, and usually is conferred after death. In the case of most major beliefs it is a combination of charisma, great works, original teachings, and transcendence to a higher plane. Think Jesus or Buddha (in some schools of Buddhism). Most recently Elvis upon death (or alleged death) has received a sort of god-like status, although some consider this to be more of a sainthood. Ghandi also pledged subservience to multiple religions so has achieved more of a saintly status.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The major case of a living god I can think of is Haile Selassie being worshipped in Rastafari as a reincarnation of Jesus, though this is also due to how he lived his life to that point, so again not what you would call easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Dalai Llama is conferred quite early in life, although I wouldn't necessarily say he is considered a god.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other way is by starting a cult. This generally only makes you a god, or reincarnation of one, to a few people. It's small scale, but still divinity of sorts, and comes with plenty of perks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way is to embody an archetype, as it is with many polytheistic gods. A modern example might be Hendrix as a guitar god.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A final way is to create a species or even a whole world. Frankenstein was the god of Adam. The founders in Star Trek are the gods of the Vorta and the Jem'Hadar&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What's the easiest way to become immortal?&quot; Would be a whole different question.

He aks the wise man Solon whether he has seen any other man happier then himself.&#xA;Solon answers that he knows of King Tellos who was not only happy because he ruled over a peaceful and prosperous kingdom but also died gloriously in battle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;King Croesus then asks him who might be the second most happy man in the world, sure that he must be the one.&#xA;Solon answers that once there were two sons. Their mother needed to go by cart to a temple but the oxen which were supposed to pull the cart were still on the field and would never make it back on time. So the two sons went and pulled the cart instead to the temple. The whole crowd in front of the temple admired their devotion to their mother and their mother praid to the goddess to grant her children happiness. All went to sleep but the two sons never woke up. They died in the moment of highest glory. The villagers praised them and built them statues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Croesus becomes irritated and now asks Solon directly what the wise man thinks of his riches. Solon replies with the proverbial phrase to never judge a person's happiness before one sees how he ends. Croesus becomes angry but indeed, a few days after the wise man leaves, all kinds of distasters strike the king. His son dies in an accident and he looses a battle against the Persian king. Thinking of the wise man's words he cries out his name 'Solon, Solon, Solon!'. The Persian king asks him about the meaning of this, hears the story and is so impressed that he spares Croesus life and even makes him his counselor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: to die in the moment of highest happiness (granted by glory/youth/...) is itself a thing of happiness. Perhaps a variation of this also exists as a myth referring to Apollo. And I think I know of some more variations (athletes who die in the moment of their victory etc.) but can't remember, whether they, too, were an example of Solon or in a separate story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1427" LastActivityDate="2016-04-05T14:41:46.930" CommentCount="0" />

People were sunk in the island of Atlantis for their immorality. It was ruled by ten Titan rulers, Atlas as the Eldest. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Plutarch,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He [Solon] also spent some time in studies with Psenophis of Heliopolis [in Egypt] and Sonkhis (Sonchis) of Sais, who were very learned priests. From these, as Plato says, he heard the story of the lost Atlantis, and tried to introduce it in a poetical form to the Greeks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wonder about the Egyptian connection, between Atlantis. Where does that come from?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some other mysterious quote from Plato:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Now first of all we must recall the fact that 9000 is the sum of years since the war occurred, as is recorded, between the [Atlantes] dwellers beyond the pillars of Herakles and all that dwelt within them; which war we have now to relate in detail. It was stated that this city of ours [Athens] was in command of the one side and fought through the whole of the war, and in command of the other side were the kings of the island of Atlantis, which we said was an island larger than Libya and Asia once upon a time, but now lies sunk by earthquakes and has created a barrier of impassable mud  which prevents those who are sailing out from here to the ocean beyond from proceeding further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, now what is this war? What is this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some stuff about the rulers,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Concerning the allotments of the Gods, that they portioned out the whole earth, here into larger allotments and there into smaller, and provided for themselves  shrines and sacrifices, even so Poseidon took for his allotment the island of Atlantis and settled therein the children whom he had begotten of a mortal woman in a region of the island of the following description. Bordering on the sea and extending through the center of the whole island there was a plain, which is said to have been the fairest of all plains and highly fertile; and, moreover, near the plain, over against its center, at a distance of about 50 stades, there stood a mountain that was low on all sides. Thereon dwelt one of the natives originally sprung from the earth (autokhthones), Euenor by name, with his wife Leukippe; and they had for offspring an only-begotten daughter, Kleito. And when this damsel was now come to marriageable age, her mother died and also her father; and Poseidon, being smitten with desire for her, wedded her; and to make the hill whereon she dwelt impregnable he broke it off all round about; and he made circular belts of sea and land enclosing one another alternately, some greater, some smaller, two being of land and three of sea, which he carved as it were out of the midst of the island; and these belts were at even distances on all sides, so as to be impassable for man; for at that time neither ships nor sailing were as yet in existence. And Poseidon himself set in order with ease, as a god would, the central island, bringing up from beneath the earth two springs of waters, the one flowing warm from its source, the other cold, and producing out of the earth all kinds of food in plenty. And he begat five pairs of twin sons and reared them up; and when he had divided all the island of Atlantis into ten portions, he assigned to the first-born of the eldest sons  his mother's dwelling and the allotment surrounding it, which was the largest and best; and him he appointed to be king over the rest, and the others to be rulers, granting to each the rule over many men and a large tract of country. And to all of them he gave names, giving to him that was eldest and king the name after which the whole island was called and the sea spoken of as the Atlantic, because the first king who then reigned had the name of Atlas. And the name of his younger twin-brother,  who had for his portion the extremity of the island near the pillars of Herakles up to the part of the country now called Gadeira after the name of that region, was Eumelos in Greek, but in the native tongue Gadeiros,--which fact may have given its title to the country. And of the pair that were born next he called the one Ampheres and the other Euaimon; and of the third pair the elder was named Mneseus  and the younger Autokhthon; and of the fourth pair, he called the first Elasippos and the second Mestor; and of the fifth pair, Azaes was the name given to the elder, and Diaprepes to the second. So all these, themselves and their descendants, dwelt for many generations bearing rule over many other islands throughout the sea, and holding sway besides, as was previously stated, over the Mediterranean peoples as far as Aigyptos (Egypt) and Tyrrhenia [in Italy].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Describes the 10 Titans of above. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Random goodness of Atlantis... TL;DR Atlantis was a sort of paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The springs they made use of, one kind being of cold, another of warm water, were of abundant volume, and each kind was wonderfully well adapted for use because of the natural taste and excellence of its waters; and these they surrounded with buildings and with plantations of trees such as suited the waters; and, moreover, they set reservoirs round about, some under the open sky, and others under cover to supply hot baths in the winter; they put separate baths for the kings and for the private citizens, besides others for women, and others again for horses and all other beasts of burden, fitting out each in an appropriate manner. And the outflowing water they conducted to the sacred grove of Poseidon, which contained trees of all kinds that were of marvellous beauty and height because of the richness of the soil; and by means of channels they led the water to the outer circles over against the bridges. And there they had constructed many temples for gods, and many gardens and many exercising grounds, some for men and some set apart for horses, in each of the circular belts of island; and besides the rest they had in the center of the large island a racecourse laid out for horses, which was a stade in width, while as to length, a strip which ran round the whole circumference was reserved for equestrian contests. And round about it, on this side and on that, were barracks for the greater part of the spearmen; but the guard-house of the more trusty of them was posted in the smaller circle, which was nearer the acropolis; while those who were the most trustworthy of all had dwellings granted to them within the acropolis round about the persons of the kings.&#xA;  And the shipyards were full of triremes and all the tackling that belongs to triremes, and they were all amply equipped.&#xA;  Such then was the state of things round about the abode of the kings. And after crossing the three outer harbors, one found a wall which began at the sea and ran round in a circle, at a uniform distance of fifty stades from the largest circle and harbor, and its ends converged at the seaward mouth of the channel. The whole of this wall had numerous houses built on to it, set close together; while the sea-way and the largest harbor were filled with ships and merchants coming from all quarters, which by reason of their multitude caused clamor and tumult of every description and an unceasing din night and day.&#xA;  Now as regards the city and the environs of the ancient dwelling we have now well-nigh completed the description as it was originally given. We must endeavor next to repeat the account of the rest of the country, what its natural character was, and in what fashion it was ordered. In the first place, then, according to the account, the whole region rose sheer out of the sea to a great height, but the part about the city was all a smooth plain, enclosing it round about, and being itself encircled by mountains which stretched as far as to the sea; and this plain had a level surface and was as a whole rectangular in shape, being 3000 stades long on either side and 2000 stades wide at its center, reckoning upwards from the sea. And this region, all along the island, faced towards the South and was sheltered from the Northern blasts. And the mountains which surrounded it were at that time celebrated as surpassing all that now exist in number, magnitude and beauty; for they had upon them many rich villages of country folk, and streams and lakes and meadows which furnished ample nutriment to all the animals both tame and wild, and timber of various sizes and descriptions, abundantly sufficient for the needs of all and every craft.&#xA;  Now as a result of natural forces, together with the labors of many kings which extended over many ages, the condition of the plain was this. It was originally a quadrangle, rectilinear for the most part, and elongated; and what it lacked of this shape they made right by means of a trench dug round about it. Now, as regards the depth of this trench and its breadth and length, it seems incredible that it should be so large as the account states, considering that it was made by hand, and in addition to all the other operations, but none the less we must report what we heard: it was dug out to the depth of a plethrum and to a uniform breadth of a stade, and since it was dug round the whole plain its consequent length was 10,000 stades. It received the streams which came down from the mountains and after circling round the plain, and coming towards the city on this side and on that, it discharged them thereabouts into the sea. And on the inland side of the city channels were cut in straight lines, of about 100 feet in width, across the plain, and these discharged themselves into the trench on the seaward side, the distance between each being 100 stades. It was in this way that they conveyed to the city the timber from the mountains and transported also on boats the seasons' products, by cutting transverse passages from one channel to the next and also to the city. And they cropped the land twice a year, making use of the rains from Heaven in the winter, and the waters that issue from the earth in summer, by conducting the streams from the trenches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Manpower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As regards their manpower, it was ordained that each allotment should furnish one man as leader of all the men in the plain who were fit to bear arms; and the size of the allotment was about ten times ten stades, and the total number of all the allotments was 60,000; and the number of the men in the mountains and in the rest of the country was countless, according to the report, and according to their districts and villages they were all assigned to these allotments under their leaders. So it was ordained that each such leader should provide for war the sixth part of a war-chariots equipment, so as to make up 10,000 chariots in all, together with two horses and mounted men; also a pair of horses without a car, and attached thereto a combatant with a small shield and for charioteer the rider who springs from horse to horse; and two hoplites; and archers and slingers, two of each; and light-armed slingers and javelin-men, three of each; and four sailors towards the manning of twelve hundred ships. Such then were the military dispositions of the royal City; and those of the other nine varied in various ways, which it would take a long time to tell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unstoppable,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Such was the magnitude and character of the power which existed in those regions at that time; and this power the God set in array and brought against these regions of ours on some such pretext as the following, according to the story. For many generations, so long as the inherited nature of the God remained strong in them, they were submissive to the laws and kindly disposed to their divine kindred. For the intents of their hearts were true and in all ways noble, and they showed gentleness joined with wisdom in dealing with the changes and chances of life and in their dealings one with another. Consequently they thought scorn of everything save virtue and lightly esteemed their rich possessions, bearing with ease the burden, as it were, of the vast volume of their gold and other goods; and thus their wealth did not make them drunk with pride so that they lost control of themselves and went to ruin; rather, in their soberness of mind they clearly saw that all these good things are increased by general amity combined with virtue, whereas the eager pursuit and worship of these goods not only causes the goods themselves to diminish but makes virtue also to perish with them. As a result, then, of such reasoning and of the continuance of their divine nature all their wealth had grown to such a greatness as we previously described. But when the portion of divinity within them was now becoming faint and weak through being oft times blended with a large measure of mortality, whereas the human temper was becoming dominant, then at length they lost their comeliness, through being unable to bear the burden of their possessions, and became ugly to look upon, in the eyes of him who has the gift of sight; for they had lost the fairest of their goods from the most precious of their parts; but in the eyes of those who have no gift of perceiving what is the truly happy life, it was then above all that they appeared to be superlatively fair and blessed, filled as they were with lawless ambition and power. And Zeus, the God of gods, who reigns by Law, inasmuch as he has the gift of perceiving such things, marked how this righteous race was in evil plight, and desired to inflict punishment upon them, to the end that when chastised they might strike a truer note.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More Plutarch,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Plato, ambitious to elaborate and adorn the subject of the lost Atlantis, as if it were the soil of a fair estate unoccupied, but appropriately his by virtue of some kinship with Solon, began the work by laying out great porches, enclosures, and courtyards, such as no story, tale, or poesy ever had before.  But he was late in beginning, and ended his life before his work. Therefore the greater our delight in what he actually wrote, the greater is our distress in view of what he left undone. For as the Olympieion in the city of Athens, so the tale of the lost Atlantis in the wisdom of Plato is the only one among many beautiful works to remain unfinished.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He wrote all that and never finished???

It has always been considered that the more distant a planet, the less significant its influence.  The outer planets become more subtle and affect longer periods of time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This subtlety meant that earlier astrological pronouncements using only the visible planets were not negated by the discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Uranus was discovered in 1781 it was seen to have a more elliptical orbit than the known planets and, of course, a longer orbital period.  Astrologers sought to find a meaning for it and essentially extrapolated from the properties assigned to the known planets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Uranus became the planet of unpredictability.  Afflicted aspects to other planets were seen to disrupt the other planet's affect in unpredictable ways.  This could perhaps, to modern eyes, be seen as bit of a cop out - we don't know what it does, let's make it unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Uranus was then seen as the governor of old age.  Its orbit of 84 years means that not many people see its Return (the Astrological return of a planet to the place it occupied at your birth).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the natal chart, Uranus became known for discoveries, advancement, wisdom and progress.  All these things were taking place at the time of the planet's discovery.  The Industrial Revolution was taking place.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neptune was discovered in 1846 and has an orbit of 165 years.  Astrologers found it vague and assigned it power over vague areas.  Neptune became the planet of introversion, addiction and mysticism.  It was associated with artists - its strange properties influencing creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, perhaps these were common thoughts in the psyche of the time.  For both new planets they seemed to be associated with things that were happening in society at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The effect of both these planets when in aspect with the better known planets was described according to normal astrological practice.  Afflicted or beneficial aspects would be calculated to disrupt or enhance planetary influence just as, say, a Moon Square Mars would be seen to influence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a separate matter, Pluto is the planet of regeneration and renaissance.

This is not trivial; in some circles the idea of a god dying is nonsense, because the definition of a god includes being immortal. In other groups, gods are typically mortal and the idea of one being immortal sounds amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second (and maybe more interesting) is what counts as 'dying'? Many deities have been killed, only to be resurrected. Certainly that makes them mortal, but it doesn't make them 'dead'. If the body is destroyed, but their consciousness remains (for example, you mention Jesus, who now resides in the Kingdom of Heaven) does that count?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Dying God Mythology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Golden Bough&lt;/em&gt;, anthropologist James Frazer analyzed (among many other things) myths about &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/goldenboughstudy04fraz#page/n17/mode/2up&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dying gods&lt;/a&gt;.

There is also some brief mention within, of how the nine-tailed fox myth is easily as old as the Eastern Han dynasty, judging by some of the imagery it has been depicted in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What has happened then, is that through Noh, and artists like Utagawa and Hokusai in the 1800's, Japan has claimed and revitalized the story of the nine-tailed fox, by merging it with that of numerous historical femme fatales, throughout India, China, and Japan. Bao Si. Daji. Tamamo-no-Mae. The nine-tailed fox itself, you will find, is not mentioned in any other story, about fox beings given human guise, in present recollection. Rather, it is epicly credited, within a handful of closely associated 'comparitively-modern' Japanese works, that the nine-tailed fox traveled from country to country to sow seditious discord, before finally ending its spree, with the life of Tamamo-no-Mae.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best to think about it this way: the stories of the nine-tailed fox, the fox-courtesan, or 'huxian', and the trickster 'kitsune', are all variations on what foxes signified to people in different countries, over the ages. The feminine. The barbaric, outsider spirit. The trickster nature spirit. Their stories happened to grow up in tandem with folk religion, and each often contested the social norms of the time, even going so far as to spur social change (fox mediumship is one example represented in Chinese accounts). Because worship of fox spirits was heterodox--(for instance, in Shinto, Inari is discouraged from being associated AS the fox, but people form their own personal beliefs about Inari being the fox anyway), these stories often shadow a dominant religion, and are suppressed or appropriated by it in a constant struggle for rule.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What then happens is that folk superstition, especially represented in imagery, leads to the curiosity of literati, and their works preserve the ever-mutating myths. It is entirely possible that the 'kitsune' myth came about as a result of immigration and the influx of Buddhism and Taoism, into Japan. Looking back at some of Japan's significant mythical figures--Abe no Seimei, child of Kuzunoha, is reflected to be an Onmyoji--a Tao sorceror. Dakini-ten from Buddhist mythos, likewise, is depicted as a divine being riding a white fox. Such similar imagery and stories readily blend together, and synchronicity makes for the telling of a great ongoing ghost tale, readily picked up by any storyteller, regardless of its veracity or true origin. Your culprits in this case, are the same artists we have discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's easier to assume that, if there 'were' fox beings, they had whatever powers people wanted to ascribe to them at the time, and are only as connected or disconnected from one another, as their muddied lore, which travels orally, through visual icons, and through works of fiction-- gradually deviating based on cultural assumptions. Western pop culture, has effectively nurtured its own variations on the fox myths, which now live with us through our own interest. Which often is colored by New Agery, Therians and Otherkin, and misconceived notions about Shinto and Buddhist deities--and propagated by the works of anime lovers and furries. Likewise, Korea likes to depict the nine-tailed fox, explicitly, as a vampiric human-like seductress, and they are as common of a sight in dramas and movies there, as werewolves or vampires might be, here. The main difference nowadays being, that we possess an internet, to be more aware of these cultural deviations to the myth, as they occur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a never ending process of mutation.

But why do we consider this symbol one of such good luck? Even though many of us are fond of this symbol, most are not completely familiar with the origins and symbolism connected to the horseshoe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, horseshoes have been crafted by blacksmiths, this action alone gives the horseshoe good luck powers due to the fact that blacksmithing was considered to be an extremely lucky trade because the work required the use of one of the main elements – fire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The origin of the lucky horseshoe is traced back to Saint Dunstan, a blacksmith who later became archbishop of Canterbury, and the legend of his run in with the devil. There are several versions of the tale but all have the same outcome. The stories can’t seem to agree on how he did it but he is believed to have nailed a red hot horseshoe to the devil’s hoof causing the devil great pain. The saint bargained with the devil and agreed to remove the shoe if the devil agreed to never enter a house or building with a horseshoe hung above the door. Other versions say that the devil simply avoided homes with horseshoes due to the turmoil it had once caused him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In Turkey and adjacent areas of Greece, the horseshoe is used as a magical protecting agent against the evil eye which is a look given by a person who is envious or dislikes you that is said to cause you harm or bad luck. Horseshoes from this culture are usually metal or blue glass and are often integrated with an all-seeing eye emblem making them into a charm that averts evil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Another legend originating in Europe is that worn out horseshoes were thought to posses special powers and are used as magical protective amulets. Many believe it is the shape alone that gives horseshoes their magical powers since it replicates the very shape of the pagan crescent or horned moon from which it is believed that horseshoes draw their power. When being used a for protection the horseshoe was hung over barn and stable doorways with its open end pointing downwards. It is said that no witch will pass under an upside down horseshoe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1241" LastActivityDate="2016-06-04T03:42:08.717" CommentCount="1" />

In the Satya (aka Krita) Yuga, almost all humans are good.  In the Treta Yuga, most humans are good but some are bad.  It's during one of the past Treta Yugas that the Hindu epic the Ramayana took place.  In the Dwapara Yuga, most humans are bad but some are good.  The Hindu epic the Mahabharata took place in the most recent  Dwapara Yuga.  And finally, we have the Kali Yuga, the age of evil we're currently living in, where almost all humans are bad.  The present Kali Yuga will end when Kalki, whom I discuss here, comes and annihilates the evil people, and then the Satya Yuga will begin again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now many cultures and ideologies idolize an imagined past in order to explain or criticize the world of the present.  So my question is, have any Indologists theorized that the Kali Yuga was invented in the Kali Yuga?  That is to say, have they theorized that the system of the four Yugas was invented at a certain point in time, that that point in time was declared to be part of the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, and Hindus have been considering themselves to be in the Kali Yuga ever since?  Or is the consensus of Indologists that there was a time in history when Hindus considered themselves to be living in some Yuga other than the Kali Yuga?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have come across Indologists who have advanced a slightly less bold thesis.  Most Hindu scriptures, including the Mahabharata and the Puranas, are believed to have been composed in the Dwapara Yuga.  So their discussion of the Kali Yuga take the form of prophecy, describing things like the mixing of castes, the abandoning of Vedic Dharma, and the invasion of India by Mlecchas or foreigners.  I have seen Indologists argue that such descriptions are not actual prophecies, but rather &quot;retroactive prophecies&quot; written by people who were describing the actual state of the society they were living in, and the faults they found with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But are any Indologists willing to go one step further, and say that the very concept of the Kali Yuga was invented by people to diagnose why their society fell short of the ideas of Vedic society?  I suppose one piece of evidence they could use is that the Yuga system is seldom mentioned in the Vedas, and is mainly mentioned in later texts like the Puranas.  And also there is a verse, widely believed to be spurious, in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana which says certain Vedic practices like animal sacrifice and Niyoga (which I discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/a/7628/36&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) were allowed in earlier Yugas but are prohibited in the Kali Yuga.  This could be seen as an indication that people were accustomed to using the concept of Yugas to relegate aspects of Hinduism they didn't like to an earlier age whose customs are presumed no longer relevant to the world as it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that Ia, a devout Hindu and a strong believer in the Yuga system; I'm just posting this question because I'm curious as to what secular scholarship has to say on this subject.

After Herophilus and Erasistratus, human dissection again became absent from &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; subsequent Greek science, not to resurface for some 1700 years (in 14th century Italy).  However, a unique set of circumstances were at work in Herophilos's home of Alexandria.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the key elements: Ptolemaic Egypt (and thus Alexandria), was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; democratic:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In Alexandria, a scientist's fellow-residents could not vote to ostracize of exile him on grounds of impiety, as they could--and did--in &quot;democratic&quot; Athens&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, the Ptolemies, wanted to establish Alexandria as a center of learning, and so extended generous patronage to scientists and scholars.  It was the kings who, not only allowed Herophilos and Erasistratus to pursue cadaver dissection, but also handed over condemned criminals for &lt;em&gt;vivisectory&lt;/em&gt; experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Ptolmies also had little respect for the Greek taboos of the time, and may have set examples of violating them, themselves:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, Alexandria was a new frontier city in which traditional Greek values were not considered intrinsically superior.  Indeed, the Ptolemies themselves set examples--shocking to some Alexandrian Greeks--of violating traditional Greek taboos...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the philosophical climate may have contributed making it more acceptable, particularly Aristotelian thought, who spoke specifically on the subject of the corpse:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is clear that a corpse is a human being &lt;em&gt;in name only&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Even though a dead person also has the same external form and shape, it nevertheless is not a human being...&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  So too the &quot;hand&quot; of a person who has died is a hand &lt;em&gt;in name only&lt;/em&gt;, just as flutes in a stone sculpture might also be called &quot;flutes&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2016-06-07T16:49:34.243" LastActivityDate="2016-06-07T16:49:34.243" CommentCount="0" />

He stilled the waves with the blow of a conch-shell trumpet. Triton was also described as the god of the giant, Libyan, salt-lake Tritonis. When the Argonauts were stranded in the desert he assisted them in finding passage from the lake back to the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Trtion was depicted in Greek vase painting as fish-tailed merman, sometimes bearded, sometimes youthful. In Greek sculpture and mosaic he was often given twin fish or dolphin tails. Mosaic art added a pair of crab-claw &quot;horns&quot;, green-tinged skin, and sometimes a pair of equine forelegs. As Poseidon's herald, he had a winged brow and conch-shell trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Triton was often multiplied into a host of sea-spirits called Tritones which were regarded as satyr-like daimones of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/7akKg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/7akKg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Triton&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Skylla.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Skylla&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;SKYLLA (or Scylla) was a monstrous sea goddess who haunted the rocks of certain narrow strait opposite the whirlpool daemon Kharybdis. Ships who sailed too close to her rocks would lose six men to her ravenous, darting heads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Homer describes Skylla as a creature with twelve dangling feet, six long necks and grisly heads lined with a triple row of sharp teeth. Her voice was likened to the yelping of dogs. This description of Skylla is probably derived from the imagery of words associated with her name: namely, &quot;hermit-crab&quot; (Greek skyllaros), &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;dog-shark&quot; (skylax), and &quot;to rend&quot; (skyllô). In classical art she was depicted as a fish-tailed sea-goddess with a cluster of canine fore-parts surrounding her waist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Late classical writers say that she was once a beautiful nymph who was loved by the sea-god Glaukos. She has a jealous rival in the witch Kirke who used her magics to transform Skylla into a monster.

  <row Id="1718" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1715" CreationDate="2016-06-12T00:48:46.817" Score="0" Body="&lt;p&gt;Ah, well,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not a exact answer, as this is probably where you got it from, but, here goes!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;At least three Ancient Greek authors denied that Helen ever went to Troy; instead, they suggested, Helen stayed in Egypt during the duration of the Trojan War. Those three authors are Euripides, Stesichorus, and Herodotus. In the version put forth by Euripides in his play Helen, Hera fashioned a likeness of Helen (eidolon, εἴδωλον) out of clouds at Zeus' request, Hermes took her to Egypt, and Helen never went to Troy, spending the entire war in Egypt. Eidolon is also present in Stesichorus' account, but not in Herodotus' rationalizing version of the myth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Herodotus adds weight to the &quot;Egyptian&quot; version of events by putting forward his own evidence—he traveled to Egypt and interviewed the priests of the temple (Foreign Aphrodite, ξείνης Ἀφροδίτης) at Memphis. According to these priests, Helen had arrived in Egypt shortly after leaving Sparta, because strong winds had blown Paris's ship off course. King Proteus of Egypt, appalled that Paris had seduced his host's wife and plundered his host's home in Sparta, disallowed Paris from taking Helen to Troy. Paris returned to Troy without a new bride, but the Greeks refused to believe that Helen was in Egypt and not within Troy's walls. Thus, Helen waited in Memphis for ten years, while the Greeks and the Trojans fought. Following the conclusion of the Trojan War, Menelaus sailed to Memphis, where Proteus reunited him with Helen.&#xA;  &lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Troy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Troy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we see that some authors disagree, but a lot more do agree. I'll just give you Herodotus's account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reed.edu/humanities/Hum110/Hdt/Hdt2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Herodotus's account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Correcting Homer: Paris and Helen in Egypt&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Egyptian priests say Paris and Helen were blown off course on their way to Troy and shipwrecked near a shrine of Heracles in Egypt. The servants of Paris took refuge at the shrine and denounced him as a rapist to the local Egyptian official, Thonis. Thonis had Paris arrested and brought before King Proteus at Memphis (113-14). Proteus conducted an investigation and pronounced Alexander guilty; he kept Helen in Egypt and sent Paris home (115). Citations of Homer prove that he was aware of this version (116). This incidentally also proves that the Cypria, a poem of the Epic Cycle, is not by Homer (117). All this leads Hdt. to ask the Egyptian priests whether in their opinion the Trojan War really happened. Menelaus himself told their predecessors that it did, but that the Greeks only learned the truth, that Helen was in Egypt, after the fall of Troy (118). Menelaus went to Memphis to retrieve Helen and was well received by Proteus; but he later fled Egypt in disgrace after sacrificing two children to allay contrary winds (119). Hdt. believes this version and supports it with an argument from probability: if the Trojans had had Helen, they would surely have given her back rather than allow their entire city to be destroyed (120).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, we see that Herodotus does give a account of Helen being on Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="967" LastActivityDate="2016-06-12T00:48:46.817" CommentCount="0" />
