A lot of hotends use steppers, which may result in ripples in the filament, so you may end up building a nearly custom filament machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Resolving all these problems is probably not worth simply selling or giving away the filament to someone that can use it, and buying the right size for your machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are still interested, though, you might as well go all the way and build a full filament extruder that accepts raw plastic feedstock (usually pellets) as well as your filament, and convert it that way, then continue using it to create your own filament." />

As further travel moves are performed in each layer, this turns to a web.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The high temperature causes filament to be very liquid, causing it to move downward in the nozzle chamber easily, as opposed to having to be extruded forcefully due to viscosity. The temperature setpoint of 210 was high enough to cause this to happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second possible cause, insufficient retraction, can also be blamed for this issue. Retraction is a process in which the extruder reverses its movement to pull filament back up the hotend, preventing it from dripping at the tip, and forming a string. Most slicers will allow specifying a numeric value in millimeters of filament to be retracted. Remember that printers with Bowden tubes between nozzle/hotend and extruder motor will require increased retraction and priming (extrusion when starting to print after a retract-and-move). Note that too much retraction can cause other problems, such as insufficient plastic in the hotend chamber at the start of the next printing move, which can cause gaps and other issues." />

Essentially the first layer (or two) will not adhere as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is just one suggestion of many solutions. Here are some other variables I could think of off-hand:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Type of build plate tape (ie masking, painters, kapton, etc.)&#xD;&#xA; - Type of material. I've noticed that PLA is very stubborn if you let the part completely cool after printing and that it's much easier to remove the part from the build plate/raft right after it's complete.&#xD;&#xA; - Type of build plate. Are you applying too much heat (if you have a heated bp) for the material such as PLA?&#xD;&#xA; - Try lowering your layer height. This will ensure that each strand does not have too much surface area and therefore less chance that it will create a vacuum affect with the build plate.

However, the fundamental reason for the &quot;warping&quot; is incorrect and inconsistent temperature across the material.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there is too much fluctuation in the temperature across the object in this heated state can result in warping. The reason you see this mostly on the build plate is because the temperature of the first few layers of molten plastic vary much more against the build plate than against higher layers. Note that you can see additional warping mid-print using ABS and this can be a result of a draft or sudden drop in ambient temperature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, to help solve your problem, here are some suggestions (sorry if there are duplicates):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Completely enclose/seal your machine's build area to reduce (or eliminate if possible) draft and prevent the natural heat of the machine from escaping.&#xD;&#xA; - Increase the temperature on your build plate. I almost exclusively use ABS on my printer and I keep my HBP at about 112C. However, I live in the NW of the US, so my climate is naturally cooler than say Florida.&#xD;&#xA; - Alternatively, try decreasing the nozzle temperature to a lower point within the ABS melting range. This will just shorten the gap between the inconsistencies in temperature across layers. It is typically better to print at lower temperatures if you can help it. Obviously there are differences in the filament, so you'll have to find that &quot;sweet spot&quot;.&#xD;&#xA; - Ensure your build plate is flat and your tape doesn't have bubbles. Your BP being flat should be a no brainer, but if your kapton tape (or whatever you use) has bubbles, your freshly printed plastic may not be getting the same temperature from the BP as the rest of your part. This is a bad thing as mentioned earlier.&#xD;&#xA; - Use extra adhesion techniques such as &quot;ABS Glue&quot; (ABS w/ acetone) or even hairspray. This works about 80% of the time for me, but can make it a bit difficult when removing the parts off the BP." />

Most of the transparent PLAs I've used print much more clear at around 240°C.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ABS - I've seen some pretty impressive clear parts printed as a single layer shell in ABS and then vapor smoothed. I tend to find ABS more translucent and less transparent though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PETG - Again the specific PETG you use matters, but I haven't seen nearly as much variation as with PLA.  I'm not sure how much temperature matters, but if it's too hot you get bubbles which will decrease clarity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thin Wall Prints - I don't have much experience here, but the Smooth On XTC-3D or vapor smoothing seem to be effective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Solid Prints&#xD;&#xA;If I want transparency, I usually print it at 100% infill (should be a real 100%, too much overextrusion or underextrusion will decrease transparency).  Printing slower and with less cooling sometimes helps.  It's easier to get the infill solid with a direct drive extruder, I couldn't get decent results with a long bowden tube (a short bowden tube works fine).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's a page where I tested 10 transparent filaments, the printed samples are 2mm thick, 100% infill - http://thrinter.com/10-transparent-filaments.  Those samples are all overextruded a bit, you can get better results if you dial in the extrusion precisely, but that's hard to get right, and the optimal settings may change slightly depending on the part geometry.  Larger nozzles and thicker layers may help to, but I haven't experimented much with that as there are significant downsides to that approach." />

An acetone &quot;explosion&quot; is even more unlikely, since you need a ratio of 2.5%-12.8% acetone vapor to air for that: too much acetone (as would be the case inside of your smoothing vessel) and nothing happens, too little (as would be the case inside of a badly ventilated room) and nothing happens either.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that even if you were working in a completely non-ventilated, ridiculously small 1m^3 room you'd still need to evaporate over half a liter of (liquid) acetone to reach that bare minimum 2.5%. In any case, well before you got into the &quot;danger zone&quot; the air would become unbreathable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, then what do you have to be mindful of when using acetone?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * It can give you a headache. Avoid breathing the fumes and ensure adequate ventilation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * You may opt to use gloves, as skin contact should be avoided (acetone can irritate the skin and possibly be absorbed through the skin). However, limited skin contact isn't a big deal: acetone is an ingredient in some nail polish removers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; *  Acetone is heavier than air, so if you use a sufficiently high container fewer fumes will escape.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * If somehow a fire does start, it will likely be limited to your container. Having a lid handy allows you to starve the fire of oxygen, harmlessly putting it out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, smoothing using acetone is not very dangerous. Acetone isn't suspected to be carcinogenic, though it isn't something you should be careless around either. The risk of starting a fire is small. On the other hand, solvents like MEK (used for smoothing PLA aren't as nice by far, and should only be handled with a respirator." />

There are many ways you can 3D print a part, even on the same machine, that can yield different results.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some tips to help uphold strength requirements:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Identify where your stresses are and avoid allowing the natural &quot;grain&quot; of the print (ie each layer) to coincide with the stresses of the part. For example, I just printed a part with hinges today. I set my part up to ensure that the circular profile of the hinge on each layer, instead of having the machine &quot;bridge&quot; the circular profile.&#xD;&#xA; - Make your part more solid by increasing the infill. Note that somewhere around 35% won't really provide much more strength than say 50% with a standard infill pattern (ie hexagonal, diamond, catfill). However, I would imagine that if a spherical infill pattern was ever designed, that would be the strongest.&#xD;&#xA; - An easy way to beef up small areas of a part is to increase your shell variable (how many profile layers for each layer). Again, referencing my hinge design, I made sure that my hinges were completely printed using shell instead of shell/infill.&#xD;&#xA; - Don't be afraid to do some post-processing such as adding epoxy(ies) in high-stress areas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it's not an expensive part to print, I would suggest playing with some of these ideas yourself and conduct controlled tests to see what setups work best for your application(s)." />

To answer your question, I would suggest using a larger layer height for the sheer fact of reducing print time on larger objects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it depends on the part and how small the details are on the part. If your part has sharp edges that are required for the proper functionality of the part, then you'll want to use a smaller layer height. Or if your part fits into another part, you'll probably want to use a smaller layer height.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another variable might be whether or not post-processing is necessary.

And as you have not given any budget constraint, I would give you a list of materials which would help you achieve the task, and you can choose amongst them accordingly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Plastics: Basically used for building prototypes. Nylon Polyamide should be a choice for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Polyamide 3D printing is achieved through SLS 3D printing. It offers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; strong and flexible prints. The upside of this material is that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; printing technology requires minimum preparation of the 3D file before&#xD;&#xA;&gt; printing. There is no need for support. And it also offers the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; possibility to create intricate shapes and moving part in just one go.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; After the print the polyamide can be polished and dyed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Metals: Metals like Brass, Alumunium and Steel should be a good choice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, if I were to achieve your task, I would select carbon fiber. some details about it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Carbon fiber consists of 90% carbon atoms, each fiber is 10 times&#xD;&#xA;&gt; thinner than a human hair. Carbon is especially prized for its lack of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; combustibility and infusability but also by its incredible strength&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (stronger than steel) and ability to create flexible structure, light&#xD;&#xA;&gt; weight and corrosion resistance. Its melting temperature is 1500, this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; heat there are only carbon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Feel free to add suggestions in the form of comments and I will try to incorporate them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Summary&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - ABS: Stronger, machinable, more flexible, and more temperature&#xD;&#xA;   resistant than PLA. Typically printed on a heated bed. Warping is a common problem when printing ABS.&#xD;&#xA; - PLA: Wider range of filaments available, easier and in some cases faster to print. Not as strong as ABS and the fact that its biodegradable could be seen as both a benefit and a drawback.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Material Properties:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - ABS: Strong plastic with mild flexibility. Naturally beige in color. Can be filled and sanded. Higher temperature. Easy to recycle.&#xD;&#xA; - PLA: Not as strong as ABS but more rigid. Naturally transparent. More difficult to fill and sand. Can sag in hot temperatures. Sourced from organic matter so it can be broken down in commercial compost facilities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Part Accuracy:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - ABS: Part warping is a significant issue. Sharp corners will often be rounded.&#xD;&#xA; - PLA: Less heat required contributes to less warping. Becomes more liquid at common extruder temperatures so finer details can be printed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Safety and Handling:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - ABS: Strong burning/melting plastic smell is present when printing ABS. Health concerns have been raised regarding airborne ultrafine particles generated while printing with ABS ([ref][2]). ABS will absorb moisture causing popping when the moisture enters the hot end. This leads to discontinuities in the print job.&#xD;&#xA; - PLA: Doesn't smell as strongly when printing due to its organic nature. Moisture can also be absorbed into PLA and can irreversibly damage it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.protoparadigm.com/news-updates/the-difference-between-abs-and-pla-for-3d-printing/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.atmosenv.2013.06.050" />

Depending on the motors you're driving and the size of the load you could actually see a decrease in quality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although microstepping increases theoretical resolution it does not necessarily increase accuracy. The reason is that microstepping significantly limits the incremental torque of the motor. This means that you may ask for a step but not get one because the torque of the step won't be enough to actually turn the shaft.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an example: a motor running in full steps will have 100% of its rated holding torque. Moving to 16 microsteps/full steps drops this to ~10%, 128 drops it to ~1%.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The practical effect of this is that in high torque situations (such as printing at fast speeds) the motor may end up skipping some of the steps. In this way the increase in resolution can actually lead to a decrease in accuracy (smaller steps but they may not actually be taken).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A relevant calculation to do would be to work out what the different number of microsteps to full steps works out to in terms of horizontal, vertical, or whatever movement the motor drives. You can do this by measuring how far the stepper moves said surface in one revolution provided you know the number of steps it takes per revolution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Example:** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With no microstepping: 1 turn/inch * 200 steps/turn = 200 steps/inch or .005 inch/step (127 micron resolution)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With 16x microstepping: 16 * 200 steps/inch or .0003 inch / step (8 micron resolution)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this example 128x microstepping would be absolutely foolish. Every situation is different and you should use this information to make a decision based on your setup. Many manufacturers have recommendations on how far their motors can be microstepped." />

For instance, rather than listing ABS as an item, it lists the three monomers that constitute ABS seperately, so you have to read through the Acrylonitrile section, the butadiene section, and the styrene sections seperately to understand the food safety aspects of ABS.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course someone has gone to the trouble of parsing all these different regulations in different countries and created a book that summarizes much of what you can glean from individual databases, [Global Legislation for Food Contact Materials][6] J S Baughan but it's not an inexpensive resource, and needs constant update so may need to be repurchased each year to keep up with the latest legislation worldwide. It would, however, be a handy reference and starting point for a hack space or library for makers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that these are regulations formulated by government bodies.  They may have a scientific basis (and hopefully they all do) but they do not replace your own testing and common sense.

This is my situation - where I live dedicated workshops and extra rooms are luxuries that most people do not have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Realistic Chance of Being Dangerous --&gt; Treat It As Dangerous&#xD;&#xA;==&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key information at this point in time is [the UFP (Ultra-Fine Particle) study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086) that is linked in [Tom's answer](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/12/188).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Leaving out the scary / detailed parts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Therefore, results herein suggest that caution should be used when&#xD;&#xA;&gt; operating these 3D printing instruments inside unvented or unfiltered&#xD;&#xA;&gt; indoor environments due to their large emissions of UFPs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; One important limitation to this study is that we have no information&#xD;&#xA;&gt; about the chemical constituents of the UFPs emitted from either type&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of 3D printer [...]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [...] there may also be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; differences in toxicity because of differences in chemical&#xD;&#xA;&gt; composition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This means that although many processes release UFPs (the authors of the paper compare to cooking), all UFPs are not created equal. Since the UFPs from 3D printing are still an unknown, the only real answer from a safety perspective is to treat them as dangerous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is not legal, safety, or professional advice!&#xD;&#xA;==&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not qualified to give an opinion on what should be done but I will share what I would do:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Venting** - Active airflow pushing the envelope of air around the print into a large, unpopulated body of air.&#xD;&#xA;- **Enclosure + Venting** - By fully enclosing your printer, it will probably keep the UFPs mostly within the enclosure. You could combine that with either continuous venting or as some have suggested purge venting before opening the enclosure.&#xD;&#xA;- **Enclosure + Filtering** - A filter can be applied both to the vent to reduce the output of UFPs (e.g. if you have no access to a safe body of air) and as a recirculating system that removes the UFPs from the body of air within the enclosure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A note on [positive vs negative pressure](http://www.silverstonetek.com/techtalk_cont.php?area=en&amp;tid=wh_positive)** related to venting and filtering: if you produce positive pressure within the enclosure, you are going to be blowing all the UFPs out into your environment anyway. Negative pressure vented to a safe body of air or neutral pressure with good seals and recirculated filtering may avoid that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A note on filters**: Activated carbon filters will not remove UFPs. HEPA filters may remove 3D printing UFPs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which Printer?&#xD;&#xA;==&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as the uncertainty exists, I predict that as the market matures, filtering and enclosures will become more standard. At this point in time, the only enclosed AND HEPA filtered consumer-grade FDM printers I am aware of are the [Up! Box](https://www.3dhubs.com/3d-printers/up-box) and the [Zortrax Inventure](https://www.3dhubs.com/3d-printers/zortrax-inventure). There are a number of enclosed printers without filtering.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an alternative, at least [one company](http://www.3dprintclean.com/) has appeared with products targeted at those who are concerned about various safety aspects of 3d printing." />

This type of ridging can be caused by a filament coil that is binding occasionally, or a filament that doesn't have an even diameter or volume per length.  Binding within the filament feeder and feeder tubes can also be a cause. Bubbles in the filament, or sometimes a mismatch between the filament ideal temperature and the head temperature could create results like this, but it probably wouldn't vary so much between the layers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next I'd look at the print head.  If it has blockages, or poor temperature control this could result.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, I'd check the mechanisms - disconnect the motors and see if all the carriages slide smoothly without any binding, particularly the Z axis.  It doesn't look like you're missing steps, but binding here may result in greater backlash, which could result in similar ridges. Make sure any belts and gears are tight." />

When the slicer encounters a gap, it will either treat the endpoint as the end of the feature or navigate to the next point on the layer, resulting in either gaps in the print or extra inclusions that don't make sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've noticed that my models will fail as a true solid when I use complex solid tools such as Union, Subtract, and Trim.

The most common[citation needed] right now is Fused Filament Fabrication. &quot;Liquid light-sensitive resin&quot; is being used in Stereolitography and Digital Light Processing - the SLA printers I found are less common and more expensive than FFF ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Price**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Need to decide on budget. You can buy printer for 60k USD and 400 USD. Quality is somehow linked to price but that's not a rule. You can buy a shitty printer for a lot of money.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Printing area**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bigger allows you to print bigger things. You need to ask yourself how big things you really want to print. Remember that 3d printing is quite slow process - how often you will want to print big things that will take 60hrs+ to finish?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Printing materials**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What kind of materials you want to print with? Some materials will need higher temperatures so check the max hot-end temperature, some will require heated bed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Assembled or DIY kit**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can usually get kits for self-assembly cheaper than Ready-To-Print machines. However, it will require additional skills (i.e. soldering), tools and time to assemble. I am not sure if I would buy DIY kit for commercial use, but as an enthusiast I immensely enjoyed putting my Rostock Max together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Reviews and reputation**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is generally safe to buy printer that already has some users. Beware of new magical Kickstarter printers which will &quot;change the 3d printing forever&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;Reddit /r/3dprinting suggests that your new printer should meet 3 criteria:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Printer passes the youtube test - has lots of youtube evidence that this particular printer is working.&#xD;&#xA; - Printer is out of the pre-order phase. This means that all pre-orders have been delivered.&#xD;&#xA; - Printer has a reputation of working well among current users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found it to be a very good set of rules.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Upgrade capabilities**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's very user-dependent, but this point is very important to me. I want to be able to change and improve certain parts of my printer. Check if you can switch the extruder, replace the hot-end etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Support**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think one of the most important points. See if you can find a forum for your printer and how active community is. It will be immensely helpful if something goes wrong (and it will).&#xD;&#xA;Also, company support is very important. What will happen if you need a replacement part or your printer will stop working altogether?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This list is definitely not complete.&#xD;&#xA;There are many more things that might be taken into account like configuration (delta or XY), multiple extruders, closed cases etc." />

Be especially mindful of the wires from your power supply to the board, as getting those the wrong way around will definitely cause damage. Heated beds and extruders are not polarity sensitive, and can go in either way. Fans are polarized, but will probably survive if you get them backwards - they just won't run. Stepper motors don't care about polarity, flipping the connector around just makes them run backwards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Take special care with endstops. The endstop connectors have 3 pins (VCC, 5V and signal), endstops with 2 pins are usually connect to GND and signal. Putting a 2-pin endstop across 5V and GND will destroy the 5V regulator.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * A common cause of damage is wires not being clamped in their respective terminals properly. The offending wire will arc, melting and destroying the connector. Tighten down screw terminals properly, use proper crimps if you have them. Soldering the ends of wires going into screw terminals is not encouraged, but if you do solder the ends then make sure to check after a while and tighten the screws again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Put the stepper drivers in the right way around.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * For things like the heated bed and wires going to your power supply, use sufficiently thick wires.

With multiple extruders you can get one color per extruder; there's no clear way to mix colors and get a color between the input materials' colors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another, more complicated approach is to use a single extruder with three inputs, like [this one](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Diamond-hotend-Prusa-i3-Extruder-Full-kit-E3D-V6-Brass-Multi-Color-Nozzle-3-IN-1/32516521911.html), where thermoplastic from the three inputs can be mixed in varying amounts to get color gradients between the input colors.

The plastic should stick nicely during printing, yet release reasonably easily when you remove the print from the heated bed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lay down a later of Kapton tape. The principle is the same as masking tape, but Kapton tape has a smooth surface and is more durable than masking tape. The down side is Kapton tape is far more expensive, and applying it correctly is a LOT more work, since you have to use water and you have to keep bubbles from getting underneath it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put some ABS scraps into a bottle of Acetone, and allow the acetone to break down the ABS til you have a slurry. Spread this slurry as evenly as possible across the build plate, and allow the acetone to evaporate away. This leaves a thin film of ABS on the plate, and will release much better than if you print directly onto the build plate. I recommend using clear ABS if you can, since some of it will stick to your print and clear will be the least visible. You'll need to re-apply it regularly, since it will come off with your print where it touches the build plate. **WARNING**: Use proper ventilation and avoid contact with acetone. That stuff's not good for you. Also it's flammable, so keep a fire extinguisher nearby.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I prefer the ABS/acetone slurry method, but it requires good ventilation and a handy fire extinguisher.

The theoretical speed that can be achieved during the travel with your set acceleration (yellow line).&#xD;&#xA; 2. The time required to reach your target speed, and for how long it will hold that speed before slowing down (blue line).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, setting `acceleration = 3000, length = 30 and speed = 150` it will take somewhat less than 5 seconds to reach the desired speed of 150 mm/s, while that same acceleration theoretically could give a speed of 300 mm/s. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Calculating speed, acceleration and jerk:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In many cases your printer will have some limitation in maximum speed or settings given by your provider that can be used as a starting point.

First find the *maximum speed* your printer can tolerate. One way of doing this is to print an object with long travel distances, and vary the maximum travel speed.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Using the calculator above, increase the *acceleration* for various traveling distances until you get suitably smooth acceleration curves for your desired speed for medium to long traveling distances.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Adjust your *jerk* setting to allow for quick speedup on short traveling distances. Jerk speed is the speed that the printer will immediately jump to before taking acceleration into account. With a jerk of 20mm/s, the printer will make an immediate jump from 0 to 20 mm/s, and thereafter speed up to the desired speed by following the acceleration profile.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a rule of thumb, it might be smart to then set the actual speed, jerk and acceleration approximately 20% below the the maximum found as a safeguard when printing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, bear in mind that [the strength of stepper motors lowers for higher speeds][2], so that if the nozzle hits will not hold its path very well if obstructed.

Bridging will need extra layers to ensure good layer adhesion and any supports will have to be removed carefully to not damage the surface.&#xD;&#xA; * Perimeter start/end: The joint where the perimeter starts/ends not only has to seal to the layer below but it has to seal with the now cooling start point.  This could be especially problematic if all of your layers are started at the same point (which visually produces a vertical seam) because you don't have a smooth perimeter on the previous layer and any imperfections in the joint are compounded.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thoughts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Print on end where possible: You'll get a higher quality outer perimeter if your layers are full rings instead of printing up both sides of a pipe on its side.&#xD;&#xA; * If you can manage a single perimeter when printing on end try using the &quot;spiral vase&quot; setting, which will smoothly raise the z position and print as a spiral instead of printing discrete layers.  This removes any issues related to sealing the start/end of a perimeter.&#xD;&#xA; * If you're printing with multiple perimeters increment the wall thickness in multiples of the nozzle size to ensure the perimeters are sealed together.  Having the perimeters not bound together increases the chance of leaks and reduces stiffness.&#xD;&#xA; * Do the pipes have to have the same thickness all along them?  You can probably reduce thickness to save material for simple geometry (straight sections) if you change thickness gently." />

The theoretical speed that can be achieved during the travel with your set acceleration (yellow line).&#xD;&#xA; 2. The time required to reach your target speed, and for how long it will hold that speed before slowing down (blue line).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, setting `acceleration = 3000, length = 30 and speed = 150` it will take somewhat less than 5 seconds to reach the desired speed of 150 mm/s, while that same acceleration theoretically could give a speed of 300 mm/s. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Calculating speed, acceleration and jerk:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In many cases your printer will have some limitation in maximum speed or settings given by your provider that can be used as a starting point. If not, trial and error is the most straightforward way of doing it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would separate speed calibration into three task:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. First find the *maximum speed* your printer can tolerate. One way of doing this is to print an object with long travel distances, and vary the maximum travel speed.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Using the calculator above, increase the *acceleration* for various traveling distances until you get suitably smooth acceleration curves for your desired speed for medium to long traveling distances.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Adjust your *jerk* setting to allow for quick speedup on short traveling distances. Jerk speed is the speed that the printer will immediately jump to before taking acceleration into account. With a jerk of 20mm/s, the printer will make an immediate jump from 0 to 20 mm/s, and thereafter speed up to the desired speed by following the acceleration profile.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a rule of thumb, it might be smart to then set the actual speed, jerk and acceleration approximately 20% below the the maximum found as a safeguard when printing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, bear in mind that [the strength of stepper motors lowers for higher speeds][2], so that the nozzle will not hold its path very well if obstructed.

Adding a brim to the print.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Blue painters tape on the acrylic, remove the other material if doing this.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Place cheap piece of glass/mirror on bed and use hairspray/gluestick.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Use hairspray/gluestick directly on acrylic.  You must be careful here because first layer height is very critical to prevent damage to the acrylic from the plastic welding.  A layer of hairspray or glue should prevent it but dial in your height before printing.&#xD;&#xA; 5. If you aren't currently using a fan, you could try sealing the sides to prevent drafts.

Regarding the type of fan to get, they stated that: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It seems that the fan shroud you choose is less important than the fan type. The blower fan was consistently weighted above the stock 40 mm fan regardless of shroud. Using a blower also gives you the best possible airflow through any shroud you decide to use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition - in my experience - adding having two or more fans blowing on the model from different directions will further improve overhang performance.

Whether dealing with acetone, xylene, toluene, mineral spirits or a standard petroleum distillate, the safety precautions are all very similar. Here are the recommended safety precautions for the handling of acetone:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Wear gloves at a minimum to protect your hands, preferably wear a smock in addition to the gloves to prevent damage to your clothing (acetone is a great solvent!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Wear safety goggles. Acetone in your eye is not an experience you want to have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- You should be wearing a vapor respirator rated to protect against acetone. Although, it would not be uncommon for this to be ignored without consequence in the short term. Long term exposure without a mask may cause cancer or other nastiness though, so don't think the mask is just an overkill. Get a mask if you like your brain cells!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Prepare and know how to use an eyewash station, a fire blanket, a chemical shower/dousing system and other standard laboratory safety equipment.&#xD;&#xA;Ensure proper ventilation of your workspace. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- As a volatile organic compound, acetone vaporizes quite quickly at room temperature. Without a venting of those fumes, they can build up to dangerous levels. Displacement of oxygen and nitrogen from the air is bad enough, but as acetone is a hydrocarbon, it is also a fire and explosion risk at certain concentrations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Eliminate any and all sources of flame or spark. If you are a smoker that is not allowed while working around acetone. Additionally, do not smoke during breaks from your work either, unless you take special precautions to ensure you are not soaked in acetone. If your sleeve accidentally becomes soaked in acetone and you light a cigarette there is a good chance for bad burns from a sudden flash over involving your flesh.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Do not under any condition mix your acetone with these chemicals, as you will be synthesizing an explosive: hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, nitric acid, nitric acid + sulfuric acid, chromic anydride, chromyl&#xD;&#xA;chloride, nitrosyl chloride, hexachloromelamine, nitrosyl perchlorate, nitryl perchlorate, permonosulfuric acid, thiodiglycol +&#xD;&#xA;hydrogen peroxide, potassium ter-butoxide, sulfur dichloride, 1-methyl-1,3-butadiene, bromoform, carbon, air, chloroform,&#xD;&#xA;thitriazylperchlorate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Keep an inert and highly volumetric absorption media readily available to cleanup spills. Diatomaceous earth, silica/sand and activated charcoal are all potential absorption media.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Take care not to expose acetone to any other chemicals or to any surfaces which you are not sure do not react. An acetone spill could easily mean thousands of dollars in repairs depending on what it touches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Read the entirety of the [Material Safety Data Sheet for acetone][1]. Generally speaking the MSDS is the first reference you should consult if you want to learn the needed safety precautions for handling and usage of a chemical. Acetone is no exemption, and the MSDS is even more comprehensive on the dangers than I have been with this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927062" />

A buildup of acetone gas could quickly get concentrated, meaning that a single spark could lead to disaster. Using a fan is good; angle it towards an open window. This is also to prevent exposure to acetone because of its toxicity.&#xD;&#xA; - **[Be prepared to fight a fire.](http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927062)** Should vapor ignite, you may need to fight the fire. If it is large enough, then you should clearly evacuate the area. If it appears to be small, use dry chemical powder to snuff out the fire. Alcohol foam, water spray, and/or fog may be used on slightly larger fires. Acetone is not likely to cause a large inferno to rip through the building. But there's always the chance of a small fire. Be careful.&#xD;&#xA; - **[Create a vapor chamber.](https://rivercitylabs.org/acetone-smoothing-chamber-3d-printing/)** This is another way to stop a potential fire from spreading. It can also reduce contamination.&#xD;&#xA; - **Wear gloves.** This can minimize any potential transfer toxic effects. However, skin exposure is unlikely to cause major issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Acetone is toxic, as I mentioned before, but it is not highly toxic. Exposure via [the eyes and nose/mouth](http://ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/chem_profiles/acetone.html) is the main risk. Skin effects may occur (e.g. mild irritation), but they are minor and generally arise only after long-term exposure (hence the recommendation of gloves in some cases).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Acetone exposure is only a serious problem when a person is repeatedly exposed to levels [greater than 1,000 ppm](http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/67641.html) (severe effects only arise at much higher levels). It seems unlikely, given a proper ventilation system, that this will be an issue&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to all this, basic safety precautions such as wearing a ventilator mask and goggles should definitely be taken. When working with any such chemicals with the potential for bodily harm, these should absolutely be used." />

You agree to hold me harmless and not sue me as a result of using these instructions/advice. If you don't agree to that, do not use these instructions/advice. Remember I am not a professional chemist or a lawyer!***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When dealing with volatile organic compound (for example: acetone, xylene, toluene, mineral spirits, standard or light petroleum distillates) safety measures must be taken. I encourage you to research safety precautions and risks on your own to build a personal body of knowledge. The most effective safety precaution available to you is knowledge; the brain is the most important piece of safety equipment! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Safety Equipment**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Wear safety clothing! Acetone requires that you wear protective gloves, protective eyewear, and a respirator (to protect your airway). It is also highly recommended to wear protective (ideally also chemically resistant) clothing (like a smock or an apron). These safety clothes are recommended because acetone is a toxic substance which can absorb through the skin and walls of the lungs directly. Make sure to verify the gloves are made of a substance which blocks acetone absorption, also, verify that your respirator is rated to protect against acetone (many respirators are not capable of blocking acetone due to it's volatility).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Possess, prepare and understand how to use an eyewash station, a fire blanket, a fire extinguisher (rated for chemical fires), a chemical shower/dousing system and other standard laboratory safety equipment. Posting warning signs along the entrances and exits to the work area about working with a volatile, flammable and explosive gas is also recommended.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Keep an inert absorption media readily available to cleanup spills should you accidentally fail to avoid a spill. Diatomaceous earth, silica/sand and activated charcoal are all potential absorption media. Should you have a large spill or not possess absorption media (which should not happen - always verify safety equipment is present and working before handling chemicals!) then you may also dilute the spill with water and mop up the dilute solution of acetone. No matter which method you use to cleanup a spill remember to dispose of the contaminated cleanup materials according to the requirements/laws of your local area. **Do not** lazily dispose of the acetone down the drain without doing research on the correct disposal methods!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Control Your Environment**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Ensure proper ventilation of your workspace (ventilation is required in addition to your respirator due to explosion/fire risk). If the atmospheric concentration of acetone becomes too high the risk for fires and explosions quickly becomes unacceptable (the risk is never going to be zero working with acetone unfortunately, but minimizing it is very important). Working outside is the perfect way to insure the ventilation is adequate, although that presents it's own problems and considerations. Alternatives include using a fume hood, or even something as simple as a fan blowing air through an open window. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Eliminate any and all sources of flame or spark for a considerable area around all sources of acetone (30-40 feet minimum). Take special precautions to prevent being unknowingly contaminated with acetone (which could then be accidentally transported from the work area to a flame source using you as a carrier). Personal contamination can lead to injury if you attempt to smoke during a break or at anytime before verifying you are not contaminated. It is important to provide an ignition-free environment that extends quite far away from the immediate vicinity of the acetone because acetone can ignite a vapor trail of acetone and allow the flame to travel distances via flashing over the vapor trail. Physical isolation is the ideal solution to this dangerous problem. A policy of always closing the door to the acetone work area is an example of physical separation would would hopefully prevent this vapor trail flash-over.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Avoid acetone spills. Acetone is an excellent solvent which could easily eat away the paint on your wall or destroy the finish of your table. Spills also necessitate following special precautions for cleanup and disposal, which have already been provided earlier within this list. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Learn and Understanding The Chemistry**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Read the entirety of the [Material Safety Data Sheet for acetone][1]. Until you read the entire MSDS for acetone you cannot possibly be ready to handle the chemical! MSDS are required by federal law for all chemicals; if you need to learn the safety problems for a particular chemical simply read it's MSDS. This acetone MSDS was generated by the &quot;Sciencelab.com, Inc.&quot; company. An MSDS is only as trustworthy as the chemist or company that created it, so if you don't trust &quot;Sciencelab.com, Inc.&quot; please read another acetone MSDS.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Do not under any condition mix your acetone with chemicals without an extensive analysis of the products and the risks associated with the reaction. The following list of chemicals will create an explosive compound/mixture when reacted with acetone, so do not allow them to come into contact with acetone: hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, nitric acid, nitric acid + sulfuric acid, chromic anydride, chromyl&#xD;&#xA;chloride, nitrosyl chloride, hexachloromelamine, nitrosyl perchlorate, nitryl perchlorate, permonosulfuric acid, thiodiglycol +&#xD;&#xA;hydrogen peroxide, potassium ter-butoxide, sulfur dichloride, 1-methyl-1,3-butadiene, bromoform, carbon, air, chloroform,&#xD;&#xA;thitriazylperchlorate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Risk Analysis**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Acetone is a confirmed developmental toxin for females and a suspected developmental toxin for males as well. The risk of breast milk contamination is unknown, but it is a suspected toxic contaminant. Mutagenic and tetragenic effects are not known.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The risk of cancer and the carcinogenic properties for acetone are not well-defined, with some declining to classify acetone as a carcinogen and others classifying it as being carcinogenic. California,for instance, has required that acetone bear a proposition 65 warning about cancer risk.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Acetone is definitely a toxic substance, but it is not highly toxic and accidental ingestion or absorption is essentially incapable of causing severe symptoms. Small exposures to acetone (like the exposure levels likely encountered during 3D printing) are more-or-less not very harmful. However, if you do get a problematic exposure to acetone, contact a poison control center.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The LD50 (dose required for the death of 50% of subjects) in rats is 5800mg/kg, making the predicted LD50 for an adult human very high. With such a high lethal dose, the predicted toxicity of acetone likely causes chronic sub-lethal damage. To estimate the human LD50, lets assume an average adult human (62 kg) shares the LD50 of a rat- that human would need to consume 392cc of acetone for a 50% chance at a lethal dose. 392cc is nearly equivalent to 4/10 of a liter- meaning that there is essentially no chance the small consumption of acetone caused by working with it could poison an adult human (if our assumptions are correct).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Potential effects of inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption of acetone: dry skin, nausea, vomiting, skin irritation, eye irritation, burning sensation, redness, tearing, inflammation, corneal injury, depression, fatigue, excitement, stupor, insomnia, hypersomnia, ataxia, tremors, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, headache, muscle weakness, loss of motor coordination, speech abnormalities, narcotic effects, coma, kidney damage, liver damage, brain damage, death.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927062" />

Alternatives include using a fume hood, or even something as simple as a fan blowing air through an open window. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Eliminate any and all sources of flame or spark for a considerable area around all sources of acetone (10-15 meters minimum). Take special precautions to prevent being unknowingly contaminated with acetone (which could then be accidentally transported from the work area to a flame source using you as a carrier). Personal contamination can lead to injury if you attempt to smoke during a break or at anytime before verifying you are not contaminated.

Acetone is a hydrocarbon and the reaction of burning it produces products which include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Essentially, humans are incapable of detecting either gas with their senses (detectors exist to measure concentration). However, these symptoms of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide can help alert you to the fact they are present: shortness of breath, blackness along the edges of your vision, confusion, headache, unconsciousness, coma, and finally, death. Carbon monoxide is far more dangerous than carbon dioxide because often the first symptom is unconsciousness, which prevents you from evacuating, leading to death. The dangerous of gas inhalation are substantial enough that as soon as a fire becomes medium-sized you should seriously consider evacuating the area rather than staying to extinguish the fire. It is better to lose property to the fire than to die (if you die I would guess that your property is destroyed anyway!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Risk Analysis**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Acetone is a confirmed developmental toxin for females and a suspected developmental toxin for males as well. The risk of breast milk contamination is unknown, but it is a suspected toxic contaminant. Mutagenic and tetragenic effects are not known. The result of this toxicity is that pregnant or breastfeeding women should not handle or be around acetone (due to vapors) even for short periods of time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The risk of cancer and the carcinogenic properties for acetone are not well-defined, with some declining to classify acetone as a carcinogen and others classifying it as being carcinogenic. California, for instance, has required that acetone bear a proposition 65 warning about cancer risk.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Acetone is definitely a toxic substance, but it is not highly toxic and accidental ingestion or absorption is essentially incapable of causing severe symptoms.

Generally, the differences are minimal, however:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Generally speaking, a 1.75mm filament will make it easier to use a smaller nozzle diameter (&lt;0.4mm), allowing for more precise prints in some cases.&#xD;&#xA; - 1.75mm filament will give you better flexibility with flow rates as it has a higher surface to volume ratio, allowing for faster melting in the nozzle, and allowing you to push your printer to higher volume extrusion rates.&#xD;&#xA; - The converse of the above points is also usually true. &quot;3mm&quot; filament (which is usually actually 2.85mm) will allow for better control and higher extrusion rates on wider nozzle diameters.&#xD;&#xA; - 1.75mm filament is indeed more popular than 2.85mm, however the smaller diameter means that manufacturing tolerances really need to be tighter along the length of the filament—a ±0.1mm difference in width along the length of your filament is only ±3.5% for 2.85mm and more like ±6.7% for 1.75mm, so you're going to have a bigger difference in actual flow rates compared to your expected flow rate set in your slicer, resulting in lower-than-expected print quality. That means you're probably going to want to spring for more expensive, higher quality 1.75mm filament in order to get good prints.&#xD;&#xA; - Your printer's hardware setup matters, too: Bowden-based printers, like the Ultimaker 2, generally have more luck with the thicker filament because thinner stuff will usually compress more in the bowden tube and create a stronger spring effect, causing extra pressure in the nozzle. This will often cause blobbing, stringing, and over-extrusion and hamper the positive effect of your retractions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately, you can tune your printer and slicer settings to create or negate most any of the differences in print quality caused by filament diameter, but you may have an easier time with certain prints and printers with one diameter over the other." />

By using this advice you agree to hold me harmless and not sue me as a result of using these instructions/advice. Remember that I am not a professional chemist or a lawyer (this isn't professional or legal advice)!***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I encourage you to research safety precautions and risks on your own to build a personal body of knowledge. The most effective safety precaution available to you is knowledge; the brain is the most important piece of safety equipment! This listing of advice for acetone handling is generated from the highlights of a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for acetone. After reading this advice you should read an MSDS for acetone directly. It would actually be an excellent idea to find and read the MSDS for all the chemicals you use during 3D printing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Safety Equipment**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Wear safety clothing! Acetone requires that you wear protective gloves, protective eyewear, and a respirator (to protect your airway). It is also highly recommended to wear protective (ideally also chemically resistant) clothing (like a smock or an apron). These safety clothes are recommended because acetone is a toxic substance which can absorb through the skin and walls of the lungs directly. Make sure to verify the gloves are made of a substance which blocks acetone absorption, also, verify that your respirator is rated to protect against acetone (many respirators are not capable of blocking acetone due to it's volatility).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Possess, prepare and understand how to use an eyewash station, a fire blanket, a fire extinguisher (rated for chemical fires), a chemical shower/dousing system and other standard laboratory safety equipment. Posting warning signs along the entrances and exits to the work area about working with a volatile, flammable and explosive gas is also recommended.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Keep an inert absorption media readily available to cleanup spills should you accidentally fail to avoid a spill. Diatomaceous earth, silica/sand and activated charcoal are all potential absorption media. Should you have a large spill or not possess absorption media (which should not happen - always verify safety equipment is present and working before handling chemicals!) then you may also dilute the spill with water and mop up the dilute solution of acetone. No matter which method you use to cleanup a spill remember to dispose of the contaminated cleanup materials according to the requirements/laws of your local area. **Do not** lazily dispose of the acetone down the drain without doing research on the correct disposal methods!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Control Your Environment**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Ensure proper ventilation of your workspace (ventilation is required in addition to your respirator due to explosion/fire risk). If the atmospheric concentration of acetone becomes too high the risk for fires and explosions quickly becomes unacceptable (the risk is never going to be zero working with acetone unfortunately, but minimizing it is very important). Working outside is the perfect way to insure the ventilation is adequate, although that presents it's own problems and considerations. Alternatives include using a fume hood, or even something as simple as a fan blowing air through an open window. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Eliminate any and all sources of flame or spark for a considerable area around all sources of acetone (10-15 meters minimum). Take special precautions to prevent being unknowingly contaminated with acetone (which could then be accidentally transported from the work area to a flame source using you as a carrier). Personal contamination can lead to injury if you attempt to smoke during a break or at anytime before verifying you are not contaminated. It is important to provide an ignition-free environment that extends quite far away from the immediate vicinity of the acetone because acetone can ignite a vapor trail of acetone and allow the flame to travel distances via flashing over the vapor trail. Physical isolation is the ideal solution to this dangerous problem. A policy of always closing the door to the acetone work area is an example of physical separation which would hopefully prevent this vapor trail flash-over.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Avoid acetone spills. Acetone is an excellent solvent which could easily eat away the paint on your wall or destroy the finish of your table. Spills also necessitate following special precautions for cleanup and disposal, which have already been provided earlier within this list. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Acetone Chemistry**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Do not under any condition mix your acetone with chemicals without an extensive analysis and understanding of the products and the risks associated with the reaction. The following list of chemicals will create an explosive compound/mixture when reacted with acetone, so do not allow them to come into contact with acetone: hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, nitric acid, nitric acid + sulfuric acid, chromic anydride, chromyl&#xD;&#xA;chloride, nitrosyl chloride, hexachloromelamine, nitrosyl perchlorate, nitryl perchlorate, permonosulfuric acid, thiodiglycol +&#xD;&#xA;hydrogen peroxide, potassium ter-butoxide, sulfur dichloride, 1-methyl-1,3-butadiene, bromoform, carbon, air, chloroform,&#xD;&#xA;thitriazylperchlorate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Should you accidentally ignite some acetone, you must take additional precautions while evacuating or while attempting to extinguish the fire. Acetone is a hydrocarbon and the reaction of burning it produces products which include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Essentially, humans are incapable of detecting these gases with their senses (detectors exist to measure concentration). However, these symptoms of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide can help alert you to the fact they are present: shortness of breath, blackness along the edges of your vision, confusion, headache, unconsciousness, coma, and finally, death. Carbon monoxide is far more dangerous than carbon dioxide because often the first symptom is unconsciousness, which prevents you from evacuating, leading to death. The dangerous of gas inhalation are substantial enough that as soon as a fire becomes medium-sized you should seriously consider evacuating the area rather than staying to extinguish the fire. It is better to lose property to the fire than to die (if you die I would guess that your property is destroyed anyway!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Risk Analysis**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Acetone is a confirmed developmental toxin for females and a suspected developmental toxin for males as well. The risk of breast milk contamination is unknown, but it is a suspected toxic contaminant. Mutagenic and tetragenic effects are not known. The result of this toxicity is that pregnant or breastfeeding women should not handle or be around acetone (due to vapors) even for short periods of time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The risk of cancer and the carcinogenic properties for acetone are not well-defined, with some declining to classify acetone as a carcinogen and others classifying it as being carcinogenic. California, for instance, has required that acetone bear a proposition 65 warning about cancer risk.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Acetone is definitely a toxic substance, but it is not highly toxic and accidental ingestion or absorption is essentially incapable of causing severe symptoms. Small exposures to acetone (like the exposure levels likely encountered during 3D printing) are more-or-less not very harmful. However, if you do get a problematic exposure to acetone, contact a poison control center.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The LD50 (&quot;lethal dose 50%&quot;, dose where half of subjects die) in rats is 5800 mg/kg, making the predictable (humans are often similar to rats in regards to toxicity) LD50 for an adult human similarly high. With such a high lethal dose, the predicted toxicity of acetone likely causes chronic sub-lethal damage instead of causing an acute and lethal response. If we assume an average adult human (62 kg) shares the LD50 of a rat- that human would need to consume 392 cc of acetone to reach the LD50. 392 cc is nearly equivalent to 4/10 L- meaning that there is essentially no chance the small consumption of acetone caused by working with it could poison an adult human (if our assumptions are correct).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - *Potential effects of inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption of acetone:* dry skin, nausea, vomiting, skin irritation, eye irritation, burning sensation, redness, tearing, inflammation, corneal injury, depression, fatigue, excitement, stupor, insomnia, hypersomnia, ataxia, tremors, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, headache, muscle weakness, loss of motor coordination, speech abnormalities, narcotic effects, coma, kidney damage, liver damage, brain damage, and death.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927062" />

Other (albeit traditional) manufacturing methods such as a mill will typically require post-processing to parts to remove any burrs and clean the parts. Since tools like a mill are a subtractive technology, it can already hold tight positional/dimensional tolerances. However, as 3D printing is additive manufacturing, it's difficult to hold the same tolerances directly out of the machine as compared to traditional tools.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this reason, I would suggest planning time for a more traditional process after the print if tolerances and connections are a concern.

Some printers have a pause capability, while others do not. Some have multiple extruders, while most do not. Some have a tube leading to the extruder and others do not. You specifically are asking about dealing with more than two colors when you have a dual-extruder, but the question generalizes to how to get more colors than you have extruders.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Markers probably offer the easiest solution. You could have different markers on the feeds for each extruder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For printers with no pause ability, you might have to snip one filament and hand feed the second color after the first one until it can be caught by the feeder gear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are rigs that are available, or that you can make, that will let you connect two strands together lengthwise. You can then make up a single piece of filament that has multiple colors. Thus, one extruder head will be generating multiple colors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Kickstarter mentioned elsewhere essentially does this automatically for several strands whose lengths are calculated precisely by special software. The result is a single strand of filament that goes into one of your extruders - the other extruder would be unused with this solution." />

They're literally just a pair of wires made from two different special alloys, electrically connected together at the &quot;hot&quot; end. That wire junction can be mounted inside whatever kind of attachment tip or lug is desired.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact that they're very simple and passive devices makes them extremely precise and consistent between TCs of the same type, MUCH more so than thermistors. Any type-K thermocouple in the world will give you the same accurate output +/-1-2C or so. You can even cut a thermocouple in half, re-twist the ends of the wires together, and it'll still work! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the very small (millivolts) signal they generate is quite susceptible to electrical noise and circuit design. The signal voltage has to be greatly amplified to be useful. So it doesn't take much EMR from your heater or stepper wires to interfere with the TC reading. A frequent problem with TC circuits in 3d printers is the dreaded GROUND LOOP -- if the &quot;hot&quot; tip is electrically connected to the hot block, voltage and current on the heater and motor wires can induce small currents through the TC wires that totally screw up the millivolt signal. The amplifier picks up these stray voltages and it throws off the temp read. So, there are some important guidelines for keeping noise out of the TC wires:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The TC wires must be electrically insulated from the mounting hardware (eye lug, thermowell, whatever your extruder has). You can check this with a multimeter -- you want infinite / out of range resistance from the TC leads to the mounting tip and hot block. While you're at it, make sure your heater cartridge wires aren't shorting to the hot block -- that's unsafe and can also cause problems with TCs.&#xD;&#xA; - Keep the two TC wires close together, and not immediately parallel to noise sources like PWM-controlled heaters or stepper wiring. If you must run the TC in a bundle with the other wires, TWIST the heater/stepper wiring pairs. (For steppers, twist each coil pair to a different pitch if possible. You don't need to twist the separate coil pairs to each other.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another common issue with TC circuits is the COLD JUNCTION COMPENSATION. A thermocouple doesn't measure tip temperature, it measures the DIFFERENCE in temperature between the hot tip and the cold junction where the TC is connected to either the amp or copper wiring. The TC amp has an onboard thermistor that it uses to add the temp at the cold junction to the measured signal from the thermocouple. There are a few things you need to do to make sure the cold-junction compensation works properly:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - You should run TC wire all the way from the &quot;hot&quot; tip to the TC amp. You CAN splice it and install plugs, but only with more type-K TC wire and proper type-K thermocouple plugs. These use the same metal as the TC wire so they don't generate undesired junction voltages that interfere with the TC signal. If you splice copper wire between the TC and the amp, any temp differences along the copper will not be measured! This is a particularly big problem if you splice to copper inside a warm enclosure and then run copper to an amp outside the enclosure.&#xD;&#xA; - The amp should not be super hot. The onboard thermistor is designed to accurately measure temperatures reasonably close to room temp, not hot-block temps. &#xD;&#xA; - There should not be large temperature gradients near the amp or between the TC wire termination and the actual amp chip. Place the amp far enough away from the hot end and other heat sources (like stepper motors) that it isn't experiencing weird temp profiles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do the above, the TC will output a good signal, and the amp will read it properly. But there's one more hitch. The mainboard has to know how to understand the amp's output. 3D printer control boards that are designed exclusively for TCs, like Mightyboards, usually use digital communication between the amp and the main control chip (MCU). This is high-reliability and does not require any special firmware configuration -- support is baked in. But if you're strapping an external TC amp onto a board that is expecting thermistors, **you will have to tell the firmware how to read the signal from the amp.** The most common technique is for the amp to output a linear voltage signal to the MCU's normal thermistor input (ADC). Then you configure the firmware to use the appropriate &quot;thermistor table&quot; (really a voltage lookup table) for that particular amp. Depending on your controller board, you also may need to make sure the regular thermistor pull-up/pull-down resistors aren't affecting the amp's output.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So you need to make sure:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - You don't have electrical noise issues&#xD;&#xA; - The cold-junction compensation is working as intended&#xD;&#xA; - The firmware and controller board is configured correctly for your amp chip's output&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do all that, a TC should give superior accuracy and reliability over a thermistor.

There's a lot of software-specific advice out there, like printing a single-wall calibration box and measuring the wall thickness. That's a good technique for Slic3r, but not for Simplify3D. It can be very confusing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's the general outline of what you should do:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **Rough calibration check** for printer steps/mm. Do the values in your firmware settings make sense for your linear motion hardware? For example, you can calculate what the theoretical values SHOULD be based on belt pitch and pulley tooth count. Print something moderately big (~100-200mm) and check if it's +/-1-2%. If it's off by more than that, your steps/mm is probably wrong.&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Check for mechanical backlash** using a backlash-checking print like this one: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:252490 Tighten belts and perform other printer-specific tuning required to eliminate backlash. Backlash will throw off other calibration steps, so make sure there's no slop!&#xD;&#xA; 3. Follow the recommended **extrusion volume calibration** steps for your slicer. This starts with measuring your filament diameter with calipers and inputting that into your slicer. And then you will usually either *&quot;print a single-walled box and measure the thickness&quot;* or *&quot;print a series of 100% infill calibration boxes and adjust the extrusion multiplier to the largest value that looks good without bulging.&quot;* By measuring filament diameter and then adjusting an extrusion calibration setting in the slicer, you will be able to measure future filament and prints will come out right. Giving the slicer fake diameter values will force you to recalibrate every time the diameter changes. Note that you must redo this calibration for each FILAMENT MATERIAL and EXTRUDER DESIGN. Different material/extruder pairs will have different bite depths and effective drive diameter.&#xD;&#xA; 4. **Precision calibration check** by printing a variety of object sizes and PLOTTING &quot;desired size&quot; as X and &quot;actual size&quot; as Y. Then find a linear fit equation, y=mx+b. (Do this separately for your printer's X, Y, and Z axes.) *The value &quot;m&quot; is your scale error.* You can use your slicer object scaling to fix this. For example, ABS usually requires 100.3-101% scaling to account for shrinkage. If you have scale error with a low-shrinkage material like PLA, you can adjust your firmware's steps/mm value to compensate. *The value &quot;b&quot; is your fixed width error.* Assuming you don't have backlash, this is usually caused by the small amount that molten plastic bulges out to the sides, or by extrusion volume calibration error. You can improve this by fine-tuning your extrusion volume. Many slicers also have &quot;horizontal/XY size compensation&quot; settings that you can use to shrink/expand the part by b/2 to correct the fixed width error. Any residual fixed-width error that you cannot correct with slicer settings should be added as a tolerance in your part models. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you follow these steps, you should get +/-0.1mm or better dimensional precision on your prints.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Deltas not included. That's a whole other ball of wax. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

It just needs to be tuned well.** The smallest &quot;must have&quot; feature in a standard lego brick is the 1.6mm thick wall around the sides. The typical minimum printable feature size for an FFF printer is 2x the extrusion width, because the slicer will place a path on the inside edge of the shape and the outside edge of the shape. (Some slicers will allow single-extrusion features, but this is not generally recommended because it makes weak parts.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, how wide is the extrusion width? It's adjustable, and different slicers auto-recommend different values, but as a safe rule of thumb it needs to be between 1x and 2x your nozzle size. There are some volume calculation quirks in different slicers that may encourage larger or smaller sizes, so sometimes people recommend [extrusion width = nozzle size + layer height] particularly with Slic3r. This is very system-specific. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming you have the most common stock nozzle with a 0.4mm orifice, and also set the extrusion width to 0.4mm, the slicer should put four strands in the walls of the LEGO brick. That's good. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where it gets tricky is if you have an extrusion width that does not evenly divide into 1.6mm. Say you are printing with an extrusion width of 0.6mm. There is enough room in the wall of the part to place two full 0.6mm perimeter strands... but then a gap 0.4mm wide will be left in the center. You can't put another 0.6mm strand into that 0.4mm gap. Different slicers handle this different ways. Some will leave an empty space between the walls, and you get a very weak print. Some will mash an excessive amount of plastic into the gap, causing poor print quality as excess material builds up more and more on each layer. Some will push a smaller-than-commanded strand to try to properly fill the volume. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the general advice with small features is to make sure your extrusion width goes into the part's minimum thickness a reasonable number of times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Feature size / extrusion width &lt; 2] is BAD  &#xD;&#xA; - [Feature size / extrusion width = 2] is GOOD &#xD;&#xA; - [2 &lt; Feature size / extrusion width &lt; 3] is BAD &#xD;&#xA; - [Feature size / extrusion width &gt; 3] is GOOD&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although these will vary somewhat by slicer -- older slicers like Skeinforge tend to have more issues with this than newer slicers. What you should do in practice is check your slicer's print previewer to see whether it is leaving a gap between the strands. Then adjust extrusion width and perimeter/shell count to try to get an intelligent output. There's some trial and error involved." />

You can't just open a window to air out the molten-ABS smell from the ISS! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;FFF printers put out fumes and nanoparticles. In a space station, the same air gets recycled over and over, and the air purification systems have a specific set of contaminants that they are optimized for, as well as a design capacity for air turnover and chemical removal rates that won't be adjusted just because somebody's printing a space-ratchet today. Protecting cabin air quality is a huge design factor for any experiment that goes into space.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Made in Space printing experiments on the ISS to date were performed in one of the vacuum experiment chambers, so any unfiltered fumes (or fire flare-ups) could be vented directly to space if required. In the long run, this isn't going to work -- other experiments may need the vacuum chamber, or &quot;production&quot; printers may be too large to fit. So the printer needs to have its own internal air purification system. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another MAJOR design constraint is launch survival. Rocket payloads must be designed for extreme g-forces without 1) damage, or 2) significant internal shifting of mass which would affect the payload center of gravity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Total payload weight is also quite important here: lifting mass to low Earth orbit is EXPENSIVE. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Surprisingly, the microgravity environment itself isn't that big of a deal. Molten plastic is highly viscous and pretty much stays where you put it long enough to solidify, as long as it's sticking to something. But two impacts do come to mind. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - First, an unsecured filament spool will try to unwind itself. Gravity won't provide the contact friction we usually rely on to keep spools from bird's-nesting. (Think about it: a tightly-wound spool is literally a giant coil-spring.) &#xD;&#xA; - Second, heat flows are different in microgravity -- you can't rely on passive convection to cool the print or the motors. Accommodations must be made for sufficient forced airflow and heat-sinking on anything that requires cooling. And that includes the enclosure itself, since, as mentioned above, the print chamber must be sealed up tight for air quality control. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, reliability is critical. Amazon doesn't deliver to the ISS (yet). Even a single stripped screw may take the printer out of commission for months until a replacement part can be fit into an upcoming supply launch. Having the printer catch on fire because something shorted would be catastrophic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, really, it's all about making a printer robust enough to make it up there, operate safely, and never break. Printing upside-down is trivial in comparison. " />

Make sure that the **bed is level**. As the saying goes, a level bed is next to godliness or something like that.

[This can be done with just one nozzle and a business card or piece of paper](http://wiki.solidoodle.com/leveling-the-print-bed).&#xA; 2. Use a **bubble level** to get the nozzles about right. Move your z-axis up a bit and put a bubble level against the nozzles. Adjust as necessary so it's exactly level. The nozzles should be level enough that the bubble stays in the middle.&#xA; 3. Fine-tune it with a **business card**. When you home the z- axis, you should be able to just fit a business card under both nozzles with a moderate amount of resistance. Don't force the card. If sliding the business card under produces a different amount of resistance for one nozzle than for another, adjust the nozzle a *tiny* amount. You can also use an index card or playing card.&#xA; 4. Once it passes the card test, try a test print. If it doesn't work, make sure your bed is level, your nozzle offset is correct in the slicing software, and try calibrating with an index card again. If the nozzles become way off, try the bubble level again.&#xA;&#xA;As for physically adjusting the level, another answer suggests shims made from aluminum foil, which work well.

It will &quot;work&quot; in the sense that your printer will get power, but it won't provide anywhere near as much protection as a lower-rated fuse. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;10A is a lot of current for mains voltage. Depending on what else you have plugged in, there is a fair chance your home's 15A breaker will trip before this fuse does, which kind of defeats the point of having it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even for &quot;fast&quot; fuses, it takes a significant amount of time for them to blow when conducting their rated current. The internal fusible link has to heat up and melt before the fuse stops conducting. The less the overload current exceeds the rating, the longer that takes. A 10A fuse conducting a 10.5A short might take 30 seconds to trip. In the meantime, your printer is melting. Lower-rated fuses will trip faster for the same short and thus provide better protection. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*You need to size fuses as small as possible for the required current draw if you want to have any hope of rapidly cutting off an excessive-current event.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would recommend a 4A fuse in the USA for this 350w power supply. (Note: the listing title says 360 but the photos show 350.) I use 4A fuses in several printers with 120v / 350w PSUs and they do not trip. But you can do the math for yourself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;350 watts / 120 volts / 80% efficiency = 3.64A&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The smallest fuse you can find that is larger than this value is what you should use. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, we can argue over whether 80% is the right efficiency value... it could be lower. The PSU label says 6.5A input is required, but that amount of current draw implies either a &lt;50% efficiency (which is quite poor for this kind of PSU) or would only occur for abuse/surge scenarios like starting very large motors. Such short-lived inrush events generally won't trip a fuse unless you do something dumb like lock the rotor. And none of that applies to the small microstepping-driver stepper motor systems we're working with here. This PSU should not draw more than 4A in normal 3D printer use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at this on the other end -- how much damage will 10A do versus 4A? Lots. If the short is in the 12v system, and the PSU's short protection doesn't trip in (because it's a cheap knock-off) you would roughly multiply the AC fuse current times 10 to get the DC current. And 40A is a downright scary amount of current! Depending on wire gauge, putting 40A through heatbed wiring may make it smell and smoke. Whereas putting 100A through heatbed wiring will almost certainly start a fire. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You're much safer with a 4A or even 6A fuse for this PSU than a 10A fuse. " />

(http://www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au/)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most &quot;consumer&quot; SLA printers these days use bottom-up-and-peel techniques, because this has some practical advantages over top-down printers:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Way less resin is required to fill the printer when the part is pulled out as it builds rather than being lowered into the tank (along with the Z stage) as it builds. Resin is expensive. This also means bottom up printers can be smaller and have fewer mechanical parts such as leveling devices submerged in resin. &#xD;&#xA; - Standard resins contain an inhibitor chemical that prevents polymerization in the presence of oxygen, which causes the surface layer exposed to air (and low-level stray light) to not cure. So top-down printers must shoot light through a non-curing layer before reaching curable resin. This makes the tuning more sensitive and can somewhat reduce detail compared to a bottom-up printer curing right on the window.&#xD;&#xA; - Replacement vats or windows for bottom-up printers may be seen by manufacturers as a profit-generating consumable, since they have to be replaced somewhat frequently.&#xD;&#xA; - Top-down printers have to worry somewhat more about resin flow rates as the part is lowered. Air bubbles may be pulled into the resin or the fresh resin layer above the part may vary significantly in thickness if the part is submerged too fast for the resin viscosity. (Admittedly, bottom-up printers will experience excessive suction forces and potentially break off bits of the print at high peel speeds.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;CLIP is a bottom-up technique that doesn't require a peel step, because the vat creates an oxygen layer over the window that keeps the resin from curing directly on the surface and sticking. In that way, it arguably performs more like a top-down printer than a bottom-up printer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Top-down printers that are designed to overcome the above issues and use high-intensity light sources can achieve exceptionally high print speeds. This includes similar &quot;continuous&quot; build techniques used as in CLIP." />

The Creator line is a very popular set of printers, so there is lots of good advice out there. The FlashForge Google Group is a good community to join: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flashforge&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The entire FF Creator line, in turn, is cloned from the original Makerbot Replicator 1. So you can use Makerbot slicing profiles for the Replicator 1. Just keep in mind that Makerbot does not generally test new software revs with their older printers, and DEFINITELY does not test new software revs with competitor knock-offs. Sometimes they appear to break functionality for non-Makerbot machines on purpose. So recent versions of Makerbot Desktop may not &quot;play nice&quot; with your FlashForge. **The most recent &quot;known good&quot; free slicer you should use with this printer is Makerware 2.4.x. You can find links by searching the FF Google Group.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On that note, you may have received instructions to use ReplicatorG with your printer. But RepG is abandonware: development stopped years ago. It should only be used for firmware updates, not as a slicer. You should also only use the most recent version posted on the Sailfish page on Thingiverse: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using older versions of RepG with newer firmware revs will corrupt your EEPROM! Only use the version downloaded from the link above. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The firmware that comes with the printer is FlashForge's slightly-customized build of either Sailfish or Makerbot's Replicator 1/2/2x firmware. But here's the trick: Makerbot's Rep1/2/2x firmware is just an old, out-of-date, slightly customized version of Sailfish. Makerbot stopped keeping up with bug-fixes and feature additions a long time ago. **Everything is Sailfish:** just different versions. You should use the most recent official release version listed at:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.sailfishfirmware.com/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Follow the instructions in the Sailfish manual from the link above, and RepG will automatically pull the right builds from the official mirror and populate a list of printer options to choose. The trick here is which build to download. As of 1-21-16, there is not an official Monoprice Architect build yet. Which would mean editing a machine xml profile to avoid the firmware throwing warnings. I STRONGLY recommend getting used to the printer using factory firmware before trying to fight with custom machine profiles... But here is the basic process to pick a Sailfish firmware build when you're ready:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First: which Atmega processor version do you have? The large chip in the middle of the control board will either say 1280 or 2560. You need to know which version you have. Bad things happen if you load the wrong version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second: What is the tooth count on the X and Y drivetrain pulleys? To my knowledge, FF always uses 17-tooth pulleys, which matches the Replicator 1 and FF Creator profiles. The Rep2 and 2x use 18t pulleys, so only use those builds if you have those pulleys. People often mess this up and their prints end up with dimensions ~5% off in X and Y. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third: The Architect has one extruder and no heatbed, so firmware builds that expect those to be connected (Rep 1 Dual, Creator, etc) will throw errors if loaded. You can fix this from the LCD screen or RepG, but that's a whole separate question. Do some printing and learn about the printer before attempting any firmware update so you'll know what to do if you pick a build with the wrong parts. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fourth: This one is just for the sake of completeness. Some FF models were shipped with off-spec heatbeds that require special firmware builds to prevent drawing too much current and overheating / overloading the power supply. The Architect doesn't have that, but firmware builds for those printer models (eg I believe the FF Creator 2560) will under-power regular heatbeds. This is just something you need to know with the Architect if you decide to install a heatbed later. But it's a really critical safety warning for people with those off-spec heatbeds. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this all seems complicated, that's because FlashForge (and in turn Monoprice) relies heavily on the open source Sailfish project to maintain the software ecosystem behind this line of printers. FlashForge has some internal builds that they use for flashing new bots, but these are not kept particularly up-to-date. Nor does FlashForge release the source files, so it's quite opaque where exactly the stock firmware differs from mainstream Sailfish. In the long run, you should install mainline Sailfish. But it's ok to stick with the factory firmware until you get used to the printer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To summarize: Because there is not an existing Sailfish build, you're going to need to do some investigating and some experimenting to figure out which build will work. Don't try that until you're familiar with the printer. Post on the FlashForge Google Group when you're ready for help." />

I guess you can cross that bridge if/when you add a HBP (heated build platform).  However, it can make a difference as to which firmware build you load as some builds of Sailfish will intentionally serialize heating so as to not put too high of a load on the power supply (PSU).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Armed with the above info, you can then decide if you want a 1280 or 2560 build of Sailfish.

Or you can contact the Sailfish team directly: speaking with very certain knowledge, I can assure you that they'd be happy to do a targetted build for your machine.

That's usually best, when possible. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you need to drill, you'll definitely want to print an undersized hole and then ream it out with the drill. This both provides alignment for the drill and adds extra plastic around the region you'll be weakening.

This is an easy way to strengthen the area with more plastic without making the entire part solid. (Using a slicer that allows localized print settings will also work.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The hole should be aligned more or less vertical or &quot;across the grain&quot; (+/-45 degrees aligned with the Z axis) to ensure there are nice, strong hoops of plastic around the hole to keep it from splitting. Drilling into a printed part (particularly PLA) from the side / parallel to the XY plane is highly likely to split it. It may even be ok at first but crack later under load or due to creep. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regular wood drill bits work ok, but you need to go slow and take nibbles, leaving the plastic time to cool so it doesn't melt and stick to the bit. (Coolant is an option.) Use a pilot hole, piloted bit, or step drill to remove less plastic per pass. A really sharp bit will perform dramatically better than a dull bit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put something hard and drillable like wood behind the plastic part to help avoid breakage and bit-jamming when you break through the opposite side.

There's some source that delivers a certain **voltage**.&#xD;&#xA; 2. You have a device that operates at a certain voltage. **The device voltage and supply voltage should always match.** No, don't put that 120V US device in a 230V outlet in Europe.&#xD;&#xA; 3. The device does something. By doing something it draws **current**. Most devices also draw some current when not doing anything.&#xD;&#xA; 4. How much power your device draws is the product of these two values:`voltage x current = power` &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So far, so good. In your case:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; US AC outlet.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    the **voltage is 120V**.&#xD;&#xA; 2. On [this other question of yours][1] you linked to [this power&#xD;&#xA;    supply on amazon][2]. Besides being available gift-wrapped, it&#xD;&#xA;    states the following feature:&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; You can choose the input voltage (110V/240V) by switch.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    110V ≈ 120V, which means the **device voltage matches your supply&#xD;&#xA;    voltage**.&#xD;&#xA; 3. The supply can deliver 30A at 12V on the DC side which means 360W.&#xD;&#xA;    If it could transform the electricity ideally, without any&#xD;&#xA;    inefficiency, that would be **3A** at 120V on the AC side. But your&#xD;&#xA;    supply is unlikely ideal. [Wikipedia suggests 60-95% efficiency][3].&#xD;&#xA;    Let's be super pessimistic and assume 50%. That means half the power&#xD;&#xA;    that goes into the switch power supply is turned into heat. In order&#xD;&#xA;    to still get the 360W out, you have to insert 720W. That means&#xD;&#xA;    **your device draws 6A** on the AC side.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What does this all mean for your wire?&#xD;&#xA;What wire size do you need for this supply?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Coincidentally, the above link to the amazon website showing your power supply also suggests the following PC ATX power supplies to me:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Sentey Power Supply 725 Watt][4]&#xD;&#xA; - [Sentey Power Supply 1000 Watt][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's get this straight: You can buy a power supply for a PC and plug it into your outlet without even thinking about what a wire size is. You'd just plug and play. **That PC power supply will potentially draw more current** than **the power supply of your 3D printer**. A standard wire would be able to supply either one of the PC ATX power supplies linked above and would not have a problem delivering a lower current to the power supply of your 3D printer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The switching supply doesn't have a plug like a PC ATX supply, but that on its own doesn't make it any less secure (if wired up properly). It's just less common for household appliances.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Ultimately, I'd like to avoid a fire, or damage to the house wiring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's a good and valid concern. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PC Power supplies deliver 12V and supply more than enough current (like the examples above). They are probably in use in your house already and did neither set it on fire nor damage the house wiring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A switching mode power supply is just as secure and if bought from a known brand unlikely to do you any harm either if used properly and within its specifications.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ultimately**, this is not a question of secure electricity but a trade-off between secure electricity and the price to pay for it. The standard wire and it's specifications have little to do with this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I also use a cheap switching power supply made in china for my printer.

The LCD screen provides two lines of block characters (as it normally does when initializing), but just hangs up there. I tried connecting the machine to my PC to try and restore the board to factory settings and install the latest firmware.

You can accomplish that just about any way you like, so long as you pair up the wires correctly from one motor to the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm assuming both &quot;Z&quot; motors are the same type and have the same color-coding for their wires. If not, you'll need to figure out the correspondences first (you may want to post another question if you need a hand with that, since it's pretty specific and generally useful).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many control boards have &quot;headers&quot; sticking up, with 4 bare pins for each motor. Connectors that plug right onto those are readily available, such as at https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10364.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some ways you can wire the motors in parallel:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some control boards, like my RAMPS 1.4, provide 2 sets of header pins next to the Z stepper driver board. In that case, just put a connector on each motor (if they're not there already), and plug them in next to each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If there's just one set of header pins (or one Z-motor socket of some other kind) on your controller, make a &quot;Y-cord&quot; by soldering the wires from one connector (that plugs to the controller) to *2* 4 pin connectors, one to mate with each motor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Or you can skip the 2 extra connectors entirely, and just solder the motor wires to the wires from the connector: 2 reds to red, 2 blacks to black, or whatever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If your controller just has empty holes, either solder in header pins and do as above, or wire directly into the holes, splicing the 2 sets of motor wires if there's only one set of holes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Motor and connector wires are wildly inconsistent, so make sure you get them sorted out right if they aren't already. The first thing is to check continuity: find 2 pairs of wires, which are the ends of two separate coils. If your motors have more than 4 wires it's trickier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With RAMPS (see handy diagram at http://makerdev.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ramps_fanboard_annotations.jpg), the 4 pins are commonly labelled (starting from the one nearest the power-supply end of the RAMPS board):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    2B 2A 1A 1B&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I find this totally confusing, because it could be either &quot;coil 2, ends A and B&quot; or &quot;coil A, ends 1 and 2&quot;. I figured it out once, but don't recall (will edit in the answer after I go look).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The *really good thing* about this order, is that if a motor is running backwards, all you have to do is power off and then turn the plug around. That's one reason I think it's important to keep connectors in there, rather than soldering directly." />

ABS and HIPS incorporate polybutadiene into a graft polymer structure for a very good reason: the butadiene sections in the long molecular chains kind of &quot;stick together&quot; as a distinct solid phase to produce what amounts to micro-bubbles of rubber inside a matrix of hard styrene or acrylonitrile-styrene plastic. This compound microstructure is what gives HIPS and ABS favorable impact toughness and some minor flexibility.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The flexibility is important -- the stiffer a filament is, the more it will tend to warp while printing. Based on chemistry alone, I would expect styrene to be somewhat more prone to warping than ABS. And it would certainly be more brittle. So there doesn't seem to be much reason to use it as filament.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interesting sidenote: PLA/PHA has very favorable mechanical properties because the PHA forms a very similar flexible microstructure inside the hard PLA matrix. PLA/PHA is good stuff because it mimics ABS and HIPS!" />

Determine what properties you need the filament to have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a very wide variety of filaments because they all have somewhat different properties.  You need to determine what properties you need your final print to possess.  For instance, ABS can be smoothed used acetone and PLA is biodegradable. More exotic filaments could be conductive or be extremely flexible. Do not neglect to consider safety of the plastic in your application. A full list of properties is too broad for an appropriate answer from this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Determine what you printer is designed to handle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most printers can handle PLA and ABS with little issue but higher temperatures are required to use some materials such as nylon and polycarbonate.  Determine beforehand what your printer is designed to handle.  This includes determining whether you have and appropriate heated bed or other accessories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Determine what you can afford.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Printing not only requires the cost of the weight of filament in the final print but all of the support structures and misprints you produce. Not only should you look for inexpensive filaments, but you should look for ones that are good enough quality you don't waste time and money fighting problems with the raw material.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, this will vary case by case.  I would recommend that you start with PLA or ABS as they are common and relatively easy to work with but that you do your own research into what each individual filament type has to offer..  " />

It was a good learning experience, but very frustrating at times. Overall, I think I'm glad I did it that way, but a kit would have gotten me printing much faster and a bit cheaper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are my main impressions from the experience...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* You should already be familiar with most of the basic skills involved: soldering, wood- and/or metal-working, electronics, etc. And don't forget software -- I wrote a lot of Arduino code for various things along the way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* You'll need to be diligent about searching for answers online, because there's no manual to go to. This group should make it a lot easier now than it was last year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some problems will have great answers online; some won't, or the answers will be hard to piece together. I found that stepper motors have a &quot;lore&quot; all their own, with several subtleties I didn't expect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* You'll have to decide *how* &quot;from scratch&quot; you want to go -- I bought completed Arduino Mega and RAMPs boards, but you could buy a kit or components for those instead, or even design your own electronics altogether.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* You'll make mistakes and spend money to recover. For example, my Y-axis motor couldn't move the build platform nearly fast enough (too much inertia), so I had to re-work that axis entirely, using a much more expensive lead screw, plus bearings, blocks, couplers,....&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If you think you might want to sell the printer later, I imagine it would be easier if it's a known design.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, it's a blast except when you get stuck; and the satisfaction when your first successful print comes out is pretty great.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oh, one other hint: especially for hardware, buy in bulk. You can probably get 100 of a certain bolt online for the price of 10 at your local hardware store. Give or sell the leftovers to help others get started.&#xD;&#xA;" />

That is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. If you get a kit, you can spend more time building.&#xD;&#xA; 2. If you collect all the parts yourself, you will have to spend time planning, ordering parts (possibly multiple times) in addition to actually building the printer. A possible lack of manuals could also increase the building difficulty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't already own a 3D printer, I would recommend getting a kit, simply because struggling with trivial things like parts not fitting together can take away the fun for many people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  " />

The first time, MakerBot graciously replaced it. However, they replaced with the same model board with no apparent fix for the commonly faulty voltage regulator. I can't afford the now $500 replacement board, so my option is to replace the faulty component and hope no further damage was taken on the board.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As MakerBot Industries did not need me to send in my old board, I've [followed these steps][1] to try and replace the voltage regulator on the old board.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've offset the voltage regulator towards the power jack, jumped the remaining pin on the voltage regulator to the remaining lead on the board (where the old voltage regulator was), but I'm confused what/where the green wire does/goes (mine is blue on my machine). The image looks like he just soldered it onto the heat sink pad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tried to test it by plugging in the power and the RGB LED strip. The stepper motor driver LEDs turned on, but the LED strip and none of the other on-board LEDs turned on. I'm not very seasoned when it comes to electronics, so can anyone explain what the actual pinout should be or suggest other ways to resolve this issue?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Update: Old Board Replacement ##&#xD;&#xA;So far I've replaced the regulator on my old board with some success. Before the replacement, the board wouldn't turn on (on-board LEDs wouldn't turn on). Now, all of the proper status LEDs turn on, but the board seems to be stuck in a boot sequence. The LCD screen provides two lines of block characters (as it normally does when initializing), but just hangs up there. I tried connecting the machine to my PC to try and restore the board to factory settings and install the latest firmware. However, the PC couldn't find the machine and I began to smell a bit of burning. I'm not sure if this is a result of permanent damage from the original regulator failing, or improper installation of the new regulator.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm going to dig around a bit more before attempting this fix on my main board. I'll edit this post as I continue the project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Update: New Board Replacement&#xD;&#xA;So, I've now attempted the fix on the newest board (the reason for this question). The results of this board are the same as the old one. I actually get power on the main board, but the LCD screen just shows two solid lines.

Text="In the diagram, they do show the wires connecting together, which is right. You can accomplish that just about any way you like, so long as you pair up the wires correctly from one motor to the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm assuming both &quot;Z&quot; motors are the same type and have the same color-coding for their wires. If not, you'll need to figure out the correspondences first (you may want to post another question if you need a hand with that, since it's pretty specific and generally useful).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many control boards have &quot;headers&quot; sticking up, with 4 bare pins for each motor. Connectors that plug right onto those are readily available, such as at https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10364.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some ways you can wire the motors in parallel:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some control boards, like my RAMPS 1.4, provide 2 sets of header pins next to the Z stepper driver board. In that case, just put a connector on each motor (if they're not there already), and plug them in next to each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If there's just one set of header pins (or one Z-motor socket of some other kind) on your controller, make a &quot;Y-cord&quot; by soldering the wires from one connector (that plugs to the controller) to *2* 4 pin connectors, one to mate with each motor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Or you can skip the 2 extra connectors entirely, and just solder the motor wires to the wires from the connector: 2 reds to red, 2 blacks to black, or whatever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If your controller just has empty holes, either solder in header pins and do as above (preferred, imho), or wire directly into the holes, splicing the 2 sets of motor wires if there's only one set of holes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Motor and connector wires are wildly inconsistent, so make sure you get them sorted out right if they aren't already. The first thing is to check continuity: find 2 pairs of wires, which are the ends of two separate coils. If your motors have more than 4 wires it's trickier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With RAMPS (see handy diagram at http://makerdev.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ramps_fanboard_annotations.jpg), the 4 pins are commonly labelled (starting from the one nearest the power-supply end of the RAMPS board):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    2B 2A 1A 1B&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It means coil 1 and coil 2, each of which has ends A and B. I find this unclear because it could just as well have been numbers for the coils, and letters for the ends (if you wire it that way it won't work). So be sure you have continuity (maybe 15 ohms or so) between the wires you connect to 2B and 2A, and between the wires you connect to 1A and 1B.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The *really good thing* about this pin order is that if a motor is running backwards all you have to do is power off and then turn the plug around. That's one reason I think it's important to keep connectors in there, rather than soldering directly." />

There's a lot of how-to's. A quick Google search yields [this][1] link to a similar question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key thing to note is that in all technicalities, any material you run through the nozzle is going to cause *some* sort of wear on your nozzle. **How quickly** depends on the material or composition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer to the question linked above relates it spot on to sandpaper. If you have sandpaper made out of metal (ie stainless pla), it will scratch your skin fairly easily. If you have sandpaper made out of tree bark (ie laywood pla), it probably won't scratch your skin as bad, but it'll still scratch. And just for poops and giggles, lets say you have sandpaper made out of pla; it'll take a while, but you could eventually make your skin raw if you rub the plastic against your arm long enough.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is typically recommended to use one nozzle for each material type as to avoid cross-contamination of materials in your printing.

But when it comes to vanilla ABS or PLA, it's almost the same content.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Personal experience: no. If you get the same pellets, store it in the same place and run your extruder in the same place, it should behave the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) I don't think there is some filament mixture you won't be able to find anywhere, but you might be able to make it yourself cheaper. Example: mixing strontium aluminate powder for glow in the dark filament (come in many colors, not just green).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd recommend this design: http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/&#xD;&#xA;It produces filament pretty fast (one full 1kg spoon in 3-4 hours). Just make sure you have enough experience to not electrocute yourself while assembling this as the heaters use mains power.&#xD;&#xA;I personally think the commercial &quot;hobby&quot; extruders are not worth the money.

However, you won't be able to drill holes (tempered glass *will* break of you drill a hole). Borosilicate glass has the advantage of being *extremely* heat-resistant, so it won't break from thermal expansion. If you go this route, you should pick up a few binder clips also to attach the sheet to the heated bed.&#xA;&#xA;Option #2- You might be able to get picture frame glass from a hardware store. It's super cheap (mine was $3 or something from lowes) and they'll often cut it to exact size. You might be able to drill this, but you have to be extremely careful. Sometimes, the hardware store can drill holes in the sheet for you if needed. If you don't want to drill, a few binder clips will work just as well.&#xA;&#xA;Just a note for if you are using binder clips: you might need to (depending on how your hbp is set up) get a piece of glass that is slightly smaller to allow for any bed leveling screws to have room. If you're going with the picture frame glass, you should make sure that the glass will be entirely within the heated part so that there isn't any heat gradient (that's how glass cracks/shatters).

Is such a printer available or in development ?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Practically speaking, no.  Metal printing requires significantly higher temperatures than plastic, and the two processes are so incompatible that there is currently no good solutions that would allow one printer to print both in the same print. Whether extruding filament, laser sintering, or curing resins, the materials involved have to be fairly similar in processing environment to print adjacent to each other without issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are many printers that are intended to print multiple materials by changing the print head.  You might, for instance, use a ceramic paste extruder, then change the head for the next print using plastic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There have been efforts in the past, and some efforts are ongoing, to resolve this.  For instance wood's metal, a low temperature alloy, can be poured at temperatures compatible with plastics, so it's possible to create a printer that prints plastic, leaving troughs or voids in the plastic, then the same printer during this print would pour molten woods metal into these areas, which then solidifies into an internal metal structure.  These are intended for circuitry and electrical use, however significant problems still exist because the thermal expansion differences in these materials lead to stress and result in poor reliability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So while some of these processes are being developed, this is still just in the experimental stage and there are significant problems to overcome before printers can print widely different materials in a single printing session.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course you can find plastics with such a wide range of characteristics that they can be seen as printing different materials.  Plastics imbued with wood fibers, printing next to conductive plastics with graphite, printing next to flexible plastics, etc, etc are now possible, and depending on your requirements they may meet your needs." />

If your bed isn't parallel to your X and Y axis movement, then you have to work very hard to make sure the heads are parallel to the bed, and with some mechanisms this isn't possible without making the mechanism itself parallel to the bed, so just mounting the new head at the same height as the other head might not be sufficient if your printer isn't perfectly calibrated already.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have not yet seen a printer or slicer that manages heads of different heights, but I suppose it's possible to manage the problem with additional intelligence.  For instance, if the printer can move the heads up and down independently, it might move one down for printing, and the other up and out of the way when it's not printing, and then the opposite when it switches.

Cracks and chips in the glass create an uneven surface for your prints, and can become a safety hazard; additionally, while borosilicate glass is very resistant to thermal shock, it can continue to crack or shatter when subjected to rapid/uneven temperature variations after damage. Borosilicate glass tends to break in large pieces rather than shattering (snap instead of splintering), but it's still a safety hazard. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It sounds like you have the Kickstarter version of the Robo3D R1; the current glass bed on the Robo3D uses magnets to hold the bed in place, so you'd probably need to replace your Y axis rails along with the bed. I would contact Robo3D support to see what options you have available for upgrading the bed and rails through them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aside from Robo3D, you have a few options:&#xD;&#xA; - If you plan to continue using the bed, Kapton tape is an effective surface application for general printing. It's very thin, but provides an effective surface for ABS &amp; PLA adherence, works with heated beds, and is compatible with secondary adherence items (blue masking tape, PVA glue, ABS slurry, etc). Kapton tape can be damaged after several prints, so plan on having several sheets on hand.&#xD;&#xA; - You can replace your current borosilicate glass with a new sheet of borosilicate glass from a secondary source&#xD;&#xA; - Aluminum plates are an effective replacement&#xD;&#xA; - Lexan sheets also make an effective replacement, but I wouldn't recommend applying heat to them." />

I think the quicker way is stopping the motors (in Repetier Host it's the &quot;Stop Motor&quot; button) and moving the gantry by hand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Second one is just more advanced version of the above.

Well, since there is a lot of vibration during print those tend to get out of place and that might explain why you end up readjusting it over and over again. What I have found to solve this is to use a single drop of loctite (cyanocrylate glue) in the middle of the nut/screw. A single drop will secure it in place but also not make it impossible to unscrew in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, if you can't get the bed leveled no matter what, it might be uneven. That's usually caused by warping. Both PCB beds and alumnum beds can get warped. With the former just sandwitch a glass bed on top of it and it should be fine. Warped aluminum is pretty hard to flatten. In this extreme situation you might need to get a new aluminum sheet cut and dripped, preferrably a mm thicker one which is less likely to warp under the same conditions." />

Your belt(s) could be loose. Simply loosen your Y-Axis motor and pull the motor until the belt is slightly more than taught (it will relax into a taught position). Then, tighten the motor securely in its place.&#xA; 2. One of your axis endstops could be triggered mid-print. If you have a larger print, you run the risk of hitting an endstop, which could cause the machine to lose its coordinate system.&#xA; 3. I found on my machine, if you run your program via USB (on MakerWare specifically, possibly others) there might be some sort of lag in the serial connection that could cause the entire program or coordinate system to shift. I repeated this issue multiple time using a USB connection and fixed it (repeatedly) by either running off of an SD card, using a different slicer (in my case the Cura plugin for OctoPi), or trying an earlier version of your software (this was my long term solution).&#xA;&#xA;The latter worked best for me. I tried running MakerBot Desktop on my Dual Replicator 1, but ran into the same exact issue as you. In fact, I encountered this issue around firmware 5.0 on the Replicator as well (7.? is the latest). Finally I switched back to using MakerWare 2.4.? and everything worked fine." />

Lines prefixed with `;` are comments, and does not affect the printing in any way. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, we want to manually tell the printer to do the auto leveling *before* heating up the nozzle by editing the g-code in `start.gcode`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###G-Code generated with the default start.gcode:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you try to slice some model with the default code found in `start.gcode`, you will get something like the following (depending on your printer):&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    ; CURA AUTOMATICALLY INSERTS THESE TEMPERATURE CODES&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    M190 S70.000000 ; Set bed temperature to 70 degrees&#xD;&#xA;    M109 S210.000000 ; Set nozzle temperature to 210 degrees&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ; THESE ARE THE CODES FROM START.GCODE (for a ROBO 3D R1) &#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    G28          ;move printer to endstops (the home position)&#xD;&#xA;    G92 E0       ;zero the extruded filament length&#xD;&#xA;    M565 Z-1     ;set z-probe offset&#xD;&#xA;    G1 Z5 F5000  ;move the printer 5mm above the bed&#xD;&#xA;    G29          ;run auto-leveling&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    ; THE ACTUAL MODEL BEGINS HERE&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ;Layer count: 168&#xD;&#xA;    ;LAYER:0&#xD;&#xA;    .&#xD;&#xA;    .&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Analyzing the g-code output&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the top of this code snippet, we can see that Cura automatically inserts g-code for heating up the bed and nozzle to their respective temperatures with the [M190][1] and [M109][2] g-codes. This means the printer always will heat up the nozzle before reading the `start.gcode`s that we set. However, if we manually override [M109][2] code in `start.gcode`, the [M109][2] at the top will automagically disappear from the generated g-code output! (Thanks, @TomvanderZanden!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We could therefore use the auto-leveling command [G29][3] before manually setting the nozzle temperature with [M109][2]; specifically, we want to add `M109 S{print_temperature}`, which reads the `Basic -&gt; Print Temperature`-setting in Cura, and replace `{print_temperature}` with it automatically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Manipulating start.gcode:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to postpone heating the hotend till after probing, `start.gcode` could be something like: &#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    G28          ;move printer to endstops (the home position)&#xD;&#xA;    G92 E0       ;zero the extruded filament length&#xD;&#xA;    M565 Z-1     ;set z-probe offset     &lt;-----   ( YOU HAVE TO ADJUST THIS, READ BELOW)&#xD;&#xA;    G1 Z5 F5000  ;move the printer 5mm above the bed&#xD;&#xA;    G29          ;run auto-leveling&#xD;&#xA;    M109 S{print_temperature}    ;set nozzle temperature, and wait for it heat up&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And that's about it! You can then use these codes in your `start.gcode`. However, you probably will have to recalibrate your z-prove offset. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Adjust z-probe offset:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Normally, auto-leveling is done with the nozzle heated for a reason: when the nozzle is warm, it expands slightly, moving closer to the bed. You might therefore have to adjust your Z-probe offset with the [M565][4] command (as demonstrated in the snippet) to account for the increase in nozzle length when warm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Remember:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that when editing g-code in this manner, you will take full control of how the printer operates. You could therefore very well do something unintended, so keep the power switch close! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M190:_Wait_for_bed_temperature_to_reach_target_temp&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M109:_Set_Extruder_Temperature_and_Wait&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#G29:_Detailed_Z-Probe&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M565:_Set_Z_probe_offset" />

You use a dial indicator/ micrometer attached to your extruder and make sure the number on the dial is as close as possible on all edges.&#xD;&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6eKDUzdfA&#xD;&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K19BaqhYD0c&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are also digital versions of this tool.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might need to print or make someother way a piece to be able to attach a micrometer to the extruder (there might be one for your 3d printer on Thingiverse already).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, remember I mentioned that you adjust the height of the edges of the print bed with a screw/nut? Well, since there is a lot of vibration during print those tend to get out of place and that might explain why you end up readjusting it over and over again. What I have found to solve this is to use a single drop of loctite (cyanocrylate glue) in the middle of the nut/screw. A single drop will secure it in place but also not make it impossible to unscrew in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) Setting up auto-bed leveling on your 3d printer if it's moddable enough.&#xD;&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGFLwj0pnA&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, if you can't get the bed leveled no matter what, it might be uneven. That's usually caused by warping. Both PCB beds and alumnum beds can get warped. With the former just sandwitch a glass bed on top of it and it should be fine. Warped aluminum is pretty hard to flatten. In this extreme situation you might need to get a new aluminum sheet cut and drilled, preferrably a mm thicker one which is less likely to warp under the same conditions. I think this happens when you either set the bed temp too high and/or the thickness of the aluminum bed is too small (bad or cheap 3d printer design)." />

That causes poor layer bonding and weaker prints. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The flow of molten plastic coming out of the nozzle must be drawn down by tension in order to end up smaller than the nozzle opening, and that drawing effect makes it difficult to get good contact with the previous layer. So you end up with a &quot;stack of logs&quot; structure kind of like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![0.4mm wide by 0.4mm tall strands through a 0.4mm nozzle][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;(This photo actually shows layer height = extrusion width = nozzle size, which is another no-no, but the end result is similar.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What you want instead is something very &quot;mashed together&quot; and strong like this:&#xD;&#xA;[![0.4mm wide by 0.4mm tall strands through a 0.4mm nozzle][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How finely the the strand can draw down -- versus smearing or breaking apart into blobs -- will depend greatly on the type of filament and the printing conditions. For example, nylon draws down extremely well because it experiences a large degree of strain crystallization, and actually gets stronger and stiffer as it's stretched. PLA tends to get more brittle when strained and may break into stringy blobs. ABS doesn't change terribly much because it's highly amorphous. Polymer type, blending agents, print speed, printing temperature, and cooling will control the drawing behavior of the filament. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another factor to consider is what the strand spacing is within the print. If you set the extrusion width equal to half the nozzle width, depending on the slicer, adjacent strands may be placed with pitch equal or slightly less than half the nozzle width. So after the first strand is printed (say an unimportant inner perimeter) **the *next* strand will be printed with the nozzle partially overlapping the previous strand.** This effectively creates a constriction to force the plastic out of a smaller opening to one side of the nozzle, which is not too different from printing with a smaller nozzle. Subsequent perimeter strands may then tend to &quot;heal up&quot; even if the first is low quality. This effect doesn't completely fix the problem, but it helps account for why under-width strands seem to work better than they ought to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, even if the strands turn out ok, it's arguable whether there is any benefit. If the goal of a smaller extrusion width is more precision and sharper corners, you may not actually accomplish that goal. When the filament is being drawn down by tension in the cooling polymer, it may tend to &quot;cut corners&quot; and get pulled into a rounded arc when the nozzle changes direction. That may defeat the point of using a thinner extrusion width in the first place. Generally I only recommend using under-width strands to capture thin-wall detail that is only a little bit too thin for the nozzle, not as a way to improve overall print quality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In comparison, having the extrusion width equal or wider than the nozzle ensures the plastic is firmly squished downward into intimate contact with the lower layer.

Glass, on the other hand, does not (at least not significantly).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As pointed out in the comments below, the heat expansion of aluminium could potentially be mitigated by increasing the thickness of the bed, as well as heating it evenly. Also, a common solution is to place a glass plate on top of an aluminium bed, at the cost of a slightly longer heat-up time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my experience, printing directly on heated glass can be very practical and give a nice surface finish for some PLA variants and other materials that support it. I don't know if printing directly on aluminium can give similar benefits." />

Bridging is when you are printing between two solid pieces (like a bridge). Overhangs occur when printing off of a single solid piece and coming back. Most slicing engines allow extra settings for speed, fan power, etc for these parameters, just refer to this terminology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A very common and simple solution in getting features to 3D print properly is to just slow down! If you're not a in a rush to get the part done, you bring down all of the feedrates in your slicing engine. MakerWare has mine at 90/150 mm/s for print and rapid. Typically I'll bring that down to about 50/90. My reasoning is the more time you give the plastic to cool, both while and after printing the layer, the more rigid that layer will be for the next one. When briding or overhanging, there will typically be a sagged area in the print. You can minimize this by providing the plastic more time to cool. Also keep in mind that printing on supports is still technically bridging (printing between two solid pieces).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing to keep in mind is adhesion from one layer to the next matter just as much between the current layer and the previous as the current strand to the one next to it. So, in some cases, increasing your shell could possibly make it easier for the infill/roof/floor strands." />

In my experience, a material like ABS will begin to flare out with variations in the print environment. When the material flares out, as the nozzle comes across the area again, the flared areas will be pushed aside. If you adjust your slicing settings to about 15 seconds ([refer to this calculator][1]), then the material will have time to cool slightly from its plastic state. You can cheat this slightly by adding another object somewhere further on the plate with the same height, since the time it takes to rapid to the area and print the layer might be enough time for cooling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would also recommend doing [some in depth maintenance][2] to eliminate in obvious problems (such as cleaning your nozzle, rods, belts, etc.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.abcgroup3.com/toolbox/mold_cooling_calc.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://blog.pinshape.com/3d-printer-maintenance/" />

Keeping up with gcode transmission/processing and motion planning for gcode with lots of very small segments, such as in organic models or smooth arcs&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When presented with a series of very small segments in a smooth arc or complex curve, the 8bit firmware will likely choke on the required command processing rate and introduce stuttering to the print. These incredibly brief pauses allow residual pressure in the extruder to push out some extra plastic, making a little zit on the print. So most slicers automatically decimate curves and output gcode with reduced resolution to lighten the load on the firmware. Problem solved, right?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But there's another issue -- the GRBL motion control algorithms underlying all the major open source 3D printer controllers were designed with lots of shortcuts and hacks to allow 8bit processors to execute fast enough. For example, the basic algorithm only looks at the speed or velocity change at the corner between two segments, and uses that to decide when to decelerate/accelerate along the direction of motion. It does not calculate or consider centripetal/radial acceleration whatsoever. This is a really effective hack when printing boxy, low-res models, but it fails miserably on smooth curves with lots of little segments. The firmware does not detect any appreciable velocity change at the corner of any two nearly-linear segments within the faceted curve, and thus does not slow down for the curve. So complex geometry is effectively printed at constant velocity, with no acceleration.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Printing complex perimeters unaccelerated means the commanded feedrate must be very low to get good quality. Most printers are limited to about 40mm/s or less on complex perimeters, despite being able to run perhaps 80-120mm/s on low-complexity infill before hitting other speed limits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Between the command processing rate limits and motion planner shortcomings required by low power processors, print speeds must be much lower in practice than is strictly required by the physics and printer hardware. This all comes from 8bit processors. The workarounds and best practices to deal with this problem are so deeply baked into the toolchains and ecosystem that very few people realize there is even a problem. But it's a real limit that can be overcome: a high-speed processor running a more rigorous motion planner could generate higher average print speeds with *better* print quality. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, the ARM-based firmwares are only slowly moving towards more advanced motion planners. This is a big development area right now that is actually driving an upcoming shift away from low-end ARMs like the Cortex M3 towards even faster processors. It's actually not all that hard to max out an 84 MHz Arduino Due by piling on a bunch of firmware features. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The use of 8bit processors also makes printers LOUDER. The biggest consumer of processor time in a typical 8bit printer is the stepper interrupt that fires the step pulses to make the motors move. It is quite typical for &gt;60% of all clock cycles on an Atmega AVR to go to firing step pulses. Because this occurs as an interrupt, other processing tasks that the printer must perform -- like acceleration calculations and heater control -- get squeezed into the brief spaces between stepper interrupt events. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Without careful firmware design, the step pulses will completely &quot;crowd out&quot; other functionality like LCD display updates and acceleration calculations. In order to allow higher motion rates without using all the processor resources, 8bit firmwares have a mode called &quot;step doubling&quot; that fires two (or four, or eight) step pulses per stepper interrupt so that half (or a quarter, or an eighth) as many stepper interrupts can be used to produce the same motion speed. This practice de-bottlenecks the processor, but it causes rougher and louder motor motion because the step pulses are fired in bursts rather than a constant frequency. In effect, the microstepping level of the motor is functionally dropped to a coarser mode when the stepper interrupt fires double or quad steps. So the motors get louder, less precise, and in extreme cases may have problems with resonance. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An interesting side effect is that if you switch a Marlin-based printer from 1/16 microstepping to 1/32 microstepping, and keep the same print speeds, the firmware will simply start step-doubling, dropping your effective microstepping level right back down to 1/16.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ARM-based firmwares also use step doubling, but the allowable step rates are typically ~8 times higher before double/quad stepping is used. That can mean higher speeds and/or smoother motion. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another issue with 8bit AVRs is the lack of hardware floating point and need to spend many clock cycles on high-precision calculations or handling very large numbers. Delta kinematics, auto-leveling functions, calculating moves with extremely high step counts for large printers, and other advanced functionality all take a **lot** of clock cycles on an 8bit processor. Poor firmware design or carelessly adding a feature that requires a few extra square roots and trig functions can completely bog down the processor. This kind of feature creep and code bloat has seriously impacted Marlin's performance over time as people ask more and more of the old AVR. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In comparison, a 32bit processor doesn't just have a faster clock and more clock cycles, it is also able to do much more complex math in fewer clock cycles, because it has dedicated hardware functionality that takes care of many of the steps an 8bit processor must do in software. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do 8bit processors work? Sure, they work surprisingly well for what they are and what we ask of them. But they unquestionably limit the performance and features of modern 3D printers. Even today's current generation of 32bit processors is already being maxed out by high speed printers and math-heavy features. The 8bit processor is already two generations behind what would qualify as a &quot;modern&quot; 3D printer controller. " />

Printing at a lower layer height can dramatically increase the smoothness of the finished part, while equally increasing the printing time - among several other things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A minimum layer height of 0.1 mm is fairly common for low-cost desktop FDM printers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Nozzle diameter:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just like the layer height defines the vertical resolution of a print, the nozzle diameter defines the sharpness of horizontal features of a print. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When printing with a large nozzle diameter, all sharp edges and corners of the model will have a slight roundness to them: the larger the nozzle diameter, the more rounded sharp corners will be, and vice versa. You might think of it as making a detailed drawing with a blunt pencil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A nozzle diameter of 0.4 mm can perhaps be considered the standard for desktop FDM printers today, and will allow you to print &quot;fairly accurate&quot; parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Will the daVinci work for you?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since I've never worked with the daVinci printer before, I cannot make a statement on it's user friendliness, or actual performance. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, if you intend to use it to print fragile, complex models such as insects, I believe a resin based printer might be more right for you, since they typically will allow for much higher reproduction of details than FDM printers. Printing solid/compact structures like coins and nuts, on the other hand, can typically be handled by a well calibrated FDM printer.  " />

If that's true, then I'm also assuming the next step is ensuring the slicing engine spits out the right format for the board (.s3g, .x3g, .gcode, etc.) and that the slicing engine knows the proper bounds for the machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Side question, if I used an another controller board, would I be able to still run MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop?

Makerbots use thermocouples. Most RepRap style 3d printers use thermistors. So you would need to replace the extruder temp sensors, or choose a new controller with thermocouple support. &#xD;&#xA; 2. Makerbots use 24v heaters and fans and PSUs. Most RepRap style 3d printers run on 12v (although this is slowly changing because 24v is better for performance and safety.) You can either pick a new controller that is known to be compatible with 24v, or replace all 24v-rated components with equivalent 12v-rated components. &#xD;&#xA; 3. The existing heatbed thermistor circuit is probably not the same kind of circuit that your new controller will expect. Older Makerbots use a small voltage divider circuit on the HBP PCB to convert the thermistor resistance to a voltage signal, whereas RepRap style controllers typically have this circuit on the mainboard and thus need only a simple thermistor hookup. You could add a new thermistor, or modify the existing circuit, or get an entirely new heatbed. &#xD;&#xA; 4. The existing endstops are full +5v,GND,Signal style mechanical switches with debounce capacitors and LED indicators. These *should* be compatible with *most* controller boards given proper firmware setting, but you may need to do some creative wiring if there isn't a suitable three-pin endstop port on your chosen board.&#xD;&#xA; 5. The LCD and 5-button panel will not work with other boards. You'll need to replace that or just run a remote host via USB.&#xD;&#xA; 6. Connectors may be different, of course. That's always an issue with any board swap. &#xD;&#xA; 7. You will need to export RepRap style gcode instead of .x3g files. Makerware/Desktop can export gcode but there may be some minor differences in Mcode assignments from what most RepRap style firmware will expect. I couldn't tell you offhand whether this will work, but to be safe, it would probably be best to use a more traditional RepRap slicer (Slic3r, Cura) or Simplify3D.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So that's a healthy to-do list. At a certain point you're practically building a new printer. **But there is a significantly easier approach** than installing a RepRap style controller: replace the dead Makerbot Mightyboard with a compatible community-designed Sailfish board like the Azteeg x3 by Panucatt or new CloneBoard Mini by Carl Raffle. Or, if you're ok with Chinese sourcing, a FlashForge Mightyboard will be a near 100% drop-fit replacement for your Makerbot Mightyboard. Any of these options will give you fresh new electronics with minimal hardware changes in the rest of the printer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Either way is fine and you'll end up with a working printer. Using another Sailfish board will certainly be easier, if you don't object to staying within the Sailfish/x3g toolchain and Makerbot/Clone parts ecosystem. Makerbot does have a very bad community reputation these days, but it's important to remember that the Replicator 1 Dual is a completely open-source machine from the &quot;pre-evil&quot; days, and compatible spare parts are widely available from literally dozens of vendors. The Rep1-derived Makerbots and Clones collectively comprise the most popular single &quot;flavor&quot; of 3d printer in the world (totaling as much as perhaps a quarter of all consumer/hobbyist 3d printers sold to date) and many/most of the spare parts for Replicator 2/2x's and clones will also fit in a genuine Rep1.

I have heard from a number of resellers that the problems are fixed. Unfortunately, both of those are somewhat biased sources. It's surprisingly hard to get good info on the subject -- very few credible people are talking about recent experiences with the product line. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Issue #1:** The main surviving user forum (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/makerbot-users) has had the torrent of people reporting 5th gen issues more or less dry up. There ARE still people posting issues, but at a fairly low level that is not far outside what you would expect for an average hobbyist printer. What we DON'T know is whether the flood of complaints has slowed because they're working better, or because very few people are actually buying them any more. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Issue #2:** The power-users and community leaders that typically evaluate and review 3d printers are all avoiding the 5th gen line like the plague. Makerbot burned up a lot of community good-will by going closed source with the Replicator 2, and lost more good-will through a series of misunderstandings over patent applications and the Thingiverse terms of service (Takerbot scandals), and put the nail in the coffin by **knowingly** releasing a non-functional 5th gen product line. Very few credible people are willing to give them a chance at this point, so there is a severe shortage of unbiased reviews.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Issue #3:** Makerbot has a proven history of buying off journalists and reviewers to get positive 5th gen press. Some verifiable examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Hundreds of fake 5-star Amazon reviews from paid review accounts. A relevant analysis: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1/ (Not verified, but related: a widely-believed rumor states that the German Amazon site actually wiped all of Makerbot's 5th Gen reviews because of blatant tampering: http://www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806/)&#xD;&#xA; - The CES awards initially given to the 5th Gen line were given before Makerbot had functional firmware. None of the 5th Gens at the CES launch were functional. All demo prints shown were made on Replicator 2s. How could a non-functional product win awards? Not hard to figure that one out. &#xD;&#xA; - Historical positive press in the 3DP journalism media (3ders, Make Magazine, etc) has been directly proportional to the volume of ad-buys from Makerbot or the parent company Stratasys. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I could keep going, but you get the idea. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it's hard to evaluate the reality of the situation. **But even IF the Smart Extruder issues are truly all fixed** (jams, leveling issues, thermocouple connection, filament encoder failures, etc), **there are still meaningful problems with the product line.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The print quality is not impressive. The motion mechanics, which have not been appreciably changed to my knowledge, are not great. The Smart Extruder is basically a giant pendulum wobbling off the side of a non-optimal gantry selection of an H-bot architecture. Makerbot has addressed the floppy construction via firmware tweaks to significantly slow down the machine to give marginally-acceptable print quality. According to most reports I have seen, a Replicator 5th Gen will print significantly slower than a Replicator 2, for example. Expect in the neighborhood of perhaps 30-40% longer print times than comparable printers.&#xD;&#xA; - The price tag is roughly double or even triple the current market price for the size and print quality output of the machine. There are so many great printers on the market now for significantly less money that it's kind of nuts to drop the cash on a Makerbot.&#xD;&#xA; - It is marketed as a PLA-only machine. That's fine if you're printing art and trinkets, but it's not a great option for mechanical parts. While you CAN print other materials, this is not technically supported. &#xD;&#xA; - The support plan structure has quite frankly become abusive. Makerbot used to have really helpful phone tech support, but the crushingly massive volume of 5th gen troubleshooting requests forced them into a paid tech support model. Around the same time, Makerbot shut down their user community forum and deleted links to external technical resources off their website. So unless you know the right places to go, support is scarce. For official tech support you must buy &quot;Makercare&quot; or pay for each help ticket. This is completely out of line with industry norms for a hobbyist/consumer 3d printer. They essentially took their biggest liability -- unreliable printers -- and tried to twist it into a profit center. I personally think this is a significant reason to avoid the company entirely.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is it possible to get good results from a Replicator 5th Gen? Sure. But it's a poor value for the cost, from a company that has spent the last few years systematically driving away its former loyal user base. I would recommend staying away until there's some significant change in the product line at minimum." />

The first time, MakerBot graciously replaced it. However, they replaced with the same model board with no apparent fix for the commonly faulty voltage regulator. I can't afford the now $500 replacement board, so my option is to replace the faulty component and hope no further damage was taken on the board.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As MakerBot Industries did not need me to send in my old board, I've [followed these steps][1] to try and replace the voltage regulator on the old board.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've offset the voltage regulator towards the power jack, jumped the remaining pin on the voltage regulator to the remaining lead on the board (where the old voltage regulator was), but I'm confused what/where the green wire does/goes (mine is blue on my machine). The image looks like he just soldered it onto the heat sink pad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tried to test it by plugging in the power and the RGB LED strip. The stepper motor driver LEDs turned on, but the LED strip and none of the other on-board LEDs turned on. I'm not very seasoned when it comes to electronics, so can anyone explain what the actual pinout should be or suggest other ways to resolve this issue?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Update: Old Board Replacement ##&#xD;&#xA;So far I've replaced the regulator on my old board with some success. Before the replacement, the board wouldn't turn on (on-board LEDs wouldn't turn on). Now, all of the proper status LEDs turn on, but the board seems to be stuck in a boot sequence. The LCD screen provides two lines of block characters (as it normally does when initializing), but just hangs up there. I tried connecting the machine to my PC to try and restore the board to factory settings and install the latest firmware. However, the PC couldn't find the machine and I began to smell a bit of burning. I'm not sure if this is a result of permanent damage from the original regulator failing, or improper installation of the new regulator.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm going to dig around a bit more before attempting this fix on my main board. I'll edit this post as I continue the project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Update: New Board Replacement&#xD;&#xA;So, I've now attempted the fix on the newest board (the reason for this question). The results of this board are the same as the old one. I actually get power on the main board, but the LCD screen just shows two solid lines.

This plunger used copper washers to help adjust the tension required. Many people ended up upgrading their assemblies to the spring loaded mechanism as the plunger would either put too much or too little tension against the drive gear. Too little and the filament will not be driven into the hotend. Too much and the filament will grind against the drive gear and the drive gear may begin to &quot;eat&quot; away at the filament (especially when the filament becomes hotter). Obviously, if the drive gear is no longer able to catch on the filament, the nozzle will get clogged.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, even with a spring mechanism, your tension can become too high. Most of these mechanisms allow you to adjust the tension by tightening/loosening the screw holding down the spring. The &quot;sweet spot&quot; for me is just past when the filament can be successfully driven into the hotend. You can test this if you have control over your extrusion motor by removing the extrusion motor from its mount, leaving the spring mechanism installed on the face of the motor. Then, turn your motor on and try feeding the filament through the mechanism. Starting with no tension on the spring, begin slowly increasing tension by tightening the screw on your mechanism until the drive gear is successfully able to guide the filament through. I might even complete another half turn on the screw to account for varying diameters and plasticity states of the filament as it becomes hot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully this helps and please keep us updated on anything else you find." />

So theoretically if you have Black filament, you'll want to extrude with a lower temperature than you would with a natural &quot;White&quot; filament. I would think that the necessary difference in temperature would be a few degrees (Celsius). However, there are many other factors, such as moisture and manufacturing techniques that can take precedence over color differences.&#xA;&#xA;My advice, figure out how to &quot;cheaply&quot; analyze your material and ensure you have an accurate temperature feedback loop. If can you do that, you'll be able to drastically change the quality of consumer 3D printing." />

Additional firmware parameters clutter up my (beginner's) brain even more (and I haven't had a too deep dive into that yet).&#xD;&#xA;In general I understand that the frequency we use to send the steps to the stepper is the main determining factor, also 'reduced' by microstepping, if applied. We cannot keep the current up as much as needed due to timing/inductive/electronic properties of the motors, so we lose torque or finally steps. A higher voltage helps to bring the current up faster, so the steepness of the current increase can also limit the maximum applicable frequency. The frequency itself is given from the controller board to the motor driver, hence is set in firmware.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, apart from what makes sense to utilize in a 3D printer setup, what are the determining factors of the stepper speeds that can be realized and how to they transform into real life values for our printers? Also I'd be interested in how the determining factors influence the reliability and print quality regardless of the mechanical difficulties that arise with print-speed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;/edit:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;I found these to exist on electroncs SE:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/71270/maximum-speed-of-stepper-motor &lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/129064/slow-down-stepper-motors-speed-using-stepper-driver-drv-8825&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I think the question here is relevant and specific enough for 3D printing to exist here alongside." />

There is a significant range, particularly when 32bit firmwares and RTOS-based platforms like MachineKit are compared to 8bit firmwares running on Atmega AVRs. Some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Marlin on a 16 MHz 8bit Atmega can only run the stepper interrupt at 10,000 hz without bogging down the processor and blocking other critical algorithms (like motion planning). It can fire step rates up to 40,000 hz by pulsing the step line two or four times per interrupt, which effectively drops the microstep level in software and runs the motors rougher/louder. &#xD;&#xA; - Repetier on the same Atmega can run the stepper interrupt at 12,000 hz, because it is optimized more for execution speed than Marlin.&#xD;&#xA; - Repetier on an 84 MHz 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 can run the stepper interrupt at 80,000 Hz.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*These limits typically only affect actual stepper speed when relatively fine microstepping is used.* Consider an example based on a very typical Marlin printer configuration. Microstepping of at least 1/4 is strongly recommended to avoid resonance issues, so let's start with 1/16 stepping. This allows quad-stepping to effectively output 1/4-steps. Starting with finer microstepping will drop our top speed, and coarser microstepping will be louder and may encounter resonance, so this is a good starting point. Then asssume a typical 32mm-per-rev pulley on a 1.8 degree (200 steps/rev) stepper motor. This system has a resolution of 200*16/32= 100 steps/mm. At 40,000 Hz total stepping rate (quad-stepping at 10,000 Hz) we can theoretically travel at 400 mm/s before hitting Marlin's hard cap. That's probably going to be a higher RPM than we want to run the motor anyway, so it's not a very impactful limit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In comparison, if we started at 1/128 stepping (such as with the THB6128 driver chip) our top speed with 8bit Marlin would be 50 mm/s. That's quite slow. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Firmware motion planners** can further limits motor speed by ramping up and down to traverse turns and corners. If the model geometry has lots of sharp turns, the target speeds commanded by the gcode are likely to never actually be reached. Only long, straight line paths will have enough ramping time to hit the speed target. You can see this yourself by printing a very small model at a variety of feedrates and timing the actual print duration: at a certain point, increases in the commanded speed will make no difference on actual print times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another constraint some firmwares enforce is requiring the ability to safely decelerate to a stop within the length of all the motion commands in the planner queue. This allows the printer to gracefully handle a sudden loss of input, such as as if the host computer stops transmitting USB commands, or if the SD card experiences a series of read errors. If the printer just abruptly stops from full speed when it runs out of commands, it is likely to lose position and ruin the print. Whereas if it can decelerate to a safe stopping speed, it may be able to resume after the command stream resumes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of actual motor behavior, the **inductance and back-EMF** introduce significant limits because they decrease motor torque at higher RPMs. This produces a torque/RPM curve that drops off at higher speeds:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note in the picture that there is a flat &quot;constant current&quot; region on the left side at low speeds. This is the range where the chopping driver is limiting coil current. On the right side of the curve, current is not able to reach the target before it must be switched back off for the next step. That reduces field strength and thus torque.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two separate effects to consider here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Motor coils are inductors, which means there is a first-order lag between applied voltage and coil current. A standard bipolar stepper motor with a microstepping driver must raise the coil current from zero to max or from max to zero every full step (eg every sixteen 1/16th microsteps). At high step rates, there is not enough time to fully charge the coil to its max current before the next step requires dropping the current back down. Without developing full coil current on each step, torque is lost. &#xD;&#xA; - Every motor is also a generator, and spinning the rotor generates back-EMF voltage within the motor coils. That voltage waveform gets overlaid on top of the drive voltage waveform with a phase shift dependent on the rotor position relative to the coil energization position. *In simple terms, this voltage attempts to brake the motor:* it always does whatever will slow the motor down. This means it opposes the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying forward torque, or assists the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying brake torque. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a practical discussion of speed limits, we can simplify the situation by assuming back-EMF voltage opposes the drive voltage applied to the coils. This means there is less effective voltage raising/lowering coil current, and it takes longer for the current to change, and less coil current is developed than would be the case without back-emf. This further depresses the torque/RPM curve of the motor. And when the back-EMF voltage is around the same magnitude as the drive voltage, significant motor instability can result because of complex feedback effects between rotor position and effective coil voltage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can play with these effects using different motor configurations and speeds for a few popular 3D printer stepper drivers using my stepper driver simulator: https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In closed-loop applications with position feedback and high-end drivers that can damp various instability modes, it may be ok to run the stepper all the way down the torque curve at very high RPMs. In more typical open-loop 3D printer applications, it's generally best to stick to the low-RPM part of the torque curve before inductance and back-EMF really take over the motor behavior. Losing too much torque can easily mean skipping steps and losing position, ruining the print. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another important effect for steppers is **mid-band resonance**. This is not a normal mechanical resonance, but actually an electromechanical resonance effect. It's quite complicated, but the short explanation is that a stepper has an intrinsic 90-degree phase shift between position and torque, and when speeds rise to a point where coil inductance introduces an additional 90-degree phase shift between coil current and applied voltage, the electromechanical system has a highly-unstable 180-degree phase lag and thus creates a negative feedback loop. This can rapidly drop motor torque until the motor loses synchronicity with the driver's applied voltage and stalls.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mid-band resonance only occurs when coil current is limited by inductance. It cannot occur in the constant-current drive range because there is not enough phase lag between applied voltage and coil current.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, measured torque curves available from manufacturers almost never show resonance zones, because the curves are produced by loading motors with friction-brakes that damp any kind of resonance effect from building. Whereas a 3D printer drivetrain load is almost entirely inertial (accelerating a mass) which is much more prone to resonance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;High-end drivers can automatically detect and damp mid-band resonance, but typical low-cost 3D printer drivers do not have this capability. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is generally prudent to avoid entering an RPM range where mid-band resonance may occur. This is easily accomplished by sticking to the left side of the torque curve, in the constant-current operating region. This ensures high torque and good stability. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a concrete example, consider the popular Kysan 1124090 stepper with a 24v power supply. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To maintain high torque and avoid mid-band resonance, we would want to keep the RPM to about 400 or less. For the same 32mm-per-rev pulley mentioned above, that would limit speeds to around 200-240 mm/s. Higher speeds are possible, but may encounter reliability issues. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This speed, of course, assumes a 24v PSU is used, to match the measured torque curve: a 12v PSU would have a significantly lower top speed before inductance starts to limit coil current, around half as fast. Higher supply voltage *greatly* increases the top effective speed for the motor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, you can easily simulate this effect if you know the back-EMF voltage per RPM for your motor. (Using https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim) The back-EMF parameter is critical at higher speeds, but unfortunately, it is not typically provided in manufacturer datasheets. But it is very easy to measure by spinning the motor at a known RPM (such as with a drill press) and measuring the open-circuit RMS AC voltage across one of the coils. This simulator output chart shows how inductance and back-EMF are keeping coil current from reaching the target:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For practical drivetrain design, a motor/driver simulator is really the best tool in the toolbox for finding the point where performance will start to degrade due to inability to hit current targets. That and the firmware step generation limits are likely to be the two main restrictions on motor speed for most printers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg" />

And when the back-EMF voltage is around the same magnitude as the drive voltage, significant motor instability can result because of complex feedback effects between rotor position and effective coil voltage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can play with these effects using different motor configurations and speeds for a few popular 3D printer stepper drivers using my stepper driver simulator: https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In closed-loop applications with position feedback and high-end drivers that can damp various instability modes, it may be ok to run the stepper all the way down the torque curve at very high RPMs. In more typical open-loop 3D printer applications, it's generally best to stick to the low-RPM part of the torque curve before inductance and back-EMF really take over the motor behavior. Losing too much torque can easily mean skipping steps and losing position, ruining the print. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another important effect for steppers is **mid-band resonance**. This is not a normal mechanical resonance, but actually an electromechanical resonance effect. It's quite complicated, but the short explanation is that a stepper has an intrinsic 90-degree phase shift between position and torque, and when speeds rise to a point where coil inductance introduces an additional 90-degree phase shift between coil current and applied voltage, the electromechanical system has a highly-unstable 180-degree phase lag and thus creates a negative feedback loop. This can rapidly drop motor torque until the motor loses synchronicity with the driver's applied voltage and stalls.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mid-band resonance only occurs when coil current is limited by inductance. It cannot occur in the constant-current drive range because there is not enough phase lag between applied voltage and coil current.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, measured torque curves available from manufacturers almost never show resonance zones, because the curves are produced by loading motors with friction-brakes that damp any kind of resonance effect from building. Whereas a 3D printer drivetrain load is almost entirely inertial (accelerating a mass) which is much more prone to resonance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;High-end drivers can automatically detect and damp mid-band resonance, but typical low-cost 3D printer drivers do not have this capability. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is generally prudent to avoid entering an RPM range where mid-band resonance may occur. This is easily accomplished by sticking to the left side of the torque curve, in the constant-current operating region. This ensures high torque and good stability. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a concrete example, consider the popular Kysan 1124090 stepper with a 24v power supply. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To maintain high torque and avoid mid-band resonance, we would want to keep the RPM to about 400 or less. For the same 32mm-per-rev pulley mentioned above, that would limit speeds to around 200-240 mm/s. Higher speeds are possible, but may encounter reliability issues. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This speed, of course, assumes a 24v PSU is used, to match the measured torque curve: a 12v PSU would have a significantly lower top speed before inductance starts to limit coil current, around half as fast. Higher supply voltage *greatly* increases the top effective speed for the motor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, you can easily simulate this effect if you know the back-EMF voltage per RPM for your motor. (Using https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim) The back-EMF parameter is critical at higher speeds, but unfortunately, it is not typically provided in manufacturer datasheets. But it is very easy to measure by spinning the motor at a known RPM (such as with a drill press) and measuring the open-circuit RMS AC voltage across one of the coils. This simulator output chart shows how inductance and back-EMF are keeping coil current from reaching the target:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For practical drivetrain design, a motor/driver simulator is really the best tool in the toolbox for finding the point where performance will start to degrade due to inability to hit current targets. It's simply too complex to apply simple equations or rules of thumb with any accuracy. These electrical effects and the firmware step generation limits are likely to be the two main restrictions on motor speed for most printers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, how fast you can melt plastic will tend to limit printing speeds significantly below the true motor speed limits, but that's a different discussion. For the moment, we can simply say that top motor speed tends to be unimportant for print moves in typical Cartesian printers. However, there are a few instances where they are likely to drive printer performance:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Linear Deltas, where carriages may need to run several times faster than the effector for certain move directions&#xD;&#xA; - Geared extruders with high reduction ratio (eg much over 5:1) for high retraction speeds&#xD;&#xA; - Short-pitch lead screws (or all-thread) that need high rotation speeds to achieve moderate linear speeds&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg" />

Use some basic trigonometry or the pythagorean theorem to tie extruder position to carriage height for each of the three towers (&quot;Inverse Kinematics&quot;) &#xD;&#xA;to find the target position for each small segment&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The inverse kinematics are surprisingly simple.

(How THAT is done is a different question.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The net effect is that the printer will move through a series of small &quot;linear&quot; carriage movements (linear meaning constant* speed with respect to time) that collectively approximate the necessary curved (quadratic position with respect to time) carriage motions required to produce a straight-line end-effector move.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*(*Constant speed before acceleration slowdowns are applied in order to obey dynamics constraints, anyway. Again, that's the subject of a different question.)*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Segmentation is very similar to the process of using a polygon to approximate a circle. If the facets are small enough, the polygon is a good approximation. Higher Segmentation rates produce less path-following error.  The primary conceptual difference between drawing circle arcs and Delta motion paths is that the so-called &quot;faceted arc&quot; with Delta Segmentation is constructed in height-vs-time coordinates instead of the X-vs-Y coordinates you'd use to draw a circle on a computer screen. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This system is used in large part because support for Delta style printers was originally bolted onto GRBL-based motion planners which were written exclusively for straight-line motion paths in Cartesian printers. It was a relatively minimal modification to the existing codebase compared to implementing full quadratic path interpolation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Techniques have evolved over the years. And alternate approaches are often used: for example, the dc42 fork of RepRapFirmware performs exact path-following without segmentation, by recalculating the proper time for the next step *after every step*. This is functionally equivalent to approximating a circle with a polygon facet count *so high that every pixel on the screen gets its own facet*. So it is exactly as accurate as the positioning resolution of the motors allows. The downside is that this segmentation-free technique is fairly processor-intensive, so it only works on relatively fast controllers, not the older 8bit Atmega AVR that powers most existing consumer/hobbyist printers today. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other techniques are possible. The academic parallel robotics control literature is a whole other world of mathematical techniques and complexity in order to produce generalized control algorithms that work for a wide range of robot mechanisms. The version we use in open-source 3d printers is quite simple and application-specific in comparison. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/MxCMc.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/geOQI.jpg" />

I'm not familiar with the inner workings of how it works, but the general advice is to be conscious of what you're working with. A heat-induced vapor treatment seems to yield the best surface finish, but can be tricky to track down proper exposure times. It seems that the time required to achieve a desirable surface finish depends on the size and openness of the features on the object. By openness, I mean how evenly the vapor is able attach itself to the surface of the object as compared to other features. Some this variability may be reduced by streamlining the process. Perhaps if you found a way to rotate either the part or the vapor container during the process. This could ensure contact is made in small corners/features. Other variables to consider may be:&#xA;&#xA; - If a gradual reduction of exposure is necessary (as is with most heat treatment operations)&#xA; - How much temperature effects time. Most pages I've read mention 100C as the temp to vaporize the chemical.&#xA; - Size of the &quot;vaporization chamber&quot; in accordance with how much of the chemical is available. I've used a gallon paint can lined with lightly dabbed paper towel with Acetone for part between 1&quot;^3 to about 4&quot;^3&#xA;&#xA;That's all I can think of, currently, that could potentially have the most impact on the process. Just as with 3D printing, there's not an easy way to definitively know how your parts will turn out. The sheer difference in the shape of your parts could throw out any &quot;proven process&quot; you come up with. Hopefully this gives you an idea of what things to look out for in starting out.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;*Here's information about safety, before OP added disclaimer*&#xA;&lt;s&gt;As with any chemical, **always** refer to the MSDS &lt;sup&gt;(Material Safety Data Sheet)&lt;/sup&gt;!

If you double the size, you've quadrupled the surface area and octupled the weight.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you take a desktop-sized 3d printer design, and just double the size, it will weigh 8 times as much. But all the bolts holding it together are only 4 times as strong. So weight-bearing bolts are effectively under twice the strain (per unit of cross-sectional area); the exact factor depends of lots of things (orientation, leverage, etc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you scale up by 10x, they'll potentially be under 10 times greater stress, and probably snap.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many, many parts will have similar issues: Drive belts that are twice as wide and twice as thick will still have 1/2 the (relative) strength -- and stiffness for the motors to overcome. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The stepper motors have to move 8 times the weight, *and* you'll want them to move far, far faster. But steppers lose torque when you spin them faster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My main printer is pretty much a MendelMax 2, but the Y axis is about 6 times bigger (X and Z are normal). On MM2 the whole build platform moves along Y -- on my printer it weighs far more than on a regular-size MM2 -- it's 6 times the mass just because of size, besides that it has to be much stiffer to avoid sagging over that distance. I went to a larger motor, but it could still barely move the axis. I eventually got it to move at pretty normal speed, but to print long objects it really should be 6 times faster or so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That would require an amazing motor -- and really big electronics to drive it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another challenge is the printing material -- 20mm diameter PLA fiber would be really impressive, but a little hard to find, and a spool would be hard to lift. The power needed to melt it fast enough would be impressive, too. Bridge and house printers I've seen in reports, use pumped concrete through about a 100mm wide nozzle (I have no idea what the nozzle is made of, to stand up to the abrasion).

If you want to do high-speed printing or use any of the fancier features, you should go with 32bit.***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The big issue with 8bit comes up when you want to do something that taxes the MCU. Delta kinematics already add a lot of extra math on top of all the normal printer functions like command parsing, motion planning, and heater control. For example, adding any of these to an 8bit Delta can cause issues:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Bed tilt compensation &quot;auto-leveling&quot;** -- the coordinate space rotation transform adds a lot of extra floating point calculations to every movement segment. That really taxes the 8bit Atmega since it does not have native floating point support. (Note that pre-print auto-calibration such as in the RichCattell Marlin fork is not the same as bed tilt compensation and does not add any run-time processor load.)&#xD;&#xA; - **Full graphics LCDs** -- refreshing the LCD screen for animations and status reports takes a surprising amount of horsepower. 8bit Marlin is widely known to suffer from stuttering and print quality issues when running a GLCD on a delta.&#xD;&#xA; - **Highly faceted (smooth) curves, particularly over USB** -- the high rate of gcode command processing sucks up a lot of clock cycles, particularly in firmwares that run USB comms as a top-priority interrupt. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What the Due (or other 32bit board option) does for you is de-bottleneck the MCU so you can push the printer harder or utilize features that add processor load. Here's why they're so much better:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - In simple clock speed terms, the SAM3X8E in the Due/Duet/Alligator/etc is about 5 times faster than the Atmega 2560, and the LPC1769 in the Smoothieboard/MKS-SBASE/etc is about 7 times faster. But they're actually MUCH higher performance than clock speed alone would suggest, because the 32bit architecture and native floating point support mean far fewer clock cycles are required for complex calculations. &#xD;&#xA; - They also have more RAM, meaning the the firmware can manage more features and look farther ahead when motion planning. &#xD;&#xA; - They also have more program space, meaning the firmware can, if desired, be compiled as a single full-featured build that covers all possible printers (as RepRapFirmware and Smoothieware do) and thus end-users don't have to edit and compile code in the Arduino IDE to configure the firmware. The Atmega line requires hundreds of conditional compile statements in the firmware to exclude unused features from the binary to get the memory footprint down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All that said, the switch from an 8bit Atmega AVR to a 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 is still just an upgrade from a late-1990s processor to an early-2000s processor. Neither is &quot;modern&quot; by any stretch. *(For example, the BeagleBone Black used by Redeem and MachineKit utterly blows away the Due in processing power and memory. But those options have steep learning curves at the moment.)* The Due can still be bogged down by printing very fast with lots of features enabled. It's a **big** upgrade on an Atmega, but I predict it's going to be replaced by much faster controllers within the next few years. Announcements of upcoming next-gen controller boards are already trickling out. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To summarize, the answer is yes, a Due-type board is a good buy if you want a high-performance printer. It will meet 99%+ of user's needs today. But it will be replaced in a few years, just like the Atmegas are being replaced now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for specific Due shields, I strongly recommend NOT going with RAMPS-FD. It was cloned for sale by Asian companies before the design was finished, so the original designer abandoned it before working out all the bugs. RAMPS-FDv1 has very nasty design flaws such as heaters turning on while flashing firmware. RAMPS-FDv2 is better, but can cause unreliable and oddball behavior due to unresolved issues in the circuits intended to make it compatible with both 3v3 boards like the Due and 5v boards like the Mega. (For example, the thermistor voltage reference circuit needs modifying to work right, and there appears to be timing issues in the 3v3-5v level shifters.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;RADDS is a good Due shield. It is a simpler, more reliable, more compact version of RAMPS-FD. It is very popular in Germany and has recently (late 2015) become available for sale in the US. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One possible downside to the Due is that Arduino just announced they are no longer manufacturing it. So all new Due boards from here on will be made by 3rd parties. That's not necessarily bad, it's open source and many other companies will surely continue making them, but there won't be any made by Arduino. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For single-board options using the Due's SAM3X8E processor, the Duet 0.8.5 is becoming quite popular.

Specifically, the filament path between the drive gear or hob and hot end must be extremely well-constrained. 1.75mm TPE filaments (thermoplastic elastomers) will buckle in an instant if given the chance. That means they will try to squeeze out of any little opening in the filament drive path rather than being forced through the nozzle. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Is there a gap &gt;1mm *anywhere* between your extruder drive gear and hot end? *Including the groove in the drive gear itself.* If so, either change extruders or print something to fill the gap. Many popular extruders already have Ninjaflex conversion parts uploaded on Thingiverse or Youmagine.&#xD;&#xA; - Are you using a 1.75mm bowden drive? You probably shouldn't bother with the softer TPEs like Ninaflex. Harder TPEs like Semiflex may be ok, but it's still difficult. 3mm bowden drives may perform ok. Direct drive extruders are highly recommend. &#xD;&#xA; - TPUs (thermoplastic urethanes) in particular can be sticky in the filament feed path between the spool and extruder. Try to minimize corners and turns (even inside PTFE tubes) between the extruder and spool. As a general rule of thumb, don't exceed 180 degrees of cumulative tube curvature in the entire path from the spool to the nozzle. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once your filament feed path is fully enclosed, the filament will be constrained and unable to squeeze out the side or wrap around your drive gear. That's the most important step.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The next problem is simply **loading** the filament. Purging out PLA or ABS with a soft TPE can be challenging because of the force required to purge the old material. Many default loading routines are actually too fast for TPEs and will cause the TPE filament to bunch up rather than purging the previous material. It tends to extrude better when there is nothing else in the way. Some tips:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Do some cold-pulls to clear out the hot end as much as possible before loading the TPE. (Nylon is ideal for this. Preheat to nylon temps, run through some nylon, let the extruder cool to ~180C, and then forcefully pull out the nylon. If you can't pull it out, pull hotter. If it leaves nylon behind, pull colder.)&#xD;&#xA; - If you have a high-melting plastic like PET or nylon in the hot end, purge with a lower-melting solid filament like PLA first. This will reduce the viscosity of the old material when inserting the TPE. &#xD;&#xA; - If your printer has a fixed loading speed, consider making a gcode file with nothing but a preheat and very slow extruder move as a custom loading script. &#xD;&#xA; - If you fail to load and jam up the TPE, try again! Sometimes it takes a few load/unload cycles to get the old material purged and a clean feed going. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The final issue is **print settings**. You ever hear the saying, &quot;you can't push a rope&quot;? That's kind of what you're fighting with TPEs. With a properly constrained feed path, you can push rubber, but not very hard. So minimizing extrusion force is the name of the game.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Print SLOW to start. Like 10mm/s. You can dial it up once you're getting good results. This will minimize nozzle back-pressure and reduce the amount of &quot;pushing a rope&quot; that the extruder drive must do.&#xD;&#xA; - Retract as little as possible. Turn off &quot;optional&quot; retractions in your slicer, such as during layer changes. Some people even print with no retraction at all, and use high travel speeds and coast/wipe features to minimize stringing. That's overkill, but it can help with marginal extruders. I personally add about 50% to my normal ABS/PLA retraction distance. &#xD;&#xA; - Print on the hotter side of the recommended range to start, then dial down the temp as needed to reduce stringing and oozing. Printing hot will reduce nozzle back-pressure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With all that, it should be possible to print the softest TPEs with reasonable success. But if you really can't get it working right, plenty of higher-durometer TPEs are available now that are significantly easier to extrude. " />

I then press the lever to disengage the extruder motor and force the new filament into the hot end until the old color has been purged.

Preheat, load, unload, level bed, etc are all done via the LCD and seamlessly built-in scripts. There is no need to connect host software to do anything but update firmware and change rarely-adjusted settings like acceleration parameters. RepRap-style USB control of Sailfish printers is perfectly functional, but not really necessary 99.9% of the time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a major reason why Sailfish printers have historically been popular for printer farms. They're designed for stand-alone operation, which is highly favorable when the printers greatly outnumber the associated computers. It's extremely rare to see a Sailfish printer from the last 5 years without a 5-button LCD panel. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Sailfish firmware UI/UX is simply built around the LCD buttons rather than host software. This is *generally* more reliable and higher-performance than, say, Marlin via host because it reduces processor time spent on command transmission and eliminates all the possible failure modes in the PC and USB link. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming all Sailfish printers will have LCDs with SD card support and focusing on that one interface really allowed the creation of an overall better printer. More optimization, fewer things that need to be configured by the end-user. But in exchange, you're limited in what kind of hardware Sailfish will support. It's a tradeoff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In comparison, LCD support was more strapped onto RepRaps as an option rather than the core interface element. This tends to produce a host-driven interface design, rather than an LCD-driven interface design. Which is why operating &quot;headless&quot; tends to be more difficult in Marlin, Repetier, etc. " />

There are only a few things that will throw off the thermocouple's reading:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Poor thermal coupling between the tip and the hot block, such as if the tip has partially pulled free of the brass thermowell crimp (this will make the hot block hotter than the reported temp)&#xD;&#xA; - Loss of electrical insulation between the tip and the hot block, plus some ground loop noise or stray voltage on the hot block (this will typically add noise to the reported temp)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should be able to visually check for the first, and test for the second with a multimeter. The resistance between the board end of the thermocouple leads and the brass thermowell at the tip should be infinite / out of range. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To actually check the thermocouple calibration, you have a few options:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Easy:** Look at the behavior of the printed plastic. PLA that is too hot will smell of pancakes/waffles much stronger than normal, or even smell burnt. The printed material may be more shiny than usual. It will string and ooze more as you print.&#xD;&#xA; - **Moderate:** Secure another reference thermocouple (such as might come with a digital multimeter) tightly to the hot block with some Kapton tape, somewhere the aluminum block is exposed. The external TC should read within a few degrees of the printer's TC. (Assuming you get it attached well enough.)&#xD;&#xA; - **Hard:** Place the tip of the TC in boiling water to check if it reads 100C (or slightly lower if you live at a high altitude). Repeat with well-mixed ice water to check if it reads 0C. Both measurements should be within a couple degrees. You will probably need to dismantle much of the extruder to detach the thermocouple for this test.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, again, the problem probably isn't the TC. It's more likely either a bed tramming issue (eg too much gap between nozzle and surface) or the BuildTak is degraded and not adhering. This can happen if you do a large number of prints in the exact same place, or get the surface oily, such as with fingerprints. Try a fresh sheet of buildtak or cleaning it with rubbing alcohol and moving the print to a different location. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some rare cases, low-quality filament or filament stored in very high humidity may not stick well. This is pretty rare though. For the most part, if your nozzle gap is right, any extruded plastic will stick to Buildtak. " />

To make it clog, there must be something that block the path which make the step driver couldn't push the filament through right? even using your hand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This problem is call &quot;heat creep&quot;, especially if you print small detail things. This is because small details make the filament stay inside the nozzle longer, which the heat eventually make the filament swole up and block the path. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To find out if your problem is cause by &quot;heat creep&quot; or not, try to print something small but tall and print something large overall. If it is heat creep, then the small but tall print would immediately clog your nozzle and make the step driver create click sound. If both print ( small and big ) take the same amount of time to clog your nozzle, then it may not cause by &quot;heat creep&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SO HERE the solution for &quot;heat creep.&quot; First and the most important, replace your thermal barrier tube. Second, lower the temperature. Third, check the filament guide components such as the drive gear, bearing, and spring. For example, check the drive gear if it securely screw into the stepper motor. Lastly, check the fan, if it possible, install another fan to cool down the thermal barrier tube. In conclusion, replace your thermal barrier before doing anything else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this help for you and for many other people! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alopicaso!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

First, not all lasers are equally absorbed by the material and the energy converted to heat to vaporize the material. The light not absorbed is reflected right back into your eyes. This is especially dangerous because it doesn't make you go blind instantly, fooling you into thinking there is no harm. You got the other part right, the lower the laser power, the less turned to heat, the longer it takes to cut, the longer you risk exposure to your eyes. That's right, a low powered laser is MORE dangerous than a big one. Next, the only way to properly cut is with air assist. This means a stream of air blows away the vaporized material so the laser can keep cutting deeper. This also prevents fires. The thing we haven't even touched is a proper safety enclosure, proper bed design to not reflect the laser beam back into the laser killing it and your eyes, and finally smoke/particle exhaust. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Simply put, these cheapo DIY lasers are dangerous, and are also illegal." />

Don't do it. Seriously, just don't. **RepRaps are not suitable for laser conversions.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have to worry about reflected light damaging your eyes, and for the blue diode lasers currently growing in popularity, causing skin melanomas. You have to worry about mechanical vibration from jerky motion loosening fasteners. You have to worry about the workpiece catching on fire. You have to worry about the fumes being generated from etching and cutting. You have to worry about firmware freezes locking the laser on. It's dangerous to you, anybody in line of sight of the machine, and your property. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many of the lasers currently being sold for RepRap conversions, particularly from Russia, violate US and EU safety regulations related to power and safety interlocks and should not be on the market at all. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The people posting videos of their RepRap laser conversions are almost always ignorant of proper laser safety requirements and regulations. It's downright scary how much blue flare you can see the camera picking up in a lot of these videos. Don't follow in those people's footsteps. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More directly answering the question details, most people doing light etching or paper cutting type work are using small 0.5-2W diode lasers. These are particularly dangerous because they have poor focus and because they don't have the power to cut cleanly and quickly. That means more fumes, more fire risk, and more damage to the workpiece from edge charring. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Slowing down the laser is not a good solution: dwell time is your enemy. You want a beam powerful enough to near-instantly vaporize the material, not slowly burn it away. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An entry-level proper lasercutter for cutting things like plywood and acrylic is more likely to use a 40w CO2 laser. It should have air assist and fume extraction, and a safety-interlocked enclosure that 100% reflects or absorbs the CO2 laser light wavelength. That basically means a dedicated machine." />

I've found that it is best to stay closer to the lower end of the material's melting point and just a bit above the point. Not only does this help with potential over extrusion, but also shortens the time it takes for the material to cool (refer to the link above). *However*, this could inhibit clogging if your temperature is too low.

You might be able to give and take between temperature and speed. Consider if your nozzle is cooler and your speed is up, bridging gaps might yield the same results as if you proportionately swap these two values. This concept may only matter if you are in a pinch to get the part done. Again, I prefer slowing my machine down as it allows current/previous layers to cool more before continuing.

I'm not completely sure, but I think this depends on the part as well as slicing engine settings. For me, MakerWare is pretty good about proportionately adjusting extrusion steps with layer height, so I see an equal change in the width of the extrusion. I would think that in general, a larger layer height would yield a larger extrusion width. This would be helpful when printing overhangs, but may not be helpful when printing bridges (a larger strand will retain heat longer than a smaller one).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully this helps, please comment if you need more information/clarification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/519/how-to-improve-face-that-are-printed-on-support?answertab=oldest#tab-top" />

You need the plastic to solidify before it has a chance to sag. PLA in particular has to shed a lot of heat before it is fully solid. A fan and air guide setup using a &quot;squirrel-cage&quot; radial blower around the nozzle is optimal. A little 30mm or 40mm axial fan will not provide optimal performance. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Low layer height when slicing is less obvious, but is extremely effective. When you use thinner layers, two things happen:&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;- There is less melted plastic per pass and a higher surface area to volume ratio, so the fresh material cools faster. &#xD;&#xA;- A larger percentage of each strand in the overhang is supported by the previous strand. If you do 0.2mm thick by 0.4mm wide, half of each strand is unsupported. But if you do 0.1mm thick by 0.4mm wide, only a quarter of each strand is unsupported. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you combine these two effects, it is possible to exceed 70 degree overhangs with good surface quality. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another lesser factor is printing shells/perimeters inside-out rather than outside-in. This helps anchor the outermost strand a little better as the overhang is built. This is pretty minor though. " />

Once preheated, the bed's power draw decreases to a lower &quot;holding&quot; level and there is available capacity to do everything else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The start sequencing decreases the max average power draw by a pretty substantial amount. The decrease is about 0.6A each for the XYAB steppers and 1.7A each for two hot ends, totalling 5-6A of avoided peak power draw. (Even lower if you preheat with the steppers disabled rather than idling.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The history here is that one of Makerbot's design decisions with the Replicator 2 and 2x was to utilize off-the-shelf UL-listed power bricks (like a laptop might use) instead of an internal power supply. This made engineering and safety certification much easier, and completely eliminated mains-voltage wiring inside the printer, which is a big safety plus. However, the largest readily-available 24v power brick had slightly less current capacity than optimal. So Makerbot came up with a software workaround for the hardware limitation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want, you can replace the stock power brick with a ~350w PSU and preheat everything at once. Sailfish firmware builds intended for printers with properly-sized PSUs (eg FlashForge Creators) will allow simultaneous preheating. " />

For a device like a 3D printer, I don't like the idea that of my axes can accumulate up to ±0.16 in. of error over 100 pitches (the pitch is between 0.12 in. and 0.25 in. so that is 12 to 25 in.). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Contrast this to a belt where the only way you have a cumulative error is if you skip a tooth and I think the winner is the GT2.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at the non-cumulative pitch error both products are comparable but again the belt wins. For the Synchromesh we have an accuracy of ±0.002 in. versus ±0.0003(1) in. for a 2 mm GT2 belt and ±0.0012(1) in. for a 3 mm GT2 belt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note:** I can't be certain about exact values for error since there are no numbers for the GT2 - only a stupid chart. I also have a hard time believing that error is not a function of total length for both the Synchromesh and the GT2 belt but I'm not the manufacturer. However, since both products are made by the same company I wouldn't be as concerned about them trying to oversell one product over the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*In conclusion, I don't see of any reason to choose a Synchromesh over a belt if your physical layout is compatible with both. As pointed out in the marketing material for the Synchromesh, it can be routed along 3 axes whereas a belt works best along a single axis. The Synchromesh seems to be a product designed for a very specific application...*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sources**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.sdp-si.com/PDFS/Technical-Section-Timing.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.sdp-si.com/PDFS/Synchromesh-Cable-and-Attachment-Inch.pdf" />

The two-rod-plus-screw arrangement is quite over-constrained and thus requires good alignment to move smoothly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some basic troubleshooting steps:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Make sure the screw is not constrained at both ends. It is very difficult to manufacture a screw that is perfectly straight and then mount it so precisely that it can rotate with zero runout. Screws in light-duty linear motion applications should be allowed to &quot;wobble&quot; freely so any bend or runout doesn't apply side-load forces to the Z stage. This can be accomplished by putting a misalignment-tolerant coupler (like an Oldham coupler) on the driven end, and/or leaving the non-driven end free without any support bearing. A motor mount with a small amount of compliance (like a rubber stepper damper) can help when the screw is captive to the motor. &#xD;&#xA; 2. Lubricate the screw and bearings and make sure everything is clean and in good condition. &#xD;&#xA; 3. Allow the Z carriage to self-align the rods and screw. The proper technique for this will depend on the Z stage, but the basic idea is to loosen the rod and screw mounts on either end, run the Z carriage back and forth a few times to push the rods into position, and then only re-tighten the top and bottom hardware when the carriage is at that end. It may also be necessary to loosen the screw nut and bearings on the carriage to get everything aligned properly and smooth-running, but that does not enforce parallelism like loosening the rod and screw mounts, so is really a secondary step. It may be necessary to leave some &quot;float&quot; in one rod or the bearings on one rod (with gravity preloading out any resultant slop) if the hardware has major alignment issues. &#xD;&#xA; 4. If the stage still binds after doing the above, it may be necessary to check if the linear hardware is bent (such as by rolling rods on a flat table) or use a file or Dremel to loosen up the mounts or whatever feature is causing the misalignment.

One motor running at higher current will generally out-perform two motors splitting one driver's current via parallel wiring, because one motor with twice the torque can push much harder when one side of the gantry binds up or hits a rough spot. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only real downside to the single motor, double screw approach is that it requires more engineering and parts. A closed-loop timing belt must be run between the two screws, with associated pulleys, tensioner, and support bearings. In comparison, using a separate motor for each screw is very simple. It adds a stepper and a shaft coupler, but saves a lot of vitamins and design complexity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two-motor, two-screw solutions are lower-cost and simpler to design. That's why they're used. End of story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One-motor, one-screw Mendel style printers are quite rare. The passive side of the Z mechanism does add a little bit of stability to the X stage, but not a lot. It's possible to rack the X stage out of square with the bed and bind up the gantry. In order to work at all, they require a very wide/tall bearing footprint on the driven side to resist torque exerted on the driven side by the weight of the X stage and extruder carriage. So it's true that they don't have synchronization issues, but additional design challenges and undesirable flexure modes are introduced.

When fitting the part to the other object, the &quot;wings&quot; will flex out and relax around the back end of the object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Example 2][2]: T-Slot style designs are a nice choice for semi-permanent or interchangeable parts. The key here is just using trapezoids and make sure the &quot;female&quot; end is slightly larger and/or tapered to make it easier to insert the slides.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Example 3][3]: Create snaps. This can be a bit more difficult, but can provide a more professional look to your design. It's best to start off by designing on L-Shaped slot on the parent part and a smaller L-Shaped extrusion on the child part. Then you can add a taper to the bottom area of the &quot;L&quot; to make it easier to insert into the slot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Example 4][4]: Creating plugs are similar to snaps, they're just circular. Try starting off with a cylinder and joining either a sphere or a slightly larger diameter and tapered cylinder on top. Then you should be able to snap the assembly into a hole that is slightly smaller than the &quot;top&quot; of the plug.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's important to weigh the usefulness of some design choices against the purpose of your part. For me, if I'm designing something for the shop or something that I think I'm going to be swapping out often, I'll use the T-Slot idea. Other things that &quot;looking pretty&quot; is more important, I'll try to hide the connections by designing a type of snap that can go into the walls of the part.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The T-Slot designs seem to print quite easily with no need for supports (depending on how gradual the angles of your trapezoid are) and provides a lot of structural strength.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Printing snaps has been difficult for me in the past and its best not to try to unsnap the part too much as you run the risk of shearing the snap upon removal. Printing such a small feature means that it is usually not marginally strong. However, including multiple snaps in an area and designing them with tight clearances can provide a very neat/clean connection that is appealing for consumer products (for example, phone cases).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:642026&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:993473&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:425979&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:115640" />

How hard is it to pull through? It should only take 1-2 lbs of tension at most. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then do a &quot;tug test&quot; on the extruder. Start it loading and grab the filament by hand to try to stop it from extruding. The Replicator 1/2/2x extruder style can typically pull ~8-10 lbs of tension and it should be fairly difficult to stop the filament. When you do stop the filament, you should hear clicking/thumping from the stepper stalling, NOT quiet grinding as the drive gear chews through the filament. If the grip slips rather than stalls, your extruder hardware needs to be tuned or replaced. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are three common causes of excessive feed tube drag:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Use of polyethylene tubing instead of PTFE -- this makes a shockingly large difference in drag friction. You can use a heat gun or torch (outside!!) to tell the difference between PE and PTFE. PE will soften quickly and then melt fairly easily, whereas PTFE will simply go clear and eventually char without melting. Nylon is also sometimes used for feed tubes with acceptable results, but if you have any suspicion about the tube material, just buy new PTFE tubes from a reputable vendor like McMaster. &#xD;&#xA; - Too many loops/curves in the tube. Total drag friction is an exponential function of the total amount of curvature in the tube. You should have one good U-loop, no spirals or floppy zig-zags. &#xD;&#xA; - Excessive friction on the spool rotation. Any spool back-tension gets greatly magnified through the feed tube per the [capstan equation][1]. This can be caused by a bad spool holder, or if the filament is knotted on the spool due to letting the end of the spool loose during handling. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstan_equation" />

Consider to use a shoe with a flat insole, perhaps even what is commonly called a flip-flop. If your objective is to perfectly match the curve of her foot bottom, this should work. Apply a layer of polymer modeling clay, plasticine or similar material. It should be warm enough to permit her foot/feet to settle in and push enough material away to remove any voids. If voids appear, one could then add a few blobs and repeat the pressure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously some will ooze from the sides, which will have to be trimmed away. Trim a sufficient amount to fit her regular shoes and you'll have a reasonable match of the necessary fit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The resulting shape can then be scanned with a 3d scanner and converted to a 3d model. Even if the clay is excessively thick, the typical 3d model editor can slice away the excess, although one would have to make an almost arbitrary judgement for the location of the slicing plane.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another option comes to mind. There are various silicone molding products. I've used one from makeyourownmolds.com that is of a consistency of frosting. When mixed together and applied, it makes a perfect duplicate of the item, in reverse. Another product sold at the local HobbyLobby is a similar molding compound that is more akin to the modeling clay.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both compounds will release easily from skin, are non-toxic and would provide a more durable model from which to scan. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think one difficulty you may have is how to determine the correct foot pressure and posture to achieve the desired results. The modeling clay would give you more support and probably be more accurate. If your objective is to provide the same support as a bare foot, the silicone molding method would be more accurate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you stretch the concept even further, once you have the silicone or clay mold, you would be able to use the pin-art concept. The idea of measuring each tiny pin is mind-boggling, though." />

Once a mould is made, look into a castable material that will be comfortable, though this may be difficult.&#xD;&#xA; - If you're dedicated towards 3D printing the insole. Try getting hold of a local service that can use a 3D Laser Scanner to get a mesh model. The same service might even be able to create solid model of the desired insole if you have dimensions of the shoe you wish to use. Next, you'll need to contact another service to 3D print the insole (most likely in nylon or similar) or, if you have a 3D printer, print the insole yourself. If you are considering printing yourself, and have not before used a material like nylon, please review the material specifications. Some suppliers recommend the use of a heated build plate with these type of materials to ensure the material properties are retained during heating/cooling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm suggesting Laser Scanning as it will be the most economical and flexible means of reverse engineering the dimensions you're requesting.

A 3D printer extruder is very, very hot, and will easily exceed the ratings of many typical silicone glues in normal service or during a runaway event. (You should always plan for an eventual thermal runaway. They're alarmingly common with cheap kit printers.) Even high-temp glues will not survive the temperatures an extruder can reach at full power if the firmware locks up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Muffler putty is popular for fixing thermistors because it's one of the few widely-available ways of attaching a thermistor that will easily withstand the heat. In fact, it will survive after the aluminum hot block melts. (Yes, that can happen.) But muffler putty is fairly brittle, and has a different coefficient of thermal expansion from aluminum, so there is some risk of the thermistor detaching over time. I really don't recommend puttying thermistors used in extruders -- many people do, but it's less robust and less secure for long-term use than the proper hardware fixing methods found in modern hot block designs like the [E3Dv6][1]. The temperature sensing is sufficiently fast and accurate simply by putting the thermistor into a pocket in the hot block, without any kind of potting around the glass bead. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;High-temp RTV glues are very suitable for heated build plates. Pretty much any RTV (such as from your local automotive repair store) is fine if you just want to attach a thermistor to a plate. However, silicone heaters will require silicone adhesives.

(millions of very small triangles) That is probably a waste on part where it has less details, but that just makes the file a bit bigger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem of best print quality doesn't end there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The slicer looks at the triangfles and creates a 2d image of the intersection of the triangles with the layer hight. It then creates g_COde paths along the lines in this 2d image for every Layer. Using triangles to describe the model will only give small line segments for these 2d slices. Therefore the G-Code creates will only have straight line movements (G0, G1).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With a format that can describe curves, the slicer could end up with circles and arcs on the 2d slice and could then use G2 and G3 moves.

Cleaning the tray should be done also per manufacturer's spec, although each printer's user forum may provide better or more effective options.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Pegasus Touch has a caution regarding dripping resin on the mirrors, so there's operational care considerations for these types of printers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a build platform for these printers. The flatness and level are as critical or more so for resin printers, as the resolution can be astonishingly high. If any portion of a print does not bond to the platform, that entire print will have a failed section, creating an entirely failed print. Gravity is not particularly helpful in that respect, at least with the Pegasus Touch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The release medium varies from device to device. The Pegasus Touch originally used PDMS (silicon release compound) and now uses what's called a SuperVat. The plastic material in the SuperVat is purported to provide better release and fewer failures, along with increased lifespan. PDMS becomes cloudy from repeated printing in the same location and can be torn away from the vat if the print does not properly release.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've become aware of a product from Australia that has had good reports from use in a B9 Creator resin printer. The report indicates that it releases the model quite easily and barely turns cloudy. I have an order pending for this material, as I am hopeful it will perform as described.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The mechanics are also varied. One expects a system to raise and lower the build platform and to direct the laser or illumination system (DLP), but generally, this type of printer is somewhat simpler mechanically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because I live in a hot humid climate, my Pegasus Touch remains in the box, and my brain is about to explode with what I've learned of using it. Environmental conditions are likely to vary with different machines. I've seen references that 70 degrees F is too cold, others that say 70-75 degrees F is just fine, anything higher is too hot. Another user says that 65 degrees is good. The type of resin also becomes an important factor for environmental conditions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The laser will create heat in the resin, so I'm inclined to believe that cooler is better. Different colors require different durations of laser light, somewhat akin to various plastics having different temperatures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;supports and overhangs are important considerations in an SLA or DLP printer, just as they are in FDM.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Expect also that many of the resin printers require that the user purchase only the product provided by the manufacturer. This isn't necessarily a negative as most of the resin sources are priced similarly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If I've missed any part of your question, let me know." />

Here are the major downsides:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Significantly more expensive to operate than FDM printers, in most cases. &#xD;&#xA; - The resin is seriously toxic until fully cured. Fumes can be an issue for users handling raw resin, and you should NEVER put a photopolymer print into a chemically-sensitive environment like an aquarium or children's toy. &#xD;&#xA; - Prints require messy post-processing to rinse off excess resin (usually with rubbing alcohol) and additional UV light exposure to finish hardening the photopolymer. The used alcohol/resin rinse mix is basically hazmat waste. &#xD;&#xA; - In bottom-up printers, the window in the print vat is typically a consumable. Some printers require replacing the vat ($$) after every liter or two of cured resin. (Technology is advancing rapidly here though.)&#xD;&#xA; - The peel mechanism in bottom-up printers is often a major source of print flaws, due to the need to rock/tilt/slide the print to free it from the vat window.&#xD;&#xA; - In top-down printers, you have to pay a large up-front consumables cost to initially fill the resin tank. (There are workarounds here like floating a layer of resin on brine, but these have their own technical issues.)&#xD;&#xA; - If you leave the resin in the printer for an extended period, you'll probably find a hardened layer on the surface from stray light exposure and have to clean out or replace the vat.&#xD;&#xA; - Resin vats/tanks need to be kept clean and free of cured resin debris from failed prints or stray light. &#xD;&#xA; - Every combination of resin chemistry, printer light source, and printer optics requires specific tuning to dial in the photopolymer curing behavior. This means it's somewhat difficult to change resin brands, and you may effectively be locked into the printer manufacturer's resin. Many light sources will change in intensity or develop dim regions over time as they age, which will either harm print quality, require period recalibration, or require frequent light source replacement. &#xD;&#xA; - There is a limited number of options for print materials. Technology here is advancing rapidly, but for the most part, SLA/DLP prints are non-load-bearing models with a limited range of color options. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are some pretty significant &quot;user experience&quot; downsides compared to a consumer desktop FDM printer. It's more hazard, more work, and more cost than FDM. SLA/DLP is primarily advantageous where high resolution or high print speeds are required. " />

This happened after inserting the vial once or twice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think I understand the reason for this. It's because I'm printing in the orientation shown below, in order to avoid the need for supports. (This will be more important later, when I scale it up to an array of many holders.) This means that it's relying on the strength in the z dimension, which is much weaker than in the other two directions, because it relies on the cohesion between the layers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My question is whether I can do anything about this by changing the design of the clips, without abandoning my hope of support-free printing.

I'm printing in ABS.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have tried varying the thickness of the clips. Thinner ones don't break as easily, but they are a bit floppy and aren't very good at keeping the vial vertical.

I then upload/fix the STL file at the netFabb website. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. I then import the STL file into TinkerCad to view it. If there are problems in the file, I can see them. And, I run it through netFabb again. I can also modify the file in TinkerCad. It is no where near as sophisticated as SketchUp. But, it doesn't claim to be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have found that there is a way to export the STL file to 3D printer hubs through TinkerCad. You can see the prices, the material available and the location of the company/person doing the printing. You can contact the printer ahead of time and they can look at your file to give you advice.

If you only preheat the hotend but then turn it off, it will behave exactly as you described (while you're above extrude_mintemp it will behave normally, but once the temperature drops too low it will continue doing the XYZ-moves, but stop extruding). Perhaps you need to add a M109 command to set the temperature properly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;tbm0115 mentions absolute and relative coordinates. Whether absolute or relative coordinates are used is set using the G90/G91 commands and will always be the same for all axes (XYZ and E). He also mentions that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; so perhaps the firmware is attempting to move the stepper motor to the absolute position (which is almost 50% thru your print). This may lead to clogging or skipping depending on how hot your extruder is at that point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This shouldn't happen, as extremely long extrude moves are ignored by Marlin. When the printer encounters&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    G1 F3600 X210.390 Y105.771 E4104.65185&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;it performs only the XYZ-part of the move, but doesn't move the extruder (assuming the printer was reset and the current extruder position is 0). However, it does update the internal value for the extruder position, so the next move happens normally. Perhaps missing the initial extrude segment isn't a big deal, but if you want the print to resume perfectly where you left off, you should add a G92 command to the beginning to initialize the extruder position correctly, for example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    G92 E4104.4&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(but the exact value depends on the last extruder position in the previous layer)." />

I would only recommend this strategy if you are using dissolvable support material, because separating the parts with breakaway supports will be extremely difficult. Next, this strategy is desirable, because it saves support material; however, that is only true if all of the profiles of the parts are very similar to each other (ideally the profile of each part should cover the profile of each part above it).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as you are using the right printer and printing compatible parts, this is a great strategy. It saves space, time, and support material; moreover, stacking parts may also reduce warping due to thermal expansion (a big problem when printing with ABS), because each part acts like a raft for the part above it." />

When heating at maximum power, you should expect the resistor to be 50-100C hotter than the hot block. (It must be hotter than the block in order to transfer heat to the block.) GC 10-8118 is only rated for 200C, but the service conditions at the power resistor may run up to 300-400C depending on power output and desired hot end temp. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For that matter, you may want to question whether the power resistor itself is rated for the &gt;300C temps it will see in normal service. It's probably not. Most modern hot end designs use steel-jacketed heater cartridges instead of power resistors because they can handle higher temps and are, you know, actually designed to be used as heaters. The power resistors used in older hot end designs are generally being operated way past their design ratings. It's kind of amazing they work at all. " />

Then I took apart that part of the printer and examined everything and all I could notice that seemed to be loose was that nut that allows the z motor to push up the x carriage. I don't know if I got a bad nut, or a bad screw, or is it's just supposed to be this way? I thought it was kind of a weird way to build things with a screw turning a nut, because I thought that it would bind up.

The electric field of the trapped electrons adds to the electrons in the floating gate, lowering the window between threshold voltages for zeros vs ones. After sufficient number of rewrite cycles, the difference becomes too small to be recognizable, the cell is stuck in programmed state, and endurance failure occurs. The manufacturers usually specify the maximum number of rewrites being 1 million or more.[5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During storage, the electrons injected into the floating gate may drift through the insulator, especially at increased temperature, and cause charge loss, reverting the cell into erased state. The manufacturers usually guarantee data retention of 10 years or more.[6]&#xD;&#xA;&quot;&#xD;&#xA;on wikipedia here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM#Failure_modes&#xD;&#xA;indicating the answer might be into the millions.&#xD;&#xA;At this point I'm just wondering if an expert might see this and relive my angst.. :)" />

Refer to my Hackaday project for system details &amp; pictures:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sciclone 3D Printer Conversion**&#xD;&#xA;Repurposing a lab-grade liquid handling system to a 3D printer featuring 3 axis, 20 micron bi-directional repeatability on a 14 cubic foot build platform.  https://hackaday.io/project/3212-sciclone-3d-printer-conversion&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have an opportunity to repurpose a high-dollar lab machine into a 3D printer with very high performance capabilities and 14 cubic feet of production volume.  Although FDM is certainly a realistic &quot;no-brainer&quot; capability for this setup, I believe this level of accuracy, speed and volume - not to mention the original cost being well over $100K - justifies a finer level of output and I believe Stereolithography (SLA) is what I'd like to concentrate on.  With such a large printing surface/volume (37&quot;X x 24&quot;Y x 28&quot;Z), I don't know how I would implement a DLP projector to cover such a large surface and still maintain the level of accuracy and resolution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This system is already equipped with the highest quality stepper motors and a &quot;staccato&quot; high-speed driver-controller, an on-board pneumatic &amp; electrical 6-channel controller that could be used for selecting colors, resin injection/flow, resin tank elevation, curing LEDs, temperature/ventilation fans, laser scanning, router speed, etc.  The X &amp; Y movement guide bars are located in the upper deck, moving the Z axis component assembly.  That assembly requires simplification to enable it to be downsized to allow for the printer output to reach closer to the perimeter of the output area, but the weight &amp; bulk of the assembly is greater than any DLP projector that would take its place so this system can reliably perform with a heavier projector if necessary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, I think I'm looking for a software-defined method of coordinating the X &amp; Y movement of the projector's output to the printing surface (presumable a tray of photo-sensitive SLA resin).  Since the projector's proximity to the printing surface must remain relatively close, the output will be constrained to an area significantly smaller than this platform's entire printable surface, the projector's output will have to &quot;play a movie&quot; of the model and instead of projecting still images, I believe it would require an animated output that exposes the resin to build models.  Sort of like a silk screen process but with UV light.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm slightly familiar with the concept of manipulating laser beams using micro mirror aiming devices to draw on SLA resin beds - and this is a possible solution if I knew where to find such a component and how to control it, but that kind of printing would be far too slow for making large-scale models because it would essentially almost as slow as a pen plotter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is anyone aware of an existing method of integrating the &quot;moving picture&quot; method I'm thinking of, or have I envisioned something that hasn't been invented yet?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cheers!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Sciclone-Before Conversion][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/4P3nm.jpg" />

Why I say *yes* is because there are little things that the 3D Printer can come in use for, like creating charger holders or just little household objects. The *no* side of this for me would be because of the cost of the filament in general and the maximum object size you can create with your 3D Printer. I know they have bigger ones out there, but you aren't going to make anything too big. Another reason it's a *no* is because of duration of time. It may save you money, but your going to be spending a lot more time and possibly more money the bigger your objects get, which is the only reason I'm not trying to get one at the moment. I'm choosing to wait until technologies advance to get my personal one, where it doesn't take over an hour to print out a keychain tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So ***yes***, you probably could save money in the long run, depending on what you create with it based on size and how much filament you use, but I'm also going to say ***no*** because of the disadvantages the 3D Printer has.

There are two possible causes for this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The current limit for the stepper driver is set too low, limiting the amount of torque the motor can generate. When the printhead encounters some resistance (for instance due to running into a blob on your model) the motor skips steps, resulting in a displaced model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The current limit for the stepper driver is set too high. The stepper driver will overheat and thermal protection will shut it down temporarily.

It's possible that, if stalled due to excessive load, the stepper motor could skip steps. I have a dual extruder, so if a part curls really bad then the second nozzle gets caught in the print.

I had sliced a model and tried printing over USB connection, however each time I attempted the print I encountered the &quot;shift&quot; at the same exact location. However, using the slice, I exported a G-Code file and printed from the machines SD card with no errors.&#xD;&#xA; - Slicing Engine bug. This is in correlation to the *USB connection* issue. I noticed that the issue occurred after updating my slicing engine. My solution in the long term was to re-install the previous version that was stable for me. I was using MakerWare 2.4.2 and reverted back to MakerWare 2.4.1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're printing via USB connection, I'd suggest exporting to G-Code if you're able to print via SD Card until you can find a stable version of software for your machine.

Its came with a MK8 Extruder, and  I ordered the 0.3mm nozzle with it. I have Repetier v.91 loaded onto the printer right now, and Repetier-Host v1.5.4 on my computer. I have been able to print the test object that came on the SD with ok quality but when I switch to using the computer it just doesn't work at all. It starts up and heats the bed and extruder then zeros out the axis. After coming to temp which I set to 192c for the PLA plastic and bed temp of 60-65c it tries to print. Now comes my problem. It acts as if not enough plastic is being extruded. It doesn't even get the first layer down then when the second layer comes up I notice that there is plastic balling up at the end of the nozzle. So I decided that I should must with the settings in Repetier-Host to see what I could come up with. In printer settings I got everything set up besides the Max Volume Per Sec. How do I figure this number out? I also messed with the settings in slic3r to see if that helped but I didn't notice any difference.

It will have the least flex of any rod (aside from some exotic metals) of the same size. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Carbon fiber's material properties might seem superior at first sight, but the stiffness is very anisotropic -- it's very stiff along the grain and not very stiff across the grain. So multi-axis stresses like bending aren't necessarily going to perform up to the theoretical specs. Carbon fiber has exceptional stiffness-to-weight ratio, but the stiffness-per-area isn't necessarily superior in this application. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;People do occasionally use carbon fiber for linear rods/rails, but only in much larger sizes than 8mm. Think &gt;25mm. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And that's really the problem here. 8mm diameter at 550mm long is well outside what's reasonable for bending stiffness. Bending deflection increases with the CUBE of length, and this is simply far too long for the size of rod. The general rule of thumb for precision motion applications is length &lt; 25*diameter. That's a conservative rule, but it's the right ballpark. You really shouldn't be going over 200-250mm or so with an 8mm rod. " />

Assuming you have a level, flat, semi-coarse (helps) surface for the first layer, the recommended heated bed temperature is 70C for PLA.

There's a good reason almost nobody does it. The main problem is that it's a semi-crystalline material, which means it doesn't follow the normal rules for warping prevention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An amorphous polymer like ABS or PET is able to slowly flow or creep until it cools below the glass point, Tg. This means the stresses caused by thermal contraction will &quot;shake out&quot; above Tg and only start accumulating when the print cools below Tg and fully solidifies. That's why heated build plates are usually set around the glass point for amorphous materials -- there's minimal warping stress in the print at that temp.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, when you extrude semi-crystalline polymers like PE or PP, crystallization starts as soon as the temp drops below the melt point, Tm. A crystalline polymer will not flow or creep at a rate that is meaningful over the duration of an FDM print, so thermal contraction stresses will simply build up more and more as the plastic is cooled farther below Tm. And there's a loooong way to go when cooling from Tm to room temp. As a result, you get HUGE warping stresses with these plastics compared to more typical FDM materials. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**It is simply not possible to pick a heated bed or heated chamber temp that entirely eliminates the tendency of PP to warp. The normal rules we use for amorphous polymers don't apply. And, greatly compounding the problem, PP is a very low-surface-energy material with adhesion behavior fairly similar to wax. It doesn't want to stick to much of anything except itself.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;High warping stress + poor adhesion = bad times. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the simple answer is, polypropylene does not have the correct polymer behavior to be favorable for FDM. You will always be fighting warping. Think carefully about whether you want to struggle with PP or switch to a more suitable material that could accomplish the same design goal for the printed part. Do you really need to use PP? PET blends have similar hardness and chemical resistance, nylon blends have similar toughness, and TPUs can handle living hinge applications. That covers most of the reasons you'd want to use PP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you absolutely must use PP, you're going to need to pull out ALL the tricks people use with traditional high-warp materials like ABS and PC and nylon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Use a build plate made of a close relative of the material you're printing. For example, people have successfully printed HDPE on a PP build plate, so I would imagine that a HDPE build plate should work for PP. &#xD;&#xA; - Or, use a perfboard build plate with a raft so the initial layer will get embedded into the holes.&#xD;&#xA; - Or, use a coarse fibrous surface like stiff cardboard or fiberboard.&#xD;&#xA; - Get the build chamber enclosed and as hot as you can without damaging the printer. 50C is usually reasonable for motors, extruders, etc unless you have PLA printed parts to worry about. (Heated build plates only really help with the bottom 5-10mm of the print if the printer is not enclosed.)&#xD;&#xA; - Use helper disks / mouse ears on corners.&#xD;&#xA; - Really mash the first layer down onto the build plate. &#xD;&#xA; - Print low layer heights, like 0.1mm. Smaller layers mean the thermal contraction applies more shear stress between layers, and less of the large-scale aggregate bending stress that lifts corners. &#xD;&#xA; - Higher print speeds may also help due to some complex strain-crystallization effects, but that's only currently proven in nylon to my knowledge. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another option, if it meets your functional requirements, is to use a fiberglass or carbon fiber composite PP. CFR and GFR plastics usually warp less than virgin plastics. The fibers have a low coefficient of thermal expansion, which makes the composite material contract less as it cools, which reduces warping stress. The most successful PP printing I've ever seen was GFR-PP. But that stuff is hard to find and may not work if the part needs to be flexible. " />

You really just need to keep everything a little bit &quot;wet&quot; with oil or grease and performance will be adequate. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main downside to using grease with sintered bushings is that they will likely stop being &quot;self-lubricating&quot; after the first exposure. The grease tends to clog the pores that allow the sintered bushings' factory oil impregnation to maintain a nice oil film on the sliding surfaces. So the bushings will forever-after require regular re-greasing, just like the ball bearings and threaded rod. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In comparison, a light machine oil like 3-in-one will maintain the sintered bushings' self-lubricating properties, but if used in ball bearings and screws will require very frequent replenishment. And that is certainly an option -- oil DOES work on bearings and screws -- but odds are good that you'll eventually over-oil the bearings, get drips on the build plate, and bang your head against a wall trying to figure out why your prints won't stick all of a sudden. Grease doesn't need to be applied as often, and it tends to stay where you put it rather than dripping. So grease is generally preferred to oil if you have to pick just one lubricant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, the most important thing is to keep sliding and rolling surfaces wet with *something*. You'll just have various maintenance trade-offs with different options. " />

Here are few things to note when attempting to 3D print the tetrahedral honeycomb:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wouldn't recommend trying to 3D print this with a an FDM/FFF printer as you will most likely need supports and there would not be enough strength laterally. You may be able to *print* the design using SLA, but handling would be very difficult before post-processing as the part is very brittle post-print until a heat treat or curing process is done to chemically solidify. The post-process of the SLA could determine how strong the part is (ie. stainless steel powder, infused with bronze in a heat treat process would be good for such a part).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While SLS may be the best method for 3D printing this type of design, for that size part (30x30x10cm) you're looking at an expensive print regardless of whether or not you print it yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead, I would highly recommend finding (or designing your own) a joint connector that would allow you to join wood/plastic dowels in the tetrahedral honeycomb shape. Not only will this be cheaper for you in the long run (easier to replace a few broken segments than an entire 3D printed model), but it could provide more structural strength for something that could potentially get banged around, like a tricopter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, [this model][1] on Thingiverse (not my model) shows an example of how you can utilize 3D printing complex or custom joints that allow you to connect dowels in the shape you're looking for. It'd kind of be like building with [K'Nex][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as designing said joint, you could model a single &quot;inner&quot; joint that has 18 connectors (8 on XY plane, 6 on YZ plane, and 4 on XZ plane).

You never know if the 2nd thermistor is mounted both correctly, or if it is reading the same local temp as the printer thermistor.  IR thermometers have issues with reflective surfaces (like aluminum hot ends and build plates)  Calibrating the thermistor constants from experimental data isn't perfect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IMHO, any hotend/heatbed temp on a DIY setup might be off by a constant +/- 5C or so, more if it is poorly calibrated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Printers use PID controlled heaters to keep oscillations down to a degree or two Celcius, because people say it impacts print quality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there a good visual or experimental way to know whether your temperatures are &quot;correct&quot; for your printer/filament?

It's trial and error. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The temp number your printer reports really doesn't matter. That's just a process control variable: it needs to be consistent and repeatable, but it doesn't need to be accurate against an independent reference. What you should care about is your print results. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some signs your printing temp is too cold:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - PLA printed parts have a dull, matte surface&#xD;&#xA; - Poor layer adhesion&#xD;&#xA; - Extruder stalls or strips the filament at fairly low printing speeds for your extruder and nozzle size&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some signs your printing temp is too hot:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - PLA printed parts have a very shiny surface&#xD;&#xA; - PLA has a very strong sugary/waffle smell, or any material smells burnt&#xD;&#xA; - Stringiness during travel moves that you can't eliminate by tuning retraction&#xD;&#xA; - Excessive oozing while the nozzle is stationary off the print&#xD;&#xA; - Bubbles or cloudiness in extruded strands in extruded strands even with dry filament&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You will also calibrate speeds via trial and error. There are two main speed limits for a printer: how fast the motion mechanism can move the nozzle without running into issues or unacceptable print quality degradation (which is also a function of acceleration settings), and how fast the hot end can heat up and melt filament. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The mechanism speed limits you have to find via trial and error. Pick a test print you like (such as Benchy) and repeat it with different tuning until you find your preferred limits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Melt flow restrictions are slightly more complex, because they are a function of VOLUME flow rate, not commanded speeds. Make a large boxy test print (with long straight lines) and multiply extrusion width times layer height times feedrate. That will give you your approximate flow rate in mm^3/sec. Generally speaking, every extruder + hot end + material combo will have a maximum feasible flow rate. For example, most &quot;average&quot; hobbyist printers with 0.4mm nozzles and good extruders can extrude about 4-8 mm^3/sec with PLA. PTFE-lined hot ends are at the lower end, all-metal hot ends are at the higher end. The value will depend on your hardware. But you can do a few quick benchmarking tests to find the limit, and then use that to determine peak feedrates to avoid exceeding the melt capacity of your system. " />

Now you can measure voltage. You can set the range closer to the expected values then. Usually multimeters have a range around 20 or 30V DC which is propbably what you expect from your power supply. In such a range you should see something like 12.000. If it varies from 12.000 you can then precisely adjust it to get as close as possible to this value. But watch out... cheap power supplies can cheat you. When the are have a load on the output (your 3D printer for example) they can reduce voltage." />

Create a cylinder. This will be the main body of your 'screw'.&#xD;&#xA;2. To make the thread, you need to create a helix primitive. You can edit the number of coils and the coil thickness in the Maya GUI.&#xD;&#xA;3. Once you have the thread, it is a simple matter of performing a couple of boolean operations. The first boolean (union) operation will unite the screw made in step 1 with the thread made in step 2. The second boolean (subtract) operation will cut out the thread from the object within which you want your screw to be driven into. When you print the two models, you should find that the screw nicely turns into the object from which you cut out the thread.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point is: yes, it is easy to do such things in most 3D software packages. Maya comes with a nice selection of default objects you can use, so essentially you need to do no 'modeling' yourself to create something like the example you showed us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your next question, about editing models on Thingiverse. The reason why you cannot edit them easily is because most models there have been decimated and triangulated, which makes them very difficult to reshape or edit because the topology is no longer strictly manifold -- it is just a big mess of triangles! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to edit Thingiverse models, I recommend something like ZBrush. You can import triangulated models and then rebuild the geometry into quads (using DynaMesh, for example), which you can then edit to your liking. Once done, you can simply decimate and re-export as STL or whatever extension you need.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, low/high poly is not so relevant in 3D print outs, especially in mechanically functioning parts. This is because most models are created in high resolution (high polygon count) and then decimated + triangulated down to truncate file sizes. But the functionality and physical feel of the model should not change due to this process - it just takes practice and lots of experimentation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope this helps :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hassan&#xD;&#xA;" />

Now the amperage rating of your power supply gives how much current you can run through your electrical system (as is the flow of your tap/faucet by the pump if you had a limitless big, imigainative one).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The **power** that your supply can deliver is the product of voltage and amperage: P(power) = U(voltage)*I(current).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*What you need to make sure is* that **a) you deliver the correct voltage**, because this is what your circuitry needs to be specifically designed for (image the pressure of your pump being too low or to high, - you either won't recieve any water in the second floor, or your tubing can't stand the pressure) and **b) that you can supply *at least* the needed power** (otherwise you get a problem once you open up all the taps/faucets in your house, because they don't supply as much water as demanded). If your power supply can give more current, that's fine, it might just not be used. And as mentioned by Thetravellingfool already, keep a certain plus for losses and as a reserve, because no pump likes to run constantly at it's limits either ;)" />

Text="As per the detailed answer given by Ryan Carlyle, it can be a trial and error process to determine the optimal settings for your printer.  This certainly does not require absolute accuracy of the temperature sensors(*) or the use of ideal filament to achieve.  In your slicing program it should be possible to *increment* or *alter* the parameters - like 'flow rate' or 'printing temperature' *during* a print of a simple shape - in such a way that is is possible to make subjective comparisons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some enthusiast videos detail a method of using a slicer program to print a simple hollow column and to increment a particular parameter from say 90% to 110% of the &quot;ideal&quot; values in fixed steps every 5 mm in the Z direction.  One can then observe the output and make a subjective determination of the print quality along the length of the column, and adopt the parameter value associated with the position in Z that produced the &quot;best&quot; outcome in terms of finish, strength and layer adhesion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A standard plugin for the free slicer program &quot;Cura&quot; called &quot;TweakAtZ&quot; allows one to generate such a script, and could be a good option even if you normally would use a different slicer.  A user on the youtube site (with which I have no association) detailed this approach in a video titled &quot;How to Find the Perfect Print Settings For Your 3D Printer&quot;.  They went on to recommend this process be undertaken each time a new roll of filament is loaded in the printer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(*) Directly calibrating the accuracy of the indicator for the temperature sensor inside the extruder would be no small feat, and as has been mentioned above would likely be of little value.  If absolutely necessary it would probably best be done with a small gauge wire twisted Type &quot;T&quot; thermocouple wire tip inserted directly into the extruder nozzle if possible.  Using an IR thermometer not would be appropriate due to the size of the target vs the IR thermometer's field of view and the emissivity of the nozzle as you have already observed." />

The cold zone needs to be cool for the extruder to work right. It looks like the cold zone is not staying below the glass point of the plastic, so the filament softens and mashes into a jam. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some common causes of jamming in Replicator 2 extruders:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Printer's environment is too hot. If it's in a hot garage, move it indoors. If you have it inside an enclosure or cabinet, open it up to let it breathe. All-metal extruders with PLA are very sensitive to ambient temp. &#xD;&#xA; - Not having good contact between the heatsink and the cooling bar. Normally, just bolting them together is fine, but a small amount of of thermal grease (like Arctic Silver) smeared over the contact surface can help too.&#xD;&#xA; - Not having the fan pointed the right way. You want the fan to blow ONTO the heatsink: this provides more turbulent flow and better cooling. This means you should not see the fan sticker when everything is assembled.&#xD;&#xA; - Fan dying and and spinning too slow. A new fan can be a good idea. (24v fans only!) Or you can try gently peeling off the fan sticker and adding a single drop of light oil (like 3-in-one) to the bearing, then re-attaching the sticker.&#xD;&#xA; - Using non-stock thermal barrier tubes that do not have the correct internal geometry. Lots of people sell bad tubes that don't have the &quot;secret sauce&quot; (internal diameter step). The four good vendors I'm aware of for this part are Makerbot, [Carl Raffle][1], [Micro Swiss][2], and [Performance 3D][3]. &#xD;&#xA; - &quot;Floating&quot; the thermal barrier threads by tightening jam nuts on both top and bottom of the cooling bar. All-metal extruder designs require good contact pressure between the thermal barrier tube threads and the cooling bar, to ensure maximum heat transfer. The best approach is to put one jam nut below the bar to forcibly push the thermal barrier tube threads into the cooling bar, and no nut on top. (Using just one nut on top is better than two nuts, but worse than one nut below.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's also possible that there is some material partially blocking the nozzle, which is contributing to molten plastic backup up and jamming. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I would recommend right now is removing both the nozzle and thermal barrier tube from the printer, and either replacing them or fully cleaning them out. There are multiple options. You can preheat the hot end with the cooling bar in a vise or on a metal surface with no fans attached, to heat up the plastic in the thermal barrier tube and allow you to push the blockage through with a small allen key. Then do something to REALLY clean it out, like nylon cold-pulls, or cooking the parts in a blue flame such as a torch or gas stove. Then check for internal debris with something like a toothpick. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you can see through the nozzle orifice and there's no junk inside anything, reassemble everything properly and try again. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://shop.raffle.ch/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.micro-swiss.com/#!product-page/cv9c/486618f3-3e55-0d63-e3b0-f94eb2277b58&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.p3-d.com/collections/replacements-parts/products/thermal-barrier-tubes" />

The bars should not only vary in infill percentages, but in also the various infill patterns. Depending on the type of stresses and loads applied, different patterns may be stronger at lower infill rates, for example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, the infill rate should correlate to the thickness of the bottom, top, and sidewalls. This is especially important with ABS when it comes to shrinkage, warping, and delayering. In order for the part to be universally as strong as possible, as the part cools, it must shrink evenly. This is a well known factor for machinists creating molds for injection molding and casting. Otherwise, you may have unintended additional points of weaknesses arise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, if creating tensile bars, make sure to take into account the shrinkage experienced along each axis, for each individual example. I would also suggest cutting each one open, as well as attempting to break a few of the apart (in a very crude way). This could stimulate a lot of thought when designing a part, before printing it.

Infill is really just a way to save time and material. Here are some other ways to potentially increase strength:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Increase your shell. Shell is the number of profile patterns per layer. Typically (in FDM/FFF), each shell is **about** the diameter of your extruder nozzle.&#xD;&#xA; - Increase your floor/roof. Similar to shell, floor/roof refers to the number of layers that make up the &quot;bottom&quot; and &quot;top&quot; of the part with regard to the build plate.&#xD;&#xA; - Print orientation. Pay attention to which areas of the part are susceptible to strain along the &quot;grain&quot; of the layers. Try to rotate your part on the build plate in a way that minimizes potential failure both in print and post-print use.&#xD;&#xA; - Post process. Don't be afraid to do some post-processing to increase the strength. There are [some 3D printers on the market][3] that go as far as including Kevlar strands in the printing process to beef up their prints. However, it may be as simple as just coating the part in an epoxy with some basic finishing techniques. It's a bit more work, but it turns weak 3D printed parts into full production quality prints.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Update:**&#xD;&#xA;Based on some of the comments, it sounds like your best bet might be to find a custom application that can either convert the g-code file into a solid model (try CAM software?), or create a plugin for your CAD software (I know Unigraphics NX and Solidworks allow for this) and essentially recreate your own slicing engine that takes your solid model and generates the same infill pattern dynamically inside.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps look into the works of [Simlab][4] or similar which has a lot of 3D software plugins.

Here's a few things to look out for:&#xA;&#xA; - Is your extruder temperature appropriate for the material? Typical printing temperatures can range anywhere from 200-225c for PLA (depending on the supplier). Often, if the extruder is too hot, the material will bubble or over extrude.&#xA; - Is the material of proper quality? There's a reason MakerBot Industries wants you to use their filament (besides putting their hands in your pocket book), and that is repeatability. They've tested their filament on their hardware and ensured that the material will extrude with regular print settings.&#xA; - Is the material being stored properly? Sometimes people forget to store PLA in a dry place to avoid absorbing moisture in the filament. If moisture is absorbed, it can perform poorly in the print. Indications of moisture can include a slight steam from the extruder and/or bubbles in the extruded material (similar to over heating).&#xA; - Are the fans operating correctly? If the fans aren't running or aren't running enough, the filament begins to heat further up the extrusion assembly (closer to the drive gear) which can inhibit extrusion. I know that MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop has been updated lately with more emphasis on controlling fans for active cooling, so make sure that your fan(s) are operating for duration of the print as necessary.&#xA;&#xA;All and all, your filament is getting too hot. If you can't determine the sudden change, consider printing with a lower extruder temperature from now on. However, if you're using MakerBot filament (or similar quality) then I would definitely verify that your machine is calibrated, wires are fully connected, and settings are double checked. If all is as expected, then you should call MakerBot support (since they're closed source now, they technically have an obligation to help you) especially since the machine is so new." />

When this happens the filament starts bending inside and clogs inside. &#xD;&#xA;This is one case only. You could hear a small repeated noise, also the motor will be extremely hot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit: Also make sure your fans are running at speed. sometimes due to improper wiring it runs at 30-50%. just give it a light tap. The speed difference is visually noticeable." />

And to accelerate and decelerate a motor under load, you need to finely vary their timing.  Back when I/O ports hung directly off processor buses, and operating systems could not prevent programs from speeding up the system hardware timer in order to run a stepper routine rapidly, this worked to a degree.  But today:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Most PC class processors have little, if any directly coupled I/O - especially by the time you get outside the box.  An interface like USB is great for moving a large amount of data per unit time, but it is absolutely horrible for accomplishing a trivial task with precise, frequent timing - it is a freight train, not a bicycle courier.  Many of the things which let a processor internally operate quickly specifically work by decoupling it from an outside world that often cannot keep up - memory caches, bus exchange units, etc.  If you do find a parallel port today, it is likely to be on the far side of a PCI bus bridge at the least, and have a different low-level interface than a legacy one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Modern operating systems have a time-slice scheduler which &quot;owns&quot; the CPU(s) and hands out small chunks of processing time to ordinary programs.  These programs typically get to run often enough to appear responsive to the user, but not frequently enough to accurately drive stepper motors.  There are various schemes which have been tried, for example to create a &quot;hard real time&quot; scheduler which owns the processor, and allows a motor control task to register for precisely needed time slices - then, with whatever time is left over a Linux or Windows or similar kernel is allowed to run, and divide up the remaining time among ordinary programs through its scheduling rules.  Of course, such a scheme tends to need to be revised each time the utilized conventional operating system has a new major release.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While there are ways around these issues, they tend to require atypical hardware and deep changes to the operating system installation - making them neither inexpensive nor easy to setup for end users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead, it is generally simpler and more cost effective (not even $10 these days) to put an embedded processor on an external circuit board, and have it act as a delegate to execute precise-timing tasks on behalf of the host processor.  Somewhat extending from the idea of industrial CNC machines that originally read punched paper tape, and were later updated with a scheme where an ordinary computer &quot;drip feeds&quot; G-code commands over a serial port, modern 3D Printers tend to deliver G-code (or other) command data a little bit in advance of when it is needed, so that the latency of a USB or serial connection doesn't really matter.  Normally enough data is buffered on the printer for it to keep running, but even if not it would only pause briefly between the complete moves which are transmitted, not experience motor stuttering as it would if the USB were trying to deliver each individual step pulse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for why an Arduino - probably mostly the history of who built the machines which kicked off the enthusiast printing trend.  If someone from an industrial background were tasked with building something like an FDM printer or a machine with similar motion needs in isolation today, chances are they would end up with an ARM processor that would be a bit faster, more flexible, and with more resources, and likely cost a little less.  But in actual history, the early affordable machines were built by those in maker community, who were already familiar with the availability of the Arduino, and willing to put some cleverness into getting good motion out of its limitations.  RAMPS in particular seems designed to be a coarse-pitch through-hole bridge that a hobbyist could build themselves, and then buy the slightly trickier to work with surface mount processor and motor drive chips preassembled in the form of an Arduino Mega and stepper drive modules.  That even fairly propriety machines maintain these basic parts choices is probably an indication of the utility of not &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; - if you want to develop a printer, you can start from available components and customize them only one by one as you choose, rather than not being able to run your development prototype until you get a working circuit board designed and fabbed, a working software base developed, etc." />

Delamination or edge/corner cracking is caused by warping stresses when the first layer adhesion is stronger than the interlayer bonding. Or it happens when the heated build plate allows a strong non-warping foundation to be built until the print is too tall to be adequately warmed by the plate. In either case, the corners of the first layer can't lift, so the print cracks elsewhere to relieve the stress. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All ABS warping stress, in turn, is caused by the repeated thermal contraction of the fresh plastic layer at the top of the print. The FDM process sticks hot, expanded plastic onto cool, contracted plastic. When the new layer cools, it tries to contract, but it's stuck to a layer that is already fully cooled/contracted. This generates a large shear stress between the two layers. The accumulation of those shear stresses over many consecutive layers generates a large-scale bending force on the entire print. That's what causes both warping and delamination. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Environment temp is the biggest thing you can control:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If your printer's environment is below 35C, you probably shouldn't even bother printing ABS. &#xD;&#xA; - A 50C environment is significantly better and will have minimal problems with warping and delamination. This is within the ambient temp ratings of most motors and electronics. Air-cooled extruders can typically extrude ABS reliably up to about 60C ambient, at which point they may be prone to clogging. And don't forget about plastic structural parts in your printer.&#xD;&#xA; - Industrial ABS printers with heated build chambers print ABS in a 75-85C environment, with lots of airflow.

Delamination or edge/corner cracking is caused by warping stresses when the first layer adhesion is stronger than the interlayer bonding. Or it happens when the heated build plate allows a strong non-warping foundation to be built until the print is too tall to be adequately warmed by the plate. In either case, the corners of the first layer can't lift, so the print cracks elsewhere to relieve the stress. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All ABS warping stress, in turn, is caused by the repeated thermal contraction of the fresh plastic layer at the top of the print. The FDM process sticks hot, expanded plastic onto cool, contracted plastic. When the new layer cools, it tries to contract, but it's stuck to a layer that is already fully cooled/contracted. This generates a large shear stress between the two layers. The accumulation of those shear stresses over many consecutive layers generates a large-scale bending force on the entire print. That's what causes both warping and delamination. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The less the previous layer cools below the glass point of the plastic, the less thermal contraction it experiences before the next layer goes down, and therefore the less warping stress will accumulate as the *next* layer cools.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Environment temp is the biggest thing you can control:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If your printer's environment is below 35C, you probably shouldn't even bother printing ABS. &#xD;&#xA; - A 50C environment is significantly better and will have minimal problems with warping and delamination. This is within the ambient temp ratings of most motors and electronics. Air-cooled extruders can typically extrude ABS reliably up to about 60C ambient, at which point they may be prone to clogging. And don't forget about plastic structural parts in your printer.&#xD;&#xA; - Industrial ABS printers with heated build chambers print ABS in a 75-85C environment, with lots of airflow. In terms of cooling regimes, ABS in an 80C chamber acts very similar to PLA in a room-temp environment. No warping, but lots of airflow required for good detail. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Printing ABS at a higher nozzle temperature (say 240-250C) will also improve layer adhesion so delamination is less likely to occur.

Now, to figure out a solution...&#xD;&#xA;Take a look at the image below.  There is a 1 inch tube that goes from the heat element to the heat sink.  This 1 inch of tubing is REALLY hot and larger than 1.75mm.  So, the filament goes through that tube on its way to the head and gets soft in the tube because the tube is so hot all the way down to the head.  When the filament gets hot, it melts and bends and curls which makes it NOT push itself into the heated tip and out onto whatever I'm printing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The solution would be to find some way to cool this 1 inch shaft between the heat sink and the heated head so that the filament inside of it won't melt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any ideas??? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Extruder Assembly][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/qKNR5.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/hFkPM.jpg" />

In complicated cases I also add supports in my CAD software. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although a not free, the support generation in [Simplify3D][2] is supposed to be great, allowing for custom placement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also found [this review][3] that compares support settings in Meshmixer, Slic3r and Cura fairly well. Here is the summary:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Meshmixer**&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;This support was the most efficient in material use however it required the most manual tweaking to print properly. In addition the marks it left once removed were more noticeable than Cura and (sometimes) Slic3r. While the settings could probably be further modified to improve the performance this support type appears the most limited for future improvements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Slic3r**&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;The support's performance was variable - by far the best in some situations (fox's head and tale) however the worst to remove with the most obvious marks in other areas of the same model. This may be down to my chosen settings and with some more tweaking I may get better results. The most obvious general flaw is that it does not leave a big enough gap between the support and the unsupported areas of the model (like the foxes legs or the lower roots of the planter)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Cura**&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;While some of the support left marks, overall it was the easiest to generate support which performed consistently well. Once again though slight tweaks could improve this further for specific models. &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Overall Cura wins my &quot;no time to tweak - got to make it work now&quot; award.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.meshmixer.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.simplify3d.com/software/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://blog.think3dprint3d.com/2014/08/slicing-software-printed-support-review.html" />

When the filament gets hot, it melts and bends and curls which makes it NOT push itself into the heated tip and out onto whatever I'm printing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The solution would be to find some way to cool this 1 inch shaft between the heat sink and the heated head so that the filament inside of it won't melt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any ideas??? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Extruder Assembly][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a picture of my heat tip.

Please be aware that printing a object is yet not as easy as printing on paper. The machines that print 3D are more like industrial machines than that they are like your inkjet printer at home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the curious beginner I would suggest to  first concentrate on modelling and printing technique.&#xD;&#xA;#Modeling#&#xD;&#xA;You can of course download things from ThingyVerse or YouMagine but you might be more interested in *making* things than printing them. I don't know Windows 10 3D design. I personally find Sketchup Modeling software a good entry-point because they have a large set of video tutorials and while you learn you can add more complicated extensions to the program. There are also extensions that help you make your model 'watertight' and 'ready for print'.&#xD;&#xA;Of course you can find heaps of tutorials on Youtube for other modeling software like freeCAD or Fusion but you might find it a bit overwhelming.&#xD;&#xA;#Printing#&#xD;&#xA;As suggested in the comments, you could start with letting your objects print by others. It's worth to set aside a small budget for that.&#xD;&#xA;They easiest to design for is [SLS printing][1]. You don't have to worry about overhangs etc. Buying a SLS printer is not an option but you can have it print at multiple printingfarms like Shapeways.&#xD;&#xA;You soon enough find out that making a print 'light' and hollow will save a lot of cash. Shapeways will tell you if there is anything wrong with your design too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A bit harder is FDM printing where layers of threads are stacked. Because overhangs need support, most of the time extra plastic is printed that has to be removed later.  Plastic is not expensive and insides can be printed hollow, so cost is not so much a thing you have to worry about when designing.&#xD;&#xA;On 3Dhubs you can find experienced people who own a printer and want to print for you. They can tell you what is printable and what not. If you have a hub near you this is a good option to get familiar with the technique.&#xD;&#xA;If you did that a couple of times you can decide to go to a fablab or makerspace where you lent/rent a printer. Make yourself familiar with slicing software like Cura before you go. There are many settings like for filling the space in the object and for making support for parts that 'hang in the air'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you buy a printer you probably print mostly with PLA and ABS and all printers can print that.&#xD;&#xA;Even when you own a printer you might sometimes want to print a part at Shapeways because of the material options or to make something that is impossible to print. &#xD;&#xA;3DHubs gives you the possibility to experiment with a large range of printer and materials. Print quality though is often influenced by the experience level of the person printing it so don't deside what printer to buy on these results. 3DHubs has a good printer-guide.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, having a printer yourself makes it a lot easier and more fun to print objects you have downloaded. Also, making something, seeing the result and then adjusting it, is a more organic way to learn and create designs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Welcome to 3D printing ;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.shapeways.com/additive-manufacturing" />

All of the types will be subject to some drift due to vibrations and changes in the printer over usage. Therefore it's the ease of adjustment as well as the accuracy of the stop which counts in the assessment. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my experience the hall effect sensors are the most accurate and easiest. They don't rely on physical switching (as with the mechanical) meaning there is no &quot;wear and tear&quot; on the component and the point of switching will remain fixed. They have a potentiometer which can be adjusted to make the position of the stop change without any mechanical intervention allowing very fine tuning. They can be very accurate. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Optical are similarly accurate but usually have a fixed component that cuts the beam to switch on/off the sensor. The adjustment of the stop will usually be mechanical because the mount points will need to be adjusted - this reduces their accuracy. There are various adjustable mounts to alleviate this on thingyverse or the like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mechanical switches are similar to optical in terms of adjustment with the added inaccuracy of the actual switch mechanism which may degrade over time.

I could be wrong in my concern for some modules that address these kind of issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, if we narrow down between mechanical and magnetic:&#xD;&#xA; - Magnetic would provide a gentler approach, reducing (potentially) the amount of wear&#xD;&#xA; - However, I'm assuming, magnetic switches require &quot;dialing in&quot; depending on the components used in the sensor. This could lead to an undesired range that the sensor is triggered.&#xD;&#xA; - Mechanical switches are simple. They're either touching or not touching (on or off)&#xD;&#xA; - A possible pro (or con) is the ability to manipulate the trigger manually, more easily.

It's possible to have a good mechanical switch or a bad mechanical switch. This is typically a reasonable default choice because it is simple and cheap.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where mechanical switches tend to cause issues is in noise rejection. Different controller boards use different ways of wiring the switch: some use two wires and only send a signal when triggered. When not triggered, the signal wire is left floating or weakly pulled up by the microcontroller, while attached to a long wire that acts as an antenna to pick up EM noise. It is VERY common for heater or stepper wiring to emit nasty EMR due to the PWM current control. Two-wire endstop cables should always be run away from stepper and heater wiring. Shielding and twisting the conductors is a good idea too. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A more robust approach is to use three-wire switches that actively pull the signal line high or low depending on the switch position. These will tend to reject noise better. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Very cheap mechanical switches may fail within the life of the printer. However, most limit switches are rated for millions of cycles, which is unlikely to occur over any normal printer's lifespan. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mechanical switches are easy to align and easy to trigger by hand during troubleshooting. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Optical Switches**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These rely on a flag blocking a window between a light emitter and a detector. This is non-contact and can be quite reliable, but introduces some challenges. The exact trigger position (and thus precision) may depend on ambient light levels in the room, because the sensor is monitoring for light to decrease below a specific intensity. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Switching tends to be more consistent and reliable if the flag enters the window from the side, rather than the top. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Optical switches will actively pull the signal line high or low, and thus have good electrical noise rejection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Hall Effect Switches**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These measure the intensity of the nearby magnetic field and trigger when it exceeds a certain amount in a certain polarity. This is highly precise/repeatable and extremely resistant to noise and environmental conditions. (Unless your printer is next to something that emits large magnetic fields, anyway.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The hall switches I've seen have an adjustable trim pot to tune the trigger distance. That's a nice feature when trying to manually calibrate a Delta or a Z-bed for first layer height. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The primary downside to hall switches is that they need a magnet to trigger the switch. This can be difficult to trigger by hand during troubleshooting, and requires attaching a magnet somewhere on the moving carriage. Glue works fine... but don't glue the magnet in place backwards!" />

How much spread is there in the trigger position? Do environmental changes or machine setting changes affect the trigger position?&#xD;&#xA; - Contact distance: does the switch register with enough clearance to its hard-stop that the homing axis can stop before colliding with something?&#xD;&#xA; - Noise-rejection: does the switch ONLY trigger when it is supposed to? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's important to ask, how much switch precision do we actually need? A typical 3d printer drivetrain using a microstepping stepper motor can only accurately position the moving load within +/- one 1/16th microstep (even if using finer microstepping than that) due to error-inducing effects like friction torque and magnetic detent angle error. That's around +/-0.01mm for most printers. The homing switch only needs to be as precise as the motor's positioning! Nothing is gained by having, say, 0.001mm precision endstops. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This precision of +/-0.01mm is achievable for all types of endstop switches, with proper switch selection and configuration. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then there are three &quot;standard&quot; switching types in use in consumer/hobbyist 3d printers:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Mechanical switches, typically dual NO/NC limit switches, which either pull up or pull down a signal pin by connecting an electrical circuit when triggered&#xD;&#xA; - Optical switches, which use transistors to detect when an obstacle (&quot;flag&quot;) is blocking the window between the emitter and sensor&#xD;&#xA; - Hall effect switches, which use transistors to detect when a magnetic field exceeds a particular field strength cutoff&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Mechanical Switches**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Precision/repeatability depends on the switch quality, length of lever arm attached (longer increases contact distance but is worse for precision), and impact speed of the carriage with the switch. It's possible to have a good mechanical switch or a bad mechanical switch. This is typically a reasonable default choice because it is simple and cheap. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A small mechanical switch with a short lever arm (or the lever arm removed) will generally achieve the required +/-0.01mm switching precision. Very cheap switches, high contact speeds, and long lever arms may provide inadequate resolution for Z homing or probing, but will still be adequate for low-precision X and Y homing purposes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where mechanical switches tend to cause issues is in noise rejection. Different controller boards use different ways of wiring the switch: some use two wires and only send a signal when triggered. When not triggered, the signal wire is left floating or weakly pulled up by the microcontroller, while attached to a long wire that acts as an antenna to pick up EM noise. It is VERY common for heater or stepper wiring to emit nasty EMR due to the PWM current control. Two-wire endstop cables should always be run away from stepper and heater wiring. Shielding and twisting the conductors is a good idea too. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A more robust approach is to use three-wire switches that actively pull the signal line high or low depending on the switch position. These will tend to reject noise better. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Very cheap mechanical switches may fail within the life of the printer. However, most limit switches are rated for millions of cycles, which is unlikely to occur over any normal printer's lifespan. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mechanical switches are easy to align and easy to trigger by hand during troubleshooting. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Optical Switches**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These rely on a flag blocking a window between a light emitter and a detector. This is non-contact and can be quite reliable, but introduces some challenges. The exact trigger position (and thus precision) may depend on ambient light levels in the room, because the sensor is monitoring for light to decrease below a specific intensity. So it may be very repeatable/precise in the short term but have some drift if the sensor moves in and out of the sun through the day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Switching tends to be more consistent and reliable if the flag enters the window from the side, rather than the top. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Optical switches will actively pull the signal line high or low, and thus have good electrical noise rejection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Hall Effect Switches**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These measure the intensity of the nearby magnetic field and trigger when it exceeds a certain amount in a certain polarity. This is highly precise/repeatable (better than +/-0.01mm) and extremely resistant to noise and environmental conditions. (Unless your printer is next to something that emits large magnetic fields, anyway.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The hall switches I've seen have an adjustable trim pot to tune the trigger distance. That's a nice feature when trying to manually calibrate a Delta or a Z-bed for first layer height. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The primary downside to hall switches is that they need a magnet to trigger the switch. This can be difficult to trigger by hand during troubleshooting, and requires attaching a magnet somewhere on the moving carriage. Glue works fine... but don't glue the magnet in place backwards!" />

There are no printable thermoplastics available to consumers/hobbyists that will reliably AND safely contain coffee/tea temperature beverages.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though some plastics may appear mechanically suitable at first sight, there are long-term issues with using thermoplastics for elevated temperature service. The material becomes weaker and less dimensionally stable under load as the temperature approaches the glass point of the polymer. For example, here is some Stratasys test data for ABS strength versus temperature:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even if the plastic survives a few uses, it may creep and warp over time. And that might be fine, depending on your needs! People have printed working coffee cups out of ABS before. For some definition of &quot;working&quot; you can make print a working coffee mug. It's just not going to work at the level of longevity and reliability that people typically expect from hot beverage containers. (Imagine if the handle breaks and pours scalding liquid in your lap.) PLA in particular tends to give out abruptly due to its unusual ability to creep to ultimate failure with very low elongations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then there is the question of whether ANY FDM printed part is ever safe for *repeated* food service use. One-time uses (such as throw-away cookie cutters) might be perfectly fine, but repeated use introduces additional problems because FDM parts are porous. They contain a microscopic void/grain structure that is perfect for trapping food debris and sheltering bacteria. Every FDM part is similar in that regard to an old, scratched, wooden cutting board. They are difficult to effectively sanitize. A high-temp dishwasher cycle will do the job, but that imposes significant thermal stress on thermoplastics. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's an example micrograph I took of voids in a printed part (strands all aligned the same way to highlight the shape):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These voids will also allow liquids to leak unless careful print settings are used. Over-extruding with multiple perimeters, or doing some kind of post-print sealing can make water-tight parts. It's not hard, just takes some experimenting. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also considerable anecdotal evidence that much of the cheap filament from Asia is full of nasty, toxic substances that may leach into hot beverages. Heavy metals like lead, strontrium, and cadmium are often found in thermoplastics as processing aids, pigments, or simply from unscrupulous companies disposing of industrial ashes by mixing them into dark-colored filaments for export. US-made and EU-made filaments seem to be better in this regard. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that the basic issues are out of the way... Here is the breakdown of specific materials you might want to try:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **PLA** blends used in 3d printing will soften and fail almost instantly on contact with hot beverages. (They contain melt-reducers and viscosity modifiers and polymer molecular weights specific to FDM filament and will perform differently from injection-molded PLA products.) It is *possible* to anneal PLA to survive higher temperatures, as this increases the crystallinity of the polymer and thus makes it more heat-stable. However, that is highly experimental and results will vary considerably with filament provider, color/pigment, and annealing process used. Even annealed PLA is unlikely to survive long-term against very hot beverages and dishwasher use.&#xD;&#xA; - **ABS** will become fairly weak at hot beverage temperatures. It may survive use for a while, but is quite weak and will slowly creep with very hot beverages or in a high-temp dishwasher. ABS IS approved for food use in many contexts, despite what many people think, but hot beverages are not one of the approved uses.&#xD;&#xA; - **PET** blends are chemically a pretty good choice -- soda bottles are PET -- but generally have glass points around 70-75C and thus will be weak or fail outright at hot beverage temperatures. It is also important to ask what is being blended into the PET. For example, PETG is &quot;glycol modified&quot; but filament vendors do not share any details about this or reveal how it may affect the polymer's leaching behavior.&#xD;&#xA; - Most **nylons** will creep under load at surprisingly low temperatures, perhaps 50-55C depending on the blend. Nylons are also attacked by acids and will absorb stains and smells from coffee. Nylons also tend to swell/shrink quite dramatically on exposure to water, so mechanical fit and general shape of nylon parts may not be stable enough even for cold beverage service. **Taulman's 910 is probably a good candidate for hot beverage service due to its high working temperature**, but acid attack from coffee exposure may still be an issue in the long run. It's worth trying. &#xD;&#xA; - **Polycarbonate** is thermally stable even in boiling water, so mechanically it is fine, but PC leaches BPA (one of the monomers left over from manufacture) into hot liquids. &#xD;&#xA; - High-temp exotics like Ultem and PEEK aren't printable by consumer/hobbyist printers at the size scale required for a coffee mug. They simply warp too much unless you have an oven for a heated build chamber. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, you *can* make a working coffee mug via FDM printing, but it isn't a great idea. **Your best bet for 3d printing a coffee mug is ordering ceramic printed from an online service bureau.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PN3QJ.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wfYtx.jpg" />

(However, such a short will usually fry the entire controller board to smithereens.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To rule out stray voltage entering the TC wires, completely detach both thermocouples from the hot blocks and lay them out not touching anything metal. Do you still get an unusually high reading on tool 0? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To rule out an issue with the specific thermocouple, swap thermocouples between tool 0 and tool 1 and see if the problem moves with the TCs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the TC is not touching anything, and the problem stays with the tool when you swap wires, and you STILL get &gt;300C reads, the thermocouple amp chip has failed. It is possible to replace the chip if you have (or your friend has) a hot air rework station and some experience soldering. Or you can get a new mainboard from FlashForge. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The next question is why this problem happened. You don't want to fix the symptoms with new parts but have an underlying issue cause the same failure to re-occur after you swap out parts. With the printer on but the heaters off, use a multimeter to check for voltage between the hot block and the printer's ground. Certain types of heater cartridge failure can short the hot block to +24v. This is highly dangerous and needs to be fixed before you continue using the printer. So make sure you check it before trying to repair anything else. " />

Either will work, but there are trade-offs involved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Various considerations that may come into play:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A flat sheet of aluminum has better **stiffness/weight ratio** than a flat sheet of steel. If weight/mass is a concern, such as with a Mendel style moving Y-bed, aluminum may be superior to an equivalent stiffness steel sheet. On the other hand, steel has the superior **stiffness/thickness ratio**, so if the total thickness of the plate is constrained, such as by the printer's mounting hardware, steel may be higher performance. In short, for sheets of equivalent stiffness, aluminum will be thicker but lighter. That may or may not matter for your specific printer. &#xD;&#xA; - Differential thermal expansion can be an issue, depending on what the plate is attached to. For example, rigidly bolting a steel sheet to an aluminum sub-frame will cause the structure to warp when its temperature changes. Likewise for bolting an aluminum sheet to a steel sub-frame. Bed mounts that &quot;float&quot; will not cause warping in either case. &#xD;&#xA; - All kinds of rolled sheet metal may have a tendency to warp when heated/cooled, due to residual stresses and grain alignment effects from manufacture. When people want extreme dimensional stability for the flattest and lowest-warp print bed possible, an aluminum cast tooling plate material such as MIC 6 is usually used. The MIC 6 sheet is then precision ground to be flat. Of course, that adds cost. &#xD;&#xA; - Neither aluminum nor steel is a particularly good *bare* print surface. Either will need some kind of adhesion layer, like Kapton tape or gluestick. The adhesion layer matters far more than the type of metal underneath.&#xD;&#xA; - Aluminum sheets are often used as **heat-spreaders** to even out the bed temperature of heated beds. This is very important when heaters are smaller than the total bed size, or have hot spots. (Most heaters do have hot spots.) Steel is a relatively poor conductor of heat, so the surface of the bed will take longer to heat up and will be less even. That may or may not be an issue, depending on the printer and desired materials. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, it's really a holistic design decision. Aluminum is far more common because of its thermal properties and lower weight, but steel print beds (particularly with permanent adhesion coatings) are often used too. " />

That screws up the extrusion volume. The correct volume calibration procedure for S3D is: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Measure actual average filament diameter and input that&#xD;&#xA; 2. Print a 100% infill calibration cubes&#xD;&#xA; 3. If the print is over-extruded (top or sides bulging), decrease Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again. If the print is under-extruded or looks clean, increase Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Repeat as needed to dial it in. The correct value of Extrusion Multiplier is the largest value that does not produce over-extruded prints. This produces minimum void volume and strong parts.&#xD;&#xA; 5. In the future, that specific material+extruder combination will always have the same extrusion multiplier. You only need to measure and input filament diameter and you will always get accurate volume output. (And if you use high-quality filament with consistent diameter, you don't even really need to measure the diameter.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**COMPLETE ANSWER**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal here is to fill the print volume as completely as possible (at least in the &quot;solid&quot; parts of the print like perimeters, roofs, and floors). Empty space between strands doesn't contribute to part strength. In fact, voids act as failure initiation sites by concentrating stresses. Because extruded strands come out with rounded edges, they have to be **overlapped** to squeeze plastic into gaps and minimize &quot;corner voids.&quot; That looks like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where the bulges overlap, the excess plastic gets pushed into the corners to *mostly* fill the voids. It's very difficult to get 100% packing density, but you can get pretty close if you calibrate volume correctly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You DO NOT want to space the strands without overlap. That makes very weak prints and looks like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To get the right amount of strand overlap, the slicer has to do some math and make some assumptions about how you're calibrating it. This is not uniform between software packages. So it's important to understand what &quot;extrusion width&quot; means to different slicers. For a couple prominent examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Slic3r treats &quot;extrusion width&quot; as the measured outside dimension of a stack of strands. Adjacent strands are then positioned closer together than the nominal width according to a somewhat complicated equation to get sufficient overlap for bonding.&#xD;&#xA; - S3D treats &quot;extrusion width&quot; as the average width of the stack of strands, which is the equivalent width if the plastic strands were extruded as ideal rectangles instead of a stack of ovals. Adjacent strands are positioned 1x nominal extrusion width apart. That provides the correct amount of overlap without any extra math. But each individual strand is really somewhat wider than the nominal &quot;width.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both of these techniques can produce the exact same output if calibrated properly, but they require different calibration techniques because they calculate the plastic volume and adjacent strand spacing different ways. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's important to understand that S3D spaces its strands 1x extrusion width apart. When you use the measured perimeter thickness to calibrate Simplify3D for extrusion width setting = measured thickness, you get under-extruded prints with no strand overlap. **S3D's strands must measure wider than the &quot;width&quot; setting to get the correct overlap.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practice, S3D's code is smart enough to know how this affects print dimenions, and will adjust perimeter positions to get accurate overall dimensions. But single-wall test boxes will be thicker than expected. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The downside to the way Slic3r calculates volume is that it is only accurate for strands that are shaped like ovals. And that is only an accurate assumption when [extrusion width &gt; nozzle width + layer height]. The strand must be wide enough for molten plastic to flow sideways and develop the circular bulge cross-section. So people almost always print with wider strands in Slic3r than is strictly necessary. The volume calculations don't work all that well with thin strands. Whereas S3D's volume calculation method works fine with pretty much any extrusion width greater than layer height and greater than nozzle diameter. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are pros and cons to both systems. You just need to understand the correct calibration technique for each. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/mcSqs.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/WyZkl.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/QGKY6.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/gtCAm.jpg" />

But it does depend on the slicer and settings. Some slicers (like Slic3r) will auto-decimate toolpaths to ensure that the rate of motion commands isn't too difficult for the old, slow 8bit processors in most consumer/hobbyist 3d printers. Having a large number of very small motion commands can bog down these motion controllers and cause pause-stuttering that creates little zits on the print. Most slicers simply reduce model detail level to safeguard the motion controller. Because the contours are decimated to a minimum motion segment length, very small model triangles are irrelevant to printer performance. At the most, they might add a marginal amount of slicing time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, some slicers (like Simplify3d) assume you have the correct level of detail you want in your model, and will pretty faithfully reproduce the model file's contours in the sliced toolpath. If your entire model is very high mesh density / poly count in general, or if your high-density mesh regions are crossed by a layer slice, this can produce a series of very, very short motion commands. Sometimes the motion commands are even smaller than the motion resolution of the printer, and simply take up processor time (to evaluate and drop from the queue) with no benefit to print fidelity. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a more general sense, high-poly models are dramatically more difficult for the 3d printer to reproduce accurately. There are two big issues: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Each motion segment requires some processor time to read/receive, parse, and execute. But the shorter the segment lengths are, the faster the printer runs through them. A short move takes little time to perform but still has the same processor load as a long move. At a certain point, the processor can't keep up, and performance suffers. The printer may run out of queued moves to execute and pause in place, or it may violate acceleration limits and violently clunk through corners (or even lose position) because it didn't have enough time to iterate through the calculations that determine how fast it should move.&#xD;&#xA; - The algorithms used by most consumer/hobbyist 3d printer firmwares (Marlin, Repetier, Sailfish, Smoothieware, etc) are based on GRBL. And without getting into the math, GRBL uses the sharpness of the corners between motion segments to decide how fast to travel through the corner. So a 90 degree turn will trigger a considerable slowdown, while a series of small angles (such as many small segments comprising a curved surface) is not recognized by the algorithm, and it will try to barrel through the curve at full speed. On long, gentle curves, this is fine, but high-poly *tight* curves (such as a filleted edge or organic model detail) are traversed far too fast because no slowdowns are triggered. This means high-poly models must be printed at much lower feedrates / target speeds, because the acceleration algorithm can't figure out when to go fast or slow. Whereas a blocky, low-poly model can be printed much faster and the acceleration code will speed up and slow down as needed for good quality. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are primarily issues with high vertex density versus low vertex density, not variable density. Small pockets of high detail are usually not problematic, as long as they are small enough that the motion planner queue (say, 16 segments) doesn't get filled with too many very small movements. A few small segments in a row is ok, but a few dozen is not. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are limitations baked into the algorithms used by today's slicers and motion controllers. In the future, they may not be so problematic. " />

It's the shape of the lowest energy possible in your situation. Simple but it doesn't explain the issue... or does it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It does.

My bet is you don't have teflon pipe inside the extruder heatsink. So filament goes into the heatsink and everything is ok until the heatsink itself warms up to the temperature when filament becomes soft, then there is no enough force to push the filament out of the nozzle so above the nozzle filament bends and forms the shape of the lowest energy as said.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Options to check:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Take your extruder apart. See if there is a teflon pipe. If its length is proper. &#xD;&#xA; 2. Check if cooling fan is working well, if it's pushing air to the heatsing but not sucks from the heatsink.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**[edit]**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking closer to your photos I'm pretty sure you don't have such teflon pipe.

Not all printers running Marlin ignore large E (extruder) moves.  Gcode has always (even in CNC machines) run commands from were the motors are now, to the value in the gcode line.  For example, G0 X10 will move the X motor 10 units.  The units are set through G20 or G21.  When your machine has lost power, you need to rehome all axis in order for the machine to know where it is.  If you don't, it will likely think that it currently is at 0,0,0,0.  Then when you have the line, G1 F3600 X210.390 Y105.771 E4104.65185 it will try to go from 0,0,0,0 to 210.390, 105.771, 0, 4104.65185 at the feed rate of 3600. Therefore it is always good to home after power loss and add a G92 E4104.4(last line ran before power loss) even if your machine may not need it.  Good habits make for less mistakes. " />

Usually the slicing engine generates the **E** value as an incremental step value throughout the G-Code (at least this was true for Skeinforge and early MakerWare, please verify this). So, if the value is incremental and depending on the controller, this value could be lost or corrupt if a new print is initialized.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would hope, that if you're using a slicing engine's *custom G-Code* input, that the software would be able to compensate situations like this and reformat your provided G-Code to match the value of **E** or any similar command.&lt;/s&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://github.com/daid/Cura/issues/385" />

I was only using MakerBot branded ABS filament, so it wasn't a quality issue for me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I found was that the delrin plunger design that &quot;helps&quot; keep the filament in contact with the drive gear wasn't actually helping. So, I installed the newer assemblies that use a spinning bearing to contact with the filament.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Install (or keep installed) a spring loaded extruder assembly.&#xD;&#xA; - When feeding filament, loosen the spring and gradually tighten until the filament begins feeding on its own.&#xD;&#xA; - Try to stay close to the recommended print temperatures for the material. ABS is typically somewhere around 225C, but it depends on the supplier.&#xD;&#xA; - Ensure your filament is stored in a dry place. This is way more of an issue for PLA, but it doesn't hurt to keep your material protected.&#xD;&#xA; - If it continues, perhaps swap out the drive gear itself. If you've dropped your motor or somehow a burr has developed on any of the teeth, naturally the burr will cut away the material. Gears are very temperamental and should be considered a consumable." />

Try using a small blade to get under a corner of the part and wiggle the part a bit. Careful not to break the blade and send it flying.&#xD;&#xA; - Utilize temperature difference. I already explained this above.&#xD;&#xA; - Use solvents. I didn't know this, but apparently there are solvents in the market that are targeted for 3D printing maintenance. Essentially its just an alcohol-based liquid...&#xD;&#xA; - Use floss. Another cool idea that's related to using a sharp object, using dental floss. Basically, any small object that you can remotely wiggle under the part and give you more leverage to yank on it.&#xD;&#xA; - Invest in a flexible build platform. I've personally heard some mixed reviews on these (in present day of 2016).

For example, the Peachy 3D printer Kickstarter just imploded and failed. There have been many other failed low-cost 3D printer crowdfunding campaigns. Another low cost Kickstarter printer, the 101Hero, is ongoing now (May 2016), but most competent observers I've talked to don't believe it will succeed at delivering working printers to all backers at that price point. If they do deliver, it will be painfully low-cost components and the printer will not perform well or last long. **Stay away from crowdfunding campaigns for your first printer.** At best, you get a beta product with lots of kinks to work out. At worst, you get nothing and lose your money. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For actual products you can purchase today, there's a wide spectrum of quality/cost tradeoffs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Under $200 there's nothing credible. The Tiko ($179) might deliver, but post-Kickstarter units are widely expected to cost more.&#xD;&#xA; - Around $200-300 you get into low-quality Prusa i3 kits from China. These aren't a great value -- most people end up spending another few hundred dollars on upgrades to get them working reliably and with high quaity.&#xD;&#xA; - Around $300-400 you can get an *ok* 3D printer, often with &quot;chipped&quot; proprietary filament so the vendor can make high profits on locked-in consumables. (&quot;Razors and blades&quot; model.) For example, the XYZPrinting Da Vinci Jr is $350 but locks you into high-cost chipped filament. The Wanhao Duplicator i3 is currently a community favorite for value-for-money at $399. The Printrbot Play is much higher quality/reliability but much smaller at the same price. &#xD;&#xA; - If you get up around $600, a big range of decent printers opens up. But this is no longer the &quot;least expensive&quot; option, so I won't get into it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to tinker, the Duplicator i3 is a good choice. If you want a machine that just prints, the Play is a good choice. There are other printers and cheaper printers, but most of what you'll find below $400 is going to end up causing pain unless your goal is simply to tinker with printer troubleshooting and upgrades.

I then compared the desired value of the perimeter's width with the value from the g-code and adjusted the flow rate. I repeated this procedure until I got exactly the thickness I needed. After that, I printed a 15x15x15 mm cube and observed under extrusion on top layer. Also, the dimensions of the cube in the x-y plane were smaller than expected (0.4mm shorter than they should be). I have done this a few times now, and still get the same result. :/ Furthermore, I was unable to adjust width by dividing the desired value of the width of the perimeter by a real value, I got slightly smaller extrusion multiplier (One I got by division is 0.9 , but 9.5 relates to desired width).

That screws up the extrusion volume. The correct volume calibration procedure for S3D is: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Measure actual average filament diameter and input that&#xD;&#xA; 2. Print a 100% infill calibration cubes&#xD;&#xA; 3. If the print is over-extruded (top or sides bulging), decrease Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again. If the print is under-extruded or looks clean, increase Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Repeat as needed to dial it in. The correct value of Extrusion Multiplier is the largest value that does not produce over-extruded prints. This produces minimum void volume and strong parts.&#xD;&#xA; 5. In the future, that specific material+extruder combination will always have the same extrusion multiplier. You only need to measure and input filament diameter and you will always get accurate volume output. (And if you use high-quality filament with consistent diameter, you don't even really need to measure the diameter.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you really want to measure perimeters, you can do 3 perimeters and divide the measurement by 3. That takes into account most of the overlap and will be much closer to accurate than a single-perimeter measurement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**COMPLETE ANSWER**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal here is to fill the print volume as completely as possible (at least in the &quot;solid&quot; parts of the print like perimeters, roofs, and floors). Empty space between strands doesn't contribute to part strength. In fact, voids act as failure initiation sites by concentrating stresses. Because extruded strands come out with rounded edges, they have to be **overlapped** to squeeze plastic into gaps and minimize &quot;corner voids.&quot; That looks like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where the bulges overlap, the excess plastic gets pushed into the corners to *mostly* fill the voids. It's very difficult to get 100% packing density, but you can get pretty close if you calibrate volume correctly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You DO NOT want to space the strands without overlap. That makes very weak prints and looks like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To get the right amount of strand overlap, the slicer has to do some math and make some assumptions about how you're calibrating it. This is not uniform between software packages. So it's important to understand what &quot;extrusion width&quot; means to different slicers. For a couple prominent examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Slic3r treats &quot;extrusion width&quot; as the measured outside dimension of a stack of strands. Adjacent strands are then positioned closer together than the nominal width according to a somewhat complicated equation to get sufficient overlap for bonding.&#xD;&#xA; - S3D treats &quot;extrusion width&quot; as the average width of the stack of strands, which is the equivalent width if the plastic strands were extruded as ideal rectangles instead of a stack of ovals. Adjacent strands are positioned 1x nominal extrusion width apart. That provides the correct amount of overlap without any extra math. But each individual strand is really somewhat wider than the nominal &quot;width.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both of these techniques can produce the exact same output if calibrated properly, but they require different calibration techniques because they calculate the plastic volume and adjacent strand spacing different ways. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's important to understand that S3D spaces its strands 1x extrusion width apart. When you use the measured perimeter thickness to calibrate Simplify3D for extrusion width setting = measured thickness, you get under-extruded prints with no strand overlap. **S3D's strands must measure wider than the &quot;width&quot; setting to get the correct overlap.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practice, S3D's code is smart enough to know how this affects print dimenions, and will adjust perimeter positions to get accurate overall dimensions. But single-wall test boxes will be thicker than expected. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The downside to the way Slic3r calculates volume is that it is only accurate for strands that are shaped like ovals. And that is only an accurate assumption when [extrusion width &gt; nozzle width + layer height]. The strand must be wide enough for molten plastic to flow sideways and develop the circular bulge cross-section. So people almost always print with wider strands in Slic3r than is strictly necessary. The volume calculations don't work all that well with thin strands. Whereas S3D's volume calculation method works fine with pretty much any extrusion width greater than layer height and greater than nozzle diameter. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are pros and cons to both systems. You just need to understand the correct calibration technique for each. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/mcSqs.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/WyZkl.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/QGKY6.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/gtCAm.jpg" />

In fact, whether any particular material is approved by regulators (such as the US FDA) for food contact is much more complex than most people realize. Materials can be accepted for some uses and not others. But there are two major considerations:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Does the material leach into the food, or does the food leach into the material?&#xD;&#xA; 2. Can the material be adequately cleaned and sterilized between repeated food exposures?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whether leaching is a concern will depend on the kind of contact. For example, nylon will absorb acids but is often used for potable water service. ABS is fine for cold foods but not hot foods. PLA (injection grade) is often used for disposable plastic forks and cold beverage cups, but rarely reusable containers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is some anecdotal evidence that lots of 3D printing filaments, particularly cheap Asian filaments, contain toxic chemicals in the pigments and additives. Heavy metals like lead, cadmium, strontium, and all sorts of nasty organic chemicals have been found. You probably WON'T get any meaningful leaching of these chemicals in the brief exposure with cookie dough, but to be safe I would only use reputable US and EU filament manufacturers for food contact. I would also stick to filament colors that use non-toxic pigments (eg plain white is almost always safe titanium dioxide) or no pigments at all (&quot;natural&quot; color). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When it comes to cleaning a cookie cutter for multiple uses, ABS is probably a much better choice than PLA, because ABS can withstand fairly hot water without losing shape. PLA probably won't survive a cycle through the dishwasher. PETG is perhaps a better choice than ABS for longer contact with wet foods, but may or may not survive the dishwasher. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the porous structure of 3D printed parts is a serious problem for cleanliness. The tiny grain structure and voids between extruded strands can act as a safe haven for bacteria between uses. This is particularly an issue with cookie dough containing raw egg. A porous surface for raw-food handling would not be acceptable in a commercial kitchen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, the odds of actually transmitting salmonella via poorly-cleaned cookie cutter may be fairly low. Lots of people cut meat at home on wooden cutting boards (which are also porous) and never get sick. Properly cooking the food immediately after handling will go a long way towards reducing the odds of harmful cross-contamination. You'll have to decide for yourself whether the risk profile is worth it. One-time use is the conservative choice. " />

An un-parallel HBP could result in the object &quot;welding&quot; to the raft.&#xD;&#xA; - Turn down your nozzle temperature. It is likely that the material is hotter than it needs as it is extruding. This results in a slower &quot;cool-down rate&quot;. So, if it takes longer for the filament to cool between the raft and the first layers of the object. Therefore, cooling together in a manner that somewhat binds them.&#xD;&#xA; - Personally, 266C seems VERY high to me. I've primarily only used ABS on my MakerBot and have successfully printed with 225C +-5C nozzle temperature and 110C +-2C HBP temperature.&#xD;&#xA; - Typically you want to extrude slightly above the melting point.

The thermistor in your hotend is not 100% accurate, and may have an offset of a few degrees compared to its actual temperature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Your hotend has a small temperature gradient, the place where the plastic is melted may have a higher/lower temperature compared to the temperature of your thermistor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2 is further exacerbated by&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. As you print faster, you need more heat. The cold filament rapidly moving through your hotend will cool it down locally, meaning that the temperature will be cooler than what the thermistor measures. Faster prints equal bumps in the temperature up to 10C, and for a really slow print you might turn it down 10C from where you normally are.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. This is a minor issue, but different colors of the same material might work better at different temperatures. The pigments used can affect the melting point somewhat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some symptoms may give you a guide as to how to adjust your temperature:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Printing too hot:&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; - Small/slow prints may not solidify quickly enough, leaving you with an ugly blob.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Stringing/bad bridging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Plastic in the heatbreak may soften, leading to clogging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - You might burn/degrade the material (but for this you would really need to go outside of the temperature range).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Printing too cool:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Too much force required to extrude, leading so skipping/grinding of the filament drive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Layer delamination: the plastic needs to be hot enough to partially melt the layer below it and stick to it. Objects printed at a colder temperature tend to be weaker.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, hot prints can sometimes have a more glossy finish than colder prints." />

You may know this material is often used in cutting boards, as it cleans easily and doesn't cut easily.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;it does machine in a manner similar to aluminum, although the tool should be cooled/lubricated to prevent a build-up of melted plastic on the cutting edges. You can get away without coolant or lubricant if cutting speeds are slow and the swarf is cleared away from the cutter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd not considered such a material for constructing a 3d printer, as it's expensive, but I've also not compared the prices to equivalent sizes of aluminum. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd consider that the use in a 3d printer would be a good substitute for lexan, as one can tighten the bolts without fear of cracking. For bolts subject to rotation or vibration, self-locking nuts are a good idea. If you have use of a broach, cutting out a pocket for the nuts would be easily accomplished.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have downloaded the plans for the open-source 3d printer known as DICE, which calls for aluminum, but the pricing I've found was excessive for the right quantities. I think I'll explore the same bill of materials in HDPE or UHMW-PE (which may be different names for the same substance).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Equally useful to know is that the material is very slippery, effectively self-lubricating under the right conditions. Unfortunately, for a 3d printer application, I don't believe the self-lubricating part would work for carriages but might be fun to try with linear slides.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not as stiff as aluminum, so where stiffness is needed and not provided by the architecture, a thicker piece may be indicated. I can just barely bend with my fingers a piece of 3mm (1/8&quot;) a small amount, but cannot do so for aluminum.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's the result of a quick search for UHMWPE:&#xD;&#xA;https://www.interstateplastics.com/Uhmw-Natural-Virgin-Sheet-UHMNV~~SH.php?thickness=0.125&amp;dim2=12&amp;dim3=24 which gives a price for 1/8&quot; white sheet 24 x 12&quot; as US$26.06 while the black version is available only as thin as 1/4&quot; for about US$28.00&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The equivalent size in aluminum 6061T6 at onlinemetals.com is about US$3.00 more expensive. That is lower than I expected, skewing the idea farther away from UHMWPE than one might hope. The equivalent for 1/4&quot; is almost US$60, quite a bit higher. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It would appear that if you need the thicker stuff, the price is better for plastic, not so good for the aluminum." />

Unfortunately, this isn't yet a very economical or simple operation. A decent filament extruder capable of holding acceptable diameter tolerances is around $1000, and even then they can be pretty fidgety to operate. You have to have a LOT of volume throughput in your filament extruder for regrinding to be an economical proposition. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the reasons why recycling prints into filament can be difficult:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Most plastics will degrade to some extent each time they are extruded. (Both by the 3d printer and by the filament extruder.) PLA will thermally degrade with extended exposure to heat. PET will hydrolyze and break down if not meticulously dried to remove moisture prior to heating to the melting temp. (PETG seems to be less prone to hydrolysis damage than plastic bottle PET, but it still happens to a limited degree.) ABS holds up to extrusion conditions better than most, which is part of why it's favored for injection molding, but there's still the potential to affect properties by depleting additives or cooking out plasticizers. **In practice, this means regrinds generally need to be mixed with fresh pellets at some ratio.** That dilutes the degraded or additive-depleted polymer with good material so you can maintain the material properties and performance. &#xD;&#xA; - If you print a variety of different colors, and don't want all your recycled filament to mix and end up a muddy brownish color, it can be difficult to manage the color sorting and matching. Most people don't want different colors along the length of a spool, either. So the regrind has to be mixed evenly in with virgin pellets and a suitable amount of masterbatch colorant to get a reasonable color output. You're not going to run off a new spool with 95% virgin pellets just to recycle a 50 gram failed print, are you? Likewise for material matching. Mixing materials is a bad idea. **If you only print white PLA, this is all pretty easy to manage. But if you print a variety of colors and materials, you've got to set up a material tracking, sorting, and storage operation.** You *can* do it... it's just a hassle. &#xD;&#xA; - Diameter control is difficult. 3D printers need a fairly tight diameter control for reliable performance and good quality. This is really the key challenge in any filament extrusion process. Extruded polymers like to change shape as they extrude and cool due to molecular alignment effects. You can't just push molten plastic out a 1.75mm nozzle -- &quot;die swell&quot; will make the extrudate bulge to a larger diameter immediately upon exiting the nozzle. Then you have to actually *pull* on the soft filament as it cools to carefully draw it down to the right diameter. The way the filament extruder measures diameter and controls tension is the key to getting acceptable results. Most hobbyist/desktop filament extruders have not succeeded at this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those are just the major issues. Filament extrusion is a complex subject with a lot of depth. For a home user of 3d printers, making filament basically becomes a whole second hobby. In my opinion, it only really makes sense in a commercial production printing environment where paid technicians can run the extruder(s) and a very large print throughput makes the pellets+regrind economics much more favorable than just buying new filament. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reducing and reusing are preferable to recycling. Making your printer more reliable and gaining experience with calibration/configuration will reduce the volume of waste produced. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are also some productive uses that let you reuse unwanted prints as-is or &quot;downcycle&quot; them for productive uses. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I personally keep a box of failed prints (and calibration prints and&#xD;&#xA;   no-longer-needed prototypes) as showpieces for people who want to&#xD;&#xA;   learn about 3D printing, and as toys for my nieces and nephews. I strongly recommend doing your calibration prints with a &quot;toy&quot; calibration model like [Benchy][1] or [CaliBlocks][2]. 3D printing is still new enough that people will happily take dozens of Benchies off your hands for the novelty value.&#xD;&#xA; - Failed and unwanted prints can also be used around the workshop for shims, sacrificial&#xD;&#xA;   cushions when clamping or hammering or drilling, or as scrap for experimenting&#xD;&#xA;   with adhesives or post-processing techniques.&#xD;&#xA; - ABS scraps are good for making ABS-slurry as a print bed adhesion treatment&#xD;&#xA;   layer, or for solvent-painting and filling gaps in other prints. Unfortunately, most other filaments do not have such convenient and safe solvents.&#xD;&#xA; - Some people have experimented with putting piles of scrap prints on a cookie sheet in an oven and melting them into multicolor cutting boards. There's a lot you can do with this sort of heavy remelt plate if you get creative. (I personally wouldn't use cheap Asian filaments for food contact though, they often have unpleasant contaminants.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1090268" />

Placing the thermistor in the center the temperature of the center will equal the setpoint, while the edges are cooler than the setpoint. Placing the thermistor at the edge the edge will be at the setpoint while the center will be hotter than the setpoint. Placing the sensor at the center you would need to use a slightly lower setpoint to get the same result compared to having the sensor at the edge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is possible the holes in the PCB are meant for if the PCB is used with a different printer. In any case, soldering the thermistor to the pads and placing it in the hole is acceptable, kapton tape wouldn't be required then (but can't hurt either).

PLA as a material is considered food safe by the 3D printing community, but I have not seen a scientific study on this. However, many filament makers do not extrude pure PLA. Therefore, the answer to your question is that it depends on the manufacturer. You will need to contact the company to know what is in the filament first.

The two main concerns specific to 3D printing are, assuming you start with a filament that is not itself contaminated:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Pores and holes in the printed part which may harbor bacteria&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Impurities introduced into the plastic during the printing process&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I doubt that the silicone mold will capture the pores and holes with sufficient detail to be of any concern (it certainly won't capture the internal structure, only the surface).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That leaves us with 2. It has been noted that brass nozzles contain trace amounts of lead. This lead can contaminate the printed part, which may in turn contaminate your mold, which may in turn contaminate your food. I don't think this is of realistic concern, since we're looking at trace amounts of trace amounts of lead. The nozzle might also have burnt plastic stuck to it (which might be carcinogenic) so you should make sure to do the print with a very clean nozzle and at a temperature that is not too high.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ABS is food safe for contact with cold or room-temperature food. It is however not food safe for contact with hot food, because at higher temperatures the food may leach certain chemicals out of the plastic. Your application is one of low temperature, but silicone is not food and might perhaps leach some contaminants out of the plastic, regardless of temperature. However, this concern is not specific to 3D printing, as it applies to the method of making moulds out of Lego bricks as well. Therefore, making moulds from 3D printed positives does not appear to be different in a food safety perspective from making them out of LEGO blocks." />

You can see this in your gcode if you slice files with different layer heights. *Before you add special slicer settings and offsets,* if you print 0.1mm layers, the nozzle will start at Z=0.1mm, and if you print 0.3mm layers, the nozzle will start at Z=0.3mm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two reasons this is more complex and less reliable than it seems:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Different slicers assume different initial tramming gaps.** And your actual tramming gap may not match that assumption. If the slicer thinks your nozzle is leveled at Z=0 with a real physical gap of 0.1mm to start with, that means gcode Z=0.1mm is actually a 0.2mm gap that must be filled with plastic. So the slicer must compensate by starting lower than the nominal layer height. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what works perfectly for one slicer won't necessarily work correctly for another slicer. And if you tram with a thinner object than the slicer expects (say a post-it note instead of business card) then your first layer will be off.  This is why I personally prefer physical build plate leveling mid-print using screws while watching the strands go down. It bypasses all the assumptions about tramming gaps and just gives you the correct result. (Or you can do the same thing with babystepping in firmware that supports that.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other issue is that **people use lots of weird, ad hoc slicer tricks to get their first layer to stick**. Things like printing the first layer much hotter, or at half speed, or squashed way down and over-extruded, or at 60% layer height, or at 200% extrusion width, will all affect the extrusion volume calibration and the space-filling behavior of the molten plastic flowing onto the bed. The slicer doesn't really have the ability to understand &quot;your&quot; first-layer adhesion recipe. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The combination of incorrect/unknown tramming gap and person-specific first-layer settings is why the slicer can't always get the first layer height and extrusion volume correct across all layer heights. Within some fairly reasonable assumptions, the slicer is smart enough to always correctly relate extruder flow and nozzle position so it fills the space between the nozzle and whatever surface you're printing onto. But if you break those assumptions, it may perform differently for different settings. " />

An alloy commonly made into wire had a difference between the solidus and liquidus temperature of only 50 degrees C.  I determined that one could make a conventional hot end, electrically heated, made of either molybdenum or tungsten.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did not determine how the bronze would behave in the 50 degree solid-to-liquid zone.  I was more concerned about the solubility of the nozzle material in copper, for which I could find very little published data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From my experience welding, and from printing plastics with FDM, there could be a problem with layer adhesion.  To really bond, the cooled material needs to be melted by the material being deposited in the next layer.  This is complicated by the temperature of the cooled material, the thermal conductivity of the material, and the propensity of the material to form oxides. These could be mitigated by heating the object in an inert atmosphere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, to answer the question, I would suggest looking at bronze alloys because they melt at moderate temperatures, and are less prone to oxidation than aluminum alloys." />

This is necessary to develop the proper &quot;cap zone&quot; semi-melt shearing behavior that allows the incoming filament to act like a piston and generate pressure upstream of the nozzle. Pellet extruders have a similar requirement but related to screw/wall shearing rather than filament/wall shearing. If using neither filament nor pellets, such as clay printers, the material must be pumpable by a positive-displacement pump. (It is possible to pump molten metal, but the cost is quite high.)&#xD;&#xA; - It must form some kind of bond with previously-deposited solid material, without needing to be in a state that will rapidly flow and lose shape.&#xD;&#xA; - It must have some combination of low shrinkage, the ability to creep at the printer's ambient temp, and/or low stiffness that allows consecutive layers to be stacked without an unacceptable amount of warping. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Liquid metals tend to have a conflict between &quot;Staying where you put it&quot; and &quot;bonding with the previous layer.&quot; In order for deposited metal to fully bond, the interface material needs to reach the melting point so a true fusion weld occurs.

High density and high heat capacity makes it run fast and cool slowly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pretty much every DIY metal 3d print (such as made by wire-feed MIG welders) ends up looking something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;https://3dprint.com/29944/diy-metal-printing-garage/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In comparison, polymers have long molecular chains that allow them to &quot;diffusion weld&quot; and adhere WITHOUT being fully remelting the interface. Molten liquid plastic will stick to solid plastic quite effectively. The interface only needs to get hot enough for appreciable diffusion to intertwine the molecular chains. This will occur between the glass point and melting point, without true fusion occurring. So you can print molten plastic at a temperature where it will stay in place long enough to harden, and still get good bonding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Metals also tend to be very stiff, which encourages warping. It is difficult to build a heated environment of sufficient temperature to properly stress-relieve the thermal contraction stress as the print progresses, whereas with plastic a heated build plate and warm enclosure can permit warping stresses to start relaxing as the print progresses. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**It is possible to &quot;FDM-style&quot; 3d print filament/wire made of metal alloys that have a wide range between solidus and liquidus.** It has [been done using solder][2] and [similar alloys][3]. However, between the warping stresses, poor layer bonding from inadequate interface re-melting, and use of soft low-melting alloys, **the resulting printed parts will usually end up being weaker than if they had simply been printed in a strong plastic.** For example, PEEK is nearly as strong as aluminum, and carbon fiber or fiberglass composite plastics can exceed metals on various performance metrics. So what's the point of printing with weak, brittle metal alloys?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Over the years, lots of people have tried FDM-style metal printing, but no one has found it worthwhile to pursue in the long run.

More typical DIY metal printing approaches like 3D MIG welding following by cleanup machining will produce better results.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/FTyNd.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MetalPrinting.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://blog.reprap.org/2011/06/new-approach-to-printing-metals.html" />

There is a significant range, particularly when 32bit firmwares and RTOS-based platforms like MachineKit are compared to 8bit firmwares running on Atmega AVRs. Some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Marlin on a 16 MHz 8bit Atmega can only run the stepper interrupt at 10,000 hz without bogging down the processor and blocking other critical algorithms (like motion planning). It can fire step rates up to 40,000 hz by pulsing the step line two or four times per interrupt, which effectively drops the microstep level in software and runs the motors rougher/louder. &#xD;&#xA; - Repetier on the same Atmega can run the stepper interrupt at 12,000 hz, because it is optimized more for execution speed than Marlin.&#xD;&#xA; - Repetier on an 84 MHz 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 can run the stepper interrupt at 80,000 Hz.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*These limits typically only affect actual stepper speed when relatively fine microstepping is used.* Consider an example based on a very typical Marlin printer configuration. Microstepping of at least 1/4 is strongly recommended to avoid resonance issues, so let's start with 1/16 stepping. This allows quad-stepping to effectively output 1/4-steps. Starting with finer microstepping will drop our top speed, and coarser microstepping will be louder and may encounter resonance, so this is a good starting point. Then asssume a typical 32mm-per-rev pulley on a 1.8 degree (200 steps/rev) stepper motor. This system has a resolution of 200*16/32= 100 steps/mm. At 40,000 Hz total stepping rate (quad-stepping at 10,000 Hz) we can theoretically travel at 400 mm/s before hitting Marlin's hard cap. That's probably going to be a higher RPM than we want to run the motor anyway, so it's not a very impactful limit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In comparison, if we started at 1/128 stepping (such as with the THB6128 driver chip) our top speed with 8bit Marlin would be 50 mm/s. That's quite slow. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Firmware motion planners** can further limits motor speed by ramping up and down to traverse turns and corners. If the model geometry has lots of sharp turns, the target speeds commanded by the gcode are likely to never actually be reached. Only long, straight line paths will have enough ramping time to hit the speed target. You can see this yourself by printing a very small model at a variety of feedrates and timing the actual print duration: at a certain point, increases in the commanded speed will make no difference on actual print times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another constraint some firmwares enforce is requiring the ability to safely decelerate to a stop within the length of all the motion commands in the planner queue. This allows the printer to gracefully handle a sudden loss of input, such as as if the host computer stops transmitting USB commands, or if the SD card experiences a series of read errors. If the printer just abruptly stops from full speed when it runs out of commands, it is likely to lose position and ruin the print. Whereas if it can decelerate to a safe stopping speed, it may be able to resume after the command stream resumes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of actual motor behavior, the **inductance and back-EMF** introduce significant limits because they decrease motor torque at higher RPMs. This produces a torque/RPM curve that drops off at higher speeds:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note in the picture that there is a flat &quot;constant current&quot; region on the left side at low speeds. This is the range where the chopping driver is limiting coil current. On the right side of the curve, current is not able to reach the target before it must be switched back off for the next step. That reduces field strength and thus torque.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two separate effects to consider here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Motor coils are inductors, which means there is a first-order lag between applied voltage and coil current. A standard bipolar stepper motor with a microstepping driver must raise the coil current from zero to max or from max to zero every full step (eg every sixteen 1/16th microsteps). At high step rates, there is not enough time to fully charge the coil to its max current before the next step requires dropping the current back down. Without developing full coil current on each step, torque is lost. &#xD;&#xA; - Every motor is also a generator, and spinning the rotor generates back-EMF voltage within the motor coils. That voltage waveform gets overlaid on top of the drive voltage waveform with a phase shift dependent on the rotor position relative to the coil energization position. *In simple terms, this voltage attempts to brake the motor:* it always does whatever will slow the motor down. This means it opposes the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying forward torque, or assists the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying brake torque. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a practical discussion of speed limits, we can simplify the situation by assuming back-EMF voltage opposes the drive voltage applied to the coils. This means there is less effective voltage raising/lowering coil current, and it takes longer for the current to change, and less coil current is developed than would be the case without back-emf. This further depresses the torque/RPM curve of the motor. And when the back-EMF voltage is around the same magnitude as the drive voltage, significant motor instability can result because of complex feedback effects between rotor position and effective coil voltage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can play with these effects using different motor configurations and speeds for a few popular 3D printer stepper drivers using my stepper driver simulator: https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In closed-loop applications with position feedback and high-end drivers that can damp various instability modes, it may be ok to run the stepper all the way down the torque curve at very high RPMs. In more typical open-loop 3D printer applications, it's generally best to stick to the low-RPM part of the torque curve before inductance and back-EMF really take over the motor behavior. Losing too much torque can easily mean skipping steps and losing position, ruining the print. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another important effect for steppers is **mid-band resonance**. This is not a normal mechanical resonance, but actually an electromechanical resonance effect. It's quite complicated, but the short explanation is that a stepper has an intrinsic 90-degree phase shift between position and torque, and when speeds rise to a point where coil inductance introduces an additional 90-degree phase shift between coil current and applied voltage, the electromechanical system has a highly-unstable 180-degree phase lag and thus creates a negative feedback loop. This can rapidly drop motor torque until the motor loses synchronicity with the driver's applied voltage and stalls.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mid-band resonance only occurs when coil current is limited by inductance. It cannot occur in the constant-current drive range because there is not enough phase lag between applied voltage and coil current.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, measured torque curves available from manufacturers almost never show resonance zones, because the curves are produced by loading motors with friction-brakes that damp any kind of resonance effect from building. Whereas a 3D printer drivetrain load is almost entirely inertial (accelerating a mass) which is much more prone to resonance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;High-end drivers can automatically detect and damp mid-band resonance, but typical low-cost 3D printer drivers do not have this capability. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is generally prudent to avoid entering an RPM range where mid-band resonance may occur. This is easily accomplished by sticking to the left side of the torque curve, in the constant-current operating region. This ensures high torque and good stability. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a concrete example, consider the popular Kysan 1124090 stepper with a 24v power supply. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To maintain high torque and avoid mid-band resonance, we would want to keep the RPM to about 400 or less. For the same 32mm-per-rev pulley mentioned above, that would limit speeds to around 200-240 mm/s. Higher speeds are possible, but may encounter reliability issues. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This speed, of course, assumes a 24v PSU is used, to match the measured torque curve: a 12v PSU would have a significantly lower top speed before inductance starts to limit coil current, around half as fast. Higher supply voltage *greatly* increases the top effective speed for the motor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, you can easily simulate this effect (using https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim). This simulator output chart shows how inductance and back-EMF are keeping coil current from reaching the target:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For practical drivetrain design, a motor/driver simulator is really the best tool in the toolbox for finding the point where performance will start to degrade due to inability to hit current targets. It's simply too complex to apply simple equations or rules of thumb with any accuracy. These electrical effects and the firmware step generation limits are likely to be the two main restrictions on motor speed for most printers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, how fast you can melt plastic will tend to limit printing speeds significantly below the true motor speed limits, but that's a different discussion. For the moment, we can simply say that top motor speed tends to be unimportant for print moves in typical Cartesian printers. However, there are a few instances where they are likely to drive printer performance:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Linear Deltas, where carriages may need to run several times faster than the effector for certain move directions&#xD;&#xA; - Geared extruders with high reduction ratio (eg much over 5:1) for high retraction speeds&#xD;&#xA; - Short-pitch lead screws (or all-thread) that need high rotation speeds to achieve moderate linear speeds&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg" />

The main advantage of 3-D printing is the ability to customize each print, rather than requiring large amounts of the same design (as becomes advantageous under mass-production manufacturing methods). In addition, 3-D printing will have structural challenges which are not seen in metallic parts (if that is what you are replicating). " />

Text="Suggested remedies for 3-D printers which are not extruding required amount of filament:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. First, check the temperature of the extruder. Try 220-225C to see if that improves the problem.&#xD;&#xA; 2. The second step is to increase the flow of the filament (increase mm/sec) for extruder speed.&#xD;&#xA; 3. A final step is to increase distance between extruder and base-plate. If the extruder is too close to the baseplate, there may not be enough space for the filament to begin the printing process." />
