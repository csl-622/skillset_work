That's why it's highly unreliable to use HD disks on unmodified Amigas that expect DD disks. On magnetic storage, you cannot maintain the same direction of magnetisation for very long, that's why the raw bits need to be changed after a while and that's also why the encodings (like MFM and GCR) exist. And on HD disks, the bits need to change within a shorter physical length than on DD disks (that's what the substrate is designed for) and that's why they are not interchangable without sacrificing reliability."

Interesting, if true. According to the Tandy Extended Basic manual, RND(0) gives you a series of p-random values between 0 and 1. This implies you can use it similarly to modern language &quot;random&quot; functions." CreationDate="2016-06-11T02:52:03.303" UserId="12" />
