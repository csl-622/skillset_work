Try to keep the alcohol from the plastics; use it sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also fancy contact cleaner used in the electronics industry that works quite nice and is very stable. For example, &quot;CRC QD Contact Cleaner&quot;. Make sure you &lt;strong&gt;don't&lt;/strong&gt; get the type used for lubricating potentiometers. We want the quick drying, stable variety that doesn't leave a residue. This stuff is made for cleaning sensitive electronics and metal connectors. When in doubt, read the datasheet for the product. It'll say things like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ideal for telephones, PCs, relays, &lt;strong&gt;edge connectors&lt;/strong&gt;, tape heads, buss&#xA;  bars, circuits, contacts, printed circuit boards, switches and circuit&#xA;  breakers&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This solution is also good for cleaning out really crufty carts, where the circuit board may be dirty enough to cause an electrical problem. In this case, you can either disassemble the cartridge and clean it gently with rubbing alcohol, or (if the cart is hard to split without breaking it) you can use the contact cleaner to spray inside the cart, letting the liquid run and &quot;boil&quot; (it has a very low boiling point, which is why it works as it does) clear out the cracks in the cart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Good for cleaning keyboards, too. Especially older chiclet style keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be ok for paper labels, etc. to be wetted with contact cleaner, but try not to soak it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, unless you really have to, you probably &lt;strong&gt;don't&lt;/strong&gt; need to clean out the inside of the carts. Maybe if they have been moldering in basement for years and you want to get rid of unsightly splotches or visible dirt. Electrically, everything inside the cart has a good connection (or did at the factory) and cleaning will not help improve that. But, as I say earlier, if cruft is causing what might be an electrical short, causing dodgy behaviour, cleaning the circuit board carefully with the right stuff is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The outsides of the cartridges should be treated the same way they told you in the original packaging material: at most use a damp cloth with regular water (and &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; a little vinegar if you want to freshen them up) and allow to dry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't&lt;/em&gt; use a rubber eraser. This eventually removes the gold or copper cladding on the contact fingers. In a shop I worked at, you'd be read the riot act if you rubbed contacts with &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. And I'll have to disagree with anyone who suggests that paste metal cleaners from the store are useful for anything but the grungiest, filthiest carts, and even then I wouldn't recommend it. These compounds often have gritty lapping material in them, which is all sorts of bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also seen people recommend &lt;em&gt;sandpaper&lt;/em&gt; for stubborn oxide. This would be a mistake, and should not even be considered a last resort. Under few circumstances would oxide be so crufty that it needs grit to remove (and grit causes scratches, which &lt;em&gt;encourages&lt;/em&gt; and promotes further harder to handle oxide). If your carts are this fouled, you are already into Retrounaut Archeology, in which case you are sort of on your own. The rest of us should stick with non-destructive or minimally destructive techniques. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, yes: moist air from your mouth is not great for metals. I understand that blowing into the cart is part of our learned wisdom for getting these things to work, but it's really selection bias at work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="12" LastEditorUserId="12" LastEditDate="2016-04-20T17:40:21.693" LastActivityDate="2016-04-20T17:40:21.693" CommentCount="0" />

The paths on the ribbon are printed with a kind of carbon component, which is &lt;em&gt;brittle&lt;/em&gt;. In particular the fold just above the connector is a place of frequent faults. Inspect it for cracks. If you see any, you will need to obtain a graphite paste, or some other substance used in electronics to fix broken paths through application like paste. Strip the outer layer of the foil with a fine knife (the paths are actually sandwiched between them even if they seem exposed, the foil is really thin), and fix the path with the paste. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then inspect the paths for any more cracks which might have appeared in the process of fixing that broken path...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then fix them too...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then assembly everything before the paste dries up completely, hoping for the best, because it's far more brittle than the paths themselves. Which also means you'll likely have to repeat the procedure every time you open the cover. With the number of broken paths likely climbing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A total pain in the neck, but works... kinda.

It should be visible when looking against a light (bulb etc) - the light will show through the pads.&#xA;In this case the best option is to trim about a millimeter of the ribbon off the end - the pads extend quite a bit above the point of connection, so there's quite a bit of spare room, and the connection will be made with fresh, unscratched part of the pads. Just use either scisors or x-acto knife (or similar), to shorten the ribbon by about a millimeter.

To make sense of the data, it's necessary to figure out where individual bytes start.  This is done with self-sync bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Standard self-sync bytes are &lt;code&gt;FF&lt;/code&gt;, followed by two &quot;invisible&quot; zeroes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; byte 0  **  byte 1  **  byte 2  **&#xA;11111111 00 11111111 00 11111111 00&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Apple II will read bits from the bit stream, sliding them in from right to left, until a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; lands in the high bit of the 8-bit register.  If you start reading from a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, you will read 7 more bits.  If you start reading from a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, you will read 8 or 9 more bits, because the initial zeroes just slide off the left end of the register.  With just a few self-sync bytes, we can ensure that we fall into sync with the byte boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you started reading at an offset of 4 bits into a self-sync pattern:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;....11110011111111001111111100&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The code would read &lt;code&gt;11110011&lt;/code&gt; for the first byte, &lt;code&gt;11111100&lt;/code&gt; for the second, and &lt;code&gt;11111111&lt;/code&gt; for the third -- synchronization achieved.  The extra zeroes are read, but just slide off the left end of the register, because we're waiting for a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to appear in the high bit.  The only way to tell the difference between a self-sync &lt;code&gt;FF&lt;/code&gt;, and a regular &lt;code&gt;FF&lt;/code&gt;, is by how long it takes to read.  With one bit arriving every 4 CPU cycles, detecting the difference is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trick exploited by the bit-slip technique is to follow the self-sync bytes with a pattern that includes additional zeroes between bytes.  For example, consider this stream:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;11100111011100111001110011111100111&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we latch 8-bit bytes as usual, we'll read it like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; byte 0  *  byte 1  **  byte 2   byte 3&#xA;11100111 0 11100111 00 11100111 11100111&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the &quot;extra&quot; &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; bits &quot;between&quot; bytes are ignored, this will be read as &lt;code&gt;E7 E7 E7 E7&lt;/code&gt;.  But what happens if we deliberately stall for 12 cycles, ignoring the first three bits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;xxx **  byte 0  *  byte 1  **  byte 2  ...&#xA;111 00 11101110 0 11100111 00 11111100 111&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We get a different pattern: &lt;code&gt;EE E7 FC&lt;/code&gt;.  By deliberately desynchronizing the stream, the program can detect the shifted pattern.  And because the pattern starts with zeroes, the delay doesn't have to be perfectly cycle-accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Copy programs can pretty reliably detect the difference between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;long&quot; bytes with a carefully timed loop -- either the byte is ready after 32 cycles, or it isn't.  The pattern above uses both 9-bit and 10-bit bytes, so to reproduce it correctly you'd need to accurately detect the difference between a 32-cycle read, a 36-cycle read, and a 40-cycle read.

Recording is resumed pressing PAUSE again. While in macro playback mode, the PAUSE key toggles current macro playing on/off.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ISSUES RESOLVED:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Phantom keys appearing while the user types another key, or key combination does not happen anymore (hopefully). This was causes by the old way to give keytrokes to the ULA. From version 1.3, this method has radically changed. Now, the microcontroller polls the Z80A for IO requests to the ULA port. If there's a IO read request, the microcontroller answer it with theright value. For this reason, a hardware change is needed for the PS/2 adapter, internal version, to work correctly with the newer firmware versions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A little issue with Ctrl-Alt-Del not working correctly on powerup has been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Features present in the firmware version (v1.2):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All alphanumeric keys are mapped to the Spectrum, as well as symbol keys and their shifter forms.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shifted alphabetic keys give the upper case version, as expected. Shifted numbers give the corresponding symbol.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Current keyboard mapping is for the spanish standard 101/102-keys layout keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cursor block maps to the Spectrum cursor keys (i.e. &quot;down&quot; key is mapped to CAPS SHIF+6)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ESC is mapped to the BREAK Spectrum key (CAPS SHIFT+SPACE)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Caps Lock key is mapped to CAPS SHIFT + 2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AltGr key maps to CAPS SHIFT + 9&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The F2 key (which is used mainly to edit the current filename in Windows Explorer and some other applications) maps to the EDIT key (CAPS SHIFT + 1).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Tab key maps to the EXTMODE key (CAPS SHIFT + SYMBOL SHIFT).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Backspace key is mapped to DELETE key (CAPS SHIFT + 0).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Left Control key is mapped to CAPS SHIFT, and right Control key, to SYMBOL SHIFT.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The separate numeric block behaves as if NumLock were always on (in fact, it is).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The ScrollLock key toggles the cursor key mapping between normal use (editing mode) and Sinclair joystick mode. The later is signaled with ScrollLock led on. In Sinclair joystick mode, cursor keys are mapped to the same keys used by the Sinclair port 2 joystick (6,7,8, and 9). Trigger (0 key) is mapped to both Control keys (recalling the standard MAME layout for controls).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the reset pin is connected from the keyboard adapter PCB to the Spectrum, everytime the user presses Crtl-Alt-Del, a low pulse is sent to the reset pin at the Z80, hence enabling the user to reset the machine with the classic three-finger-salute.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adapter has a bult-in mechanism for helping the user to diagnose a malfunction. Upon booting, if Alt+F12 is pressed, a series of keys are &quot;typed-in&quot; automatically. Assuming the K-mode, the sequence typed is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;REM 12345qwertasdfgZXCV67890yuiophjkl*,.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's another, more sophisticated, built-in test, designed to test the compatibility of a specific keyboard. Some of them doesn't allow more than a number of keys being pressed at the same time, or even more than one. This is very important, for example if you want to use the Sinclair joystick mode feature and want to press UP+RIGHT for instance. The test is entered by pressing Alt+F1. Prior to do this, it's better to reset the Spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starting with firmware version 1.1, there is a macro feature, which can be considered in beta state. The user can record up to 6 macros of 512 key strokes each one (a key depressed and released counts as two key strokes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;F3 enters macro recording. After F3, the user has to press the F-key he wants to assign to the macro. Then, CapsLock led goes on, signaling that a macro is being recorded.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From this moment, the user can type anything he wants. If he reaches the keystroke limit, the recording is automatically ended.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To stop a macro recording, press F4. CapsLock led goes off.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To play the macro, simply press the F-key assigned to it. Caps Lock led goes on to signal macro play. A macro cannot be stopped unless Ctrl-Alt-Del is pressed. If the user resets the Spectrum using the lateral switch, macro playing won't stop.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="105" LastEditorUserId="105" LastEditDate="2016-04-20T17:58:11.543" LastActivityDate="2016-04-20T17:58:11.543" CommentCount="7" />

The files just hold a copy of the disk data, from the first track to the last, as read by the operating system.  The way in which the data is read from the physical floppy determines the ordering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your disk imaging program runs under DOS 3.3, it will start at track 0 sector 0 (t0s0), reading 256 bytes.  It continues on that track through t0s15, then advances to the next track (t1s0).  It stops when it reaches t34s15.  If an emulator wants to read (say) track 10 sector 7, it seeks to file offset &lt;code&gt;(10 * 16 + 7) * 256 = 42752&lt;/code&gt; and reads 256 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your disk imaging program runs under ProDOS, it will start at block 0, reading 512 bytes, and continue through block 279.  If an emulator wants to read block 100, it seeks to offset &lt;code&gt;(100 * 512) = 51200&lt;/code&gt;, and reads 512 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trouble comes because the 512-byte ProDOS blocks don't map neatly on top of DOS 3.3 sectors.  While 5.25&quot; ProDOS disks still use the same 256-byte sector structure in the low-level disk format, the higher-level blocks are mapped across non-adjacent sectors.  ProDOS block 0 occupies sectors 0 and 2, not 0 and 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If an emulator wants to read track 0 sector 1 from a DOS-ordered disk, it can do trivial math (&lt;code&gt;(0 * 16 + 1) * 256&lt;/code&gt;) and seek to offset 256.  For a ProDOS ordered disk, that sector is actually the first half of block four, so the emulator would seek to offset &lt;code&gt;4 * 512 = 2048&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Various disk imaging programs are available, some written for DOS, some for ProDOS.  Because neither format was widely accepted as the One True Way, emulators have to cope with both.  In many cases the format can be auto-detected, but it's generally best to use file extensions to identify the format (&lt;code&gt;.po&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;.do&lt;/code&gt;).  Fortunately the sector/block conversion can be managed with a simple lookup table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many emulators also support &quot;nibble&quot; images, which contain the raw bytes as read from the drive, one track at a time.  The track format contains sector numbers in the address header fields, so there is no ambiguity about the ordering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The order in which sectors physically appear on a track is irrelevant except for performance.  Tools like Bag of Tricks allowed one to &quot;skew&quot; the sectors in a way that made reads of consecutive sectors faster.  DOS 3.3 wasn't fast enough to read the track in a single revolution, so the idea was to interleave the data such that, at the point DOS had finished reading and processing sector N, sector N+1 was about to pass under the drive head.  Because the sectors were explicitly numbered in the address field, this was invisible to DOS and ProDOS, and has no effect on disk images.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="56" LastActivityDate="2016-04-20T00:29:12.747" CommentCount="0" />

You can see it used in the main part of the interpreter loop at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/firmware/computers/pet/d/rom-1.html#C6B5&quot;&gt;address &lt;code&gt;C6B5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why this routine was placed in zero page. It's a cycle (or rarely two) faster to use &lt;code&gt;LDA $0400&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;LDA ($C9),Y&lt;/code&gt;, but I can't see it actually making much difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I should also note that the ROM disassembly you're looking at appears to be for a BASIC 1.0 ROM, while the memory map you've referenced is for versions 2.0 and 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's what &lt;a href=&quot;http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/project64/mapping_c64.html&quot;&gt;Mapping the Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt; by Sheldon Leemon says about the equivalent C64 routine:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;115-138 &amp;nbsp; $73-$8A  &amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;CHRGET&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt; Subroutine: Get Next BASIC Text Character&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CHRGET&lt;/code&gt; is a crucial routine which BASIC uses to read text characters,&#xA;  such as the text of the BASIC program which is being interpreted. It&#xA;  is placed on zero page to make the routine run faster. Since it keeps&#xA;  track of the address of the character being read within the routine&#xA;  itself, the routine must be in RAM in order to update that pointer.&#xA;  The pointer to the address of the byte currently being read is really&#xA;  the operand of a &lt;code&gt;LDA&lt;/code&gt; instruction. When entered from &lt;code&gt;CHRGET&lt;/code&gt;, the&#xA;  routine increments the pointer by modifying the operand at &lt;code&gt;TXTPTR&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  (122, &lt;code&gt;$7A&lt;/code&gt;), thus allowing the next character to be read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Entry at &lt;code&gt;CHRGOT&lt;/code&gt; (121, &lt;code&gt;$79&lt;/code&gt;) allows the current character to be read&#xA;  again.  The &lt;code&gt;CHRGET&lt;/code&gt; routine skips spaces, sets the various flags or the&#xA;  status register (&lt;code&gt;.P&lt;/code&gt;) to indicate whether the character read was a&#xA;  digit, statement terminator, or other type of character, and returns&#xA;  with the retrieved character in the Accumulator (&lt;code&gt;.A&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As this is such a central routine, a disassembly listing is given&#xA;  below to provide a better understanding of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;115 $73   CHRGET  INC TXTPTR   ; increment low byte of TXTPTR&#xA;117 $75           BNE CHRGOT   ; if low byte isn't 0, skip next&#xA;119 $77           INC TXTPTR+1 ; increment high byte of TXTPTR&#xA;121 $79   CHRGOT  LDA          ; load byte from where TXTPTR points&#xA;                               ; entry here does not update TXTPTR,&#xA;                               ; allowing you to readl the old byte again&#xA;122 $7A   TXTPTR  $0207        ; pointer is really the LDA operand&#xA;                               ; TXTPTR+1 points to 512-580 ($200-$250)&#xA;                               ; when reading from the input buffer&#xA;                               ; in direct mode&#xA;124 $7C   POINTB  CMP #$3A     ; carry flag set if &amp;gt; ASCII numeral 9&#xA;126 $7E           BCS EXIT     ; character is not a numeral--exit&#xA;128 $80           CMP #$20     ; if it is an ASCII space...&#xA;130 $82           BEQ CHRGET   ; ignore it and get next character&#xA;132 $84           SEC          ; prepare to subtract&#xA;133 $85           SBC #$30     ; ASCII 0-9 are between 48-57 ($30-$39)&#xA;135 $87           SEC          ; prepare to subtract again&#xA;136 $88           SBC #$D0     ; if &amp;lt; ASCII 0 (57, $39) then carry is set&#xA;138 $8A   EXIT    RTS          ; carry is clear only for numeral on return&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Accumulator (&lt;code&gt;.A&lt;/code&gt; register) holds the character that was read on&#xA;  exit from the routine.

But there are some parts of your computer that you don't want to speed up, and NTSC (or PAL) video output is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order for C64 output to be displayed correctly on an NTSC/PAL monitor, it needs to be sent to the monitor at a very specific rate (the rate at which your computer sends needs to match the rate your monitor expects to receive).  Speeding it up or slowing it down will make it difficult or impossible for your monitor to maintain sync.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leads to a problem on the C64, because the same clock is used to drive both the CPU and the VIC video chip.  The end result is you can't speed up the CPU clock without also speeding up the VIC clock, and speeding up the VIC clock will affect your display.  So for practical purposes overclocking isn't really an option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is an option is to use a faster coprocessor, a completely separate processor that can access the same memory.  Such a processor would need to include a circuit that separates the internal CPU clock from the memory access clock, so that the CPU can go faster without affecting memory access time (which needs to stay the same to avoid colliding with VIC chip memory accesses).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern PCs are much more suited to overclocking because busses are designed to allow components running at different speeds to work together, via sets of 'request' and 'ready' lines.  It's expected in such busses that faster devices will need to wait for slower ones.  Overclocking is then simply a matter of taking hardware that runs at 'less different' speeds, and making it run at 'more different' speeds instead.  Since modern designs already make allowances for different speed devices to work together, this typically works fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The C64 memory bus is designed to have only 2 participants, the CPU and the VIC chip and they must both run at exactly the same speed because the 'bus protocol' is very simply 'take turns'.  There are no allowances or features in the design to allow one to run faster than the other.  This reduced the cost to manufacture the computer, but also made it harder to mod.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="70" LastActivityDate="2016-04-20T20:21:53.813" CommentCount="5" />

If the impedance at some of these pins is too low or too high, they may be read as N/C or GND.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quoting &lt;a href=&quot;http://pinouts.ru/Video/Vga15_pinout.shtml&quot;&gt;http://pinouts.ru/Video/Vga15_pinout.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ID pins set-up&#xA;&#xA;4    11   12&#xA;ID2  ID0  ID1&#xA;&#xA;n/c  n/c  n/c   no monitor&#xA;n/c  n/c  GND   Mono monitor which does not support 1024x768&#xA;n/c  GND  n/c   Color monitor which does not support 1024x768&#xA;GND  GND  n/c   Color monitor which supports 1024x768&#xA;&#xA;GND means connected to ground&#xA;n/c means that the pin is not connected anywhere&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this is happening, the VGA BIOS will reprogram the internal palette to show gray shades instead of colors. To find out if this is so, you can test this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without starting Windows (that is, in &quot;pure&quot; DOS mode), execute debug&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\&amp;gt;debug&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And enter these commands at the &lt;code&gt;debug&lt;/code&gt; command prompt (a dash):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-o 3c7,0&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is to select DAC palette registers for read. Now, repeat the following command three times to get the R,G and B information for each palette entry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-i 3c9&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After entering the i command, debug will return the byte at that I/O port address, as in this example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-i 3c9&#xA;00&#xA;-i 3c9&#xA;00&#xA;-i 3c9&#xA;00&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first palette entry is therefore RGB(0,0,0). Do it a second time&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-i 3c9&#xA;00&#xA;-i 3c9&#xA;00&#xA;-i 3c9&#xA;2A&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My second palette entry is RGB(0,0,2A), which gives me a dark blue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you continue doing this, you will get the RGB values associated to each palette entry. A VGA card programmed with a grayscale palette will show identical values in R,G and B for each non-black color. For example, the second palette entry may show like this in a B/W setup:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-i 3c9&#xA;05&#xA;-i 3c9&#xA;05&#xA;-i 3c9&#xA;05&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is roughly the grayscale shade equivalent to the original dark blue color.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quit debug, just enter &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; at the debug command prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If with this test you conclude that your monitor is reporting itself as a B/W monitor to your VGA, a solution would be to take a VGA extension cable and wire it so pins 4 and 11 at the VGA card side go to GND, and pin 12 is left unconnected. On the VGA monitor side, these pins may be unconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="105" LastActivityDate="2016-04-21T06:58:11.687" CommentCount="5" />

Some people  may use this&#xA; register to keep constant value (V for value).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MD register&#xA; This is a 8 bit register to keep the mode and status of the chip.&#xA; The meaning of each bit is as follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Read value&#xA;    bit 7  ---  1 is set if zero division happen.&#xA;    bit 6  ---  1 is set if illegal instruction is fetched.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Write value &#xA;    bit 1  ---  The mode for FIRQ interrupt.&#xA;                0 -&gt; the the action for FIRQ is the same as that&#xA;                     of 6809.&#xA;                1 -&gt; the the action for FIRQ is the same as IRQ.&#xA;    bit 0  ---  The execution mode of 6309.&#xA;                0 -&gt; the emulation mode.&#xA;                1 -&gt; the native mode.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(When the chip is reseted, all bits are 0.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 6309 has two modes, emulation mode and native mode, as described&#xA;in the previous section.  When the chip is reseted, the initial mode&#xA;of 6309 is the emulation mode. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the 6309 is in the emulation mode, the chip emulates the action&#xA;of 6809.  But we can use extended registers and extended operations in&#xA;this mode.  The 6309 executes instructions in the same cycles as 6809&#xA;does.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the 6309 is in the native mode, it executes instructions in&#xA;less cycles. And when the chip is interrupted (IRQ, for example), &#xA;it pushes extended registers (PC, U, Y, X, DP, W, D, CC, in this&#xA;order).  If you want to use the 6309, you must rewrite interrupt&#xA;handling routine (for example, the entry of system call of OS9).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NEW INSTRUCTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Register Addressing Mode&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To specify registers in TFR and EXG, the 6809 uses bit pattern of 4 bits. &#xA;New registers of the 6309 are specified by bit patterns in TFR and EXG&#xA;operations. In addition to that, the bit pattern is also used in&#xA;instructions of inter-register operations.  We call this bit pattern&#xA;used to specify register &quot;register addressing mode&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bit patterns for new registres are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;W  -&amp;gt;  0110,&#xA;V  -&amp;gt;  0111,&#xA;E  -&amp;gt;  1110,&#xA;F  -&amp;gt;  1111.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: even if the 6309 is in a emulation mode, the action for TFR of 6309 &#xA;is different from that of the 6809 if new register is specified in&#xA;operand.  Some hackers found this fact and they guessed that the 6309&#xA;has secret registers. At last, they found many features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inter-Register Operations&#xA;Operations of 6809 are operations between register and immediate value&#xA;or between register and memory.  Therefore, we had to store value of &#xA;register on memory if opetation between two registers is necessary.&#xA;  But the 6309 has inter-register operation. Following operations are &#xA;provided:&#xA;    ADDR r0,r1  (ADD of two registers),&#xA;    ADCR r0,r1  (ADC of two registers),&#xA;    SUBR r0,r1  (SUB of two registers),&#xA;    SBCR r0,r1  (SBC of two registers),&#xA;    ANDR r0,r1  (AND of two registers),&#xA;    ORR  r0,r1  (OR of two registers),&#xA;    EORR r0,r1  (EOR of two registers),&#xA;    CMPR r0,r1  (CMP of two registers).&#xA;The register addressing mode is used to specify two registers.&#xA;(I do not remember exactrlly but the result is stored in r0, the&#xA;register of the first operand. Please try and find the behavior of&#xA;these instructions.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Block Transfer&#xA;Block transfer instructions are provided such as Z80 has.&#xA;The TFM instruction requires source address and destination address &#xA;and block size as its argument.  One or two 16 bit registers (X/Y/U/S)&#xA;are used to specify source and destination addresses. Block size to be &#xA;transfered is specified by the W register. &#xA;Four style is provided:&#xA;    TFR r0+,r1+  (transfered in address is increasing order),&#xA;    TFR r0-,r1-  (transfered in address is decreasing order),&#xA;    TFR r0+,r1   (poured into the same address, I/O port for instance),&#xA;    TFR r0,r1+   (read from the same address, I/O port for instance).&#xA;I tried this instructions but I do not remember exactly.&#xA;Operand registers are pointers of source/destination addresses (,maybe).&#xA;Please try and find the behavior of these instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Multiplication And Division&#xA;The 6309 has MULD instruction which performs a 16bit x 16bit multipli-&#xA;cation. We can use various addressing modes (immediate, direct, indexed,&#xA;extend)  The result is stored in the Q register.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Division instructions are also provided.  The 6309 has two division&#xA;instructions: 16bit / 8bit, 32bit / 16bit divisions. &#xA;Various addressing modes (immediate, direct, indexed, extend) can be &#xA;used.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(Note:I forget where its result is stored.  I tried these instructions. &#xA;I remember that modulo is also computed. The quotient and the modulo &#xA;are stored D and W resp., maybe. I'm not sure, sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bit Manipulation / Bit Transfer&#xA;The 6309 provides AIM, OIM, EIM, TIM instructions which are compatible &#xA;with instructions of the Hitachi 6301 CPU.  Read the manual of the 6301&#xA;to understand thses instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instructions called BAND, BOR, BEOR, BIAND, BIOR, BIEOR, LDBT, STBT&#xA;are provided.  Behavior of thses instructions is that a logical&#xA;operation is performed for n-th bit of a data in a memory (only direct&#xA;mode is allowed) and m-th bit of a register, then the result is stored &#xA;in the register. The format of the object is :&#xA;   $11, x, (post byte), (operand).&#xA;The say that the post byte takes strange format.  I do not understand&#xA;these instructions. Sorry, please try.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To change modes ofthe 6309, we have to set the 0th bit of the MD&#xA;register.  To do this, the LDMD instruction is provided:&#xA;    LDMD #n     (where #n is a immediate n bit data)&#xA;When trap is caused, it is necessary to examine the reason of the &#xA;trap. The BITMD instruction can be used for this purpose:&#xA;    BITMD #n    (where #n is a immediate n bit data)&#xA;The contents of the MD register and #n is ANDed, and changes the CC &#xA;register (,maybe, I do not remember exactly).&#xA;Once this instruction is executed, the 6th and the 7th bit of the &#xA;MD register is CLEARED.  Therefore, we can't examine the MD register.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pushing and poping the W registers on/from stack:&#xA;    PSHSW     (Push the W register on the system stack),&#xA;    PULSW     (Pop the W register from the system stack),&#xA;    PSHUW     (Push the W register on the user stack),&#xA;    PULUW     (Pop the W register from the user stack).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="173" LastActivityDate="2016-04-21T14:29:50.037" CommentCount="0" />

Flame retardants (very common in old computers) will only speed up the yellowing process. It could be any UV light, not just the ones from the Sun. Heat made from the device itself plus some poor choices can also make your plastic a nice yellow:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The plastics used in early Super Nintendo units, however, had a terrible flame retardant mixture that yellowed as a result of the oxidation caused by the heat of the machine itself (let alone any heat in the environment).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using new formulas, the process can be slowed down, but not necessarily stopped completely.

Unfortunately it only works by removing the actual yellowed plastic...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The other method, chemical removal, relies on using bleaches to attack the yellowed molecules in the plastic and restore the color.

I'm not sure if it uses it ingame, but I consider it unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A newer game, &lt;em&gt;Nemac IV&lt;/em&gt;, presents you with a screen mode selection at the beginning, offering EHB mode as an option. It can then render its ingame 3D graphics to an EHB mode display. However, it requires a machine more powerful than a stock Amiga 500.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;HAM&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way HAM (Hold And Modify) mode works makes it unsuitable for ingame animation in most cases. I used to be unaware of any game that uses it for gameplay. (&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: There were at least 2 games using HAM for their animated action. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/a/393/92&quot;&gt;robc's answer&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fury of the Furries&lt;/em&gt; uses HAM for its still images, for example the title image and the images that are displayed before entering a new world (each consisting of a set of levels).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason why it is unfeasible to use HAM for animated action is that you will either have to tolerate so-called color bleeding to the right of pixels or you will need to employ sophisticated algorithms to counteract the color bleeding, which timing constraints may forbid or which are just not worth it to come up with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In HAM mode you usually use 6 bitplanes (you can also use it with 5 bitplanes, but there's not much point to that). That's 64 possible values per pixel. Values 0 to 15 select a full RGB color from the 16 color palette, the same way other normal screen modes would. However, value sets 16 to 31 (modify blue component), 32 to 47 (modify red component) and 48 to 63 (modify green component), respectively, each just change one of the color components relative to the color of the previous pixel. The other two color components remain unchanged from the previous pixel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say you set the color to palette entry 8 in column 100. Say also that this palette entry is $0333, i. e. a very dark gray. So the pixel in column 100 will appear gray.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, lacking a matching color in the palette, you modify the red component in column 101 to $6 (using a pixel value of $26 = 38). The resulting pixel in column 101 will now have a color equivalent to $0633, which is a dark unsaturated red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, again lacking a matching color in the palette, you modify the green component in column 102 to $7 (using a pixel value of $37 = 55). The resulting pixel in column 102 will now have a color equivalent to $0673, which is a brown-greenish color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, lacking a matching color in the palette once more, you modify the blue component in column 103 to $6 (using a pixel value of $16 = 22). The resulting pixel in column 103 will now have a color equivalent to $0676, which is a dark gray with a very slight shimmer of green.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/xGlsK.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/xGlsK.png&quot; alt=&quot;HAM pixels before blitting&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;note that each differently colored square represents 1 pixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far so good, but say you now want to blit an animated character onto the bitmap. Say the rightmost pixel of that character ends up in column 100 and it is a bright white, palette value $0FFF. What this means is that the white will bleed into the next 2 pixels:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to modifying just the red component, the visible color in column 101 will be $06FF, a bright cyan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to modifying just the green component, the visible color in column 102 will be $067F, a bright blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only in column 103 will you have modified all three color components and the apparent pixel color will be the same $0676 as the original one before blitting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/OTbAq.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/OTbAq.png&quot; alt=&quot;HAM pixels after blitting&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;note that each differently colored square represents 1 pixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on how many and which color components you consecutively modify, the color bleeding can affect more or less pixels and depending on how different the colors are to the originally intended colors, the artifacts can be more or less visible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/XzthK.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/XzthK.gif&quot; alt=&quot;uncorrected HAM color bleeding when naively blitting&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; &lt;em&gt;note that I scaled the image by a factor of 2 to make the artifacts easier to see&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To counteract the bleeding, you would have to design a routine that figures out which pixels to the right of a blit to adjust and which pixel values are the optimal ones that let the apparent pixel colors match the original ones as closely as possible.

This lets you do things like access a directory on your Mac or PC directly from the Atari, and even configure printers so that you can print from your Atari! I haven't actually tried this device myself, but many people swear by it. There are a variety of options to choose from at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atarimax.com/sio2pc/documentation/index.html&quot;&gt;http://www.atarimax.com/sio2pc/documentation/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The option that I'm using is SIO2SD, which is basically an SD-card adaptor for the Atari. You just plug this into your Atari, and it sort of pretends to be a disk drive. The Atari boots up into a sort of disk image picker program installed on the SD card, and from there you can pick any of the disk images you put on there to boot from. You can also do things like create empty disk images that you can use from the Atari as if they were actual disks. That way you can do the things you're talking about, using BASIC or anything else and saving your work on these &quot;disks&quot;. This device works well for me since I am using my Atari solely for gaming, set up in the living room connected to a big new TV (living the dream!).

Just dropping it in the same directory is not&#xA;  sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://basilisk.cebix.net/README&quot;&gt;BASILISK II readme&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;rom&lt;/code&gt; preference is defined&#xA;  below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;rom &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;p&gt;This item specifies the file name of the Mac ROM file to be used by &#xA;    Basilisk II.

Again from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://basilisk.cebix.net/README&quot;&gt;BASILISK II readme&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;disk&lt;/code&gt; preference is&#xA;  defined: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;disk &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;p&gt;This item describes one MacOS volume to be mounted by Basilisk II.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;    There can be multiple &quot;disk&quot; lines in the preferences file.

The &quot;volume   description&quot; is either the pathname of a&#xA;    hardfile or a platform-dependant   description of an HFS partition or&#xA;    drive. If the volume description is   prefixed by an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;),&#xA;    the volume is write protected for MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;p&gt;Basilisk II can also handle some types of Mac &quot;disk image&quot; files&#xA;    directly,   as long as they are uncompressed and unencoded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;p&gt;BeOS:&#xA;        To specify an HFS partition, simply specify its path (e.g.&#xA;        &quot;/dev/disk/scsi/0/1/0/0_3&quot;).

Under Linux, if you&#xA;        don't specify any volumes, Basilisk II will search /etc/fstab for&#xA;        unmounted HFS partitions and use these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;p&gt;AmigaOS:&#xA;        Partitions/drives are specified in the following format:&#xA;          /dev//////&#xA;        &quot;start block&quot; and &quot;size&quot; are given in blocks, &quot;block size&quot; is given in&#xA;        bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows:&#xA;        To define a logical volume (Windows NT only), specify its path (e.g. &quot;c:\&quot;).&#xA;        To define a physical volume (NT and 9x), additionally give the &quot;physical&quot;&#xA;        keyword (E.g. &quot;physical c:\&quot;).

It's just a dump of the screen memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first 6144 bytes store the screen bitmap: 256x192 pixels, 1 bit per pixel (opn or off). The layout is not linear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The screen bitmap is divided horizontally into three thirds: each one is 2048 bytes and store 8 text rows of 32 column each one (each character cell has 8 scans of 8 pixels each one).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For each third, the first scan of each character cell is stored, left to right, top to bottom. Then, the second scan, then the third, until the last one, the eighth. After this, a new third is stored in the same fashion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Each byte stored has 8 pixels: the MSb belongs to the leftmost pixel as shown on the screen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following the bitmap region, the remaining 768 bytes store the attributes. There is 1 byte of attribute for each character cell. Stored left to right, top to bottom. Bits 2-0 store the foreground colour, or &quot;ink&quot; colour (colour assigned to &quot;on&quot; pixels). Bits 5-3 store the background colour or &quot;paper&quot; colour (colour assigned to &quot;off&quot; pixels). Bit 6 is bright. If setted, both paper and ink colours are lighter. Bit 7 is flash. If setted, the paper and ink colour swap every 640 ms to give a kind of flashing character.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To have a clue of how bitmap and attribute are stored, you can type this little BASIC program that will shows you the arrangement of pixels on the screen, by dumping part of the ROM to the screen (which will show up as random pixels and colours):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;10 FOR n=0 TO 6911: POKE 16384+n,PEEK n: NEXT n&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A similar program gives this result:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/IMijd.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/IMijd.gif&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For each paper or ink colour, the arrangement of the three bits encode a RGB value in this order: G R B. So, colour 6 (binary 110) is green + red = yellow. The complete table is this:&#xA;0: black, 1: blue, 2: red, 3:magenta, 4: green, 5:cyan, 6:yellow, 7: white&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With bright setted, all these colours except black are intensified. This gives a total of 15 different colours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Timex 2048/2068 computers add two more screen modes, called HiColour and HiRes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;HiColour mode is entered by setting bit 1 of port $FF. It differs a little from the standard mode, explained above. HiColour mode uses an attribute region which is not 768 bytes, but 6144 bytes in size, the same as the bitmap region. The attribute region does not start following the bitmap region, but there is a gap of 1280 bytes between the end of the bitmap and the start of the attribute region. The total screen size is 12288 bytes, not including this gap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The layout of this attribute region is the same as the bitmap region (3 thirds, the first scan is stored, then the second, etc). There is now 1 byte of atribute for each scan of 8 pixels. The format of the attribute byte is the same as in the standard mode.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On tape, some programs use two different blocks to load the bitmap region, then the attribute region (as they are not contiguous). Some others use a single block containing both regions along with 1280 byte gap between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following program will show you the arrangement in this mode. It won't work on a regular Sinclair Spectrum, but in a Timex TC2048/2068.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;10 OUT 255,2: FOR n=0 TO 6143: POKE 16384+n,PEEK n:POKE 24576+n,PEEK n: NEXT n&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;HiRes is entered by setting bit 3 of port $FF. This mode shows a screen of 512x192 pixels, using two different bitmap regions. One region is the same as in the standard and HiColour mode, and the second one is located in the same place as the attribute region of the HiColour mode.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For each scan of 16 pixels, the left most 8 pixels are stored in the first bitmap region, and the rightmost 8 pixels are stored in the second bitmap region.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each bitmap region is arranged the same way as the other screen modes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The foreground, background and border colour is setted separately on bits 5-3 of port $FF. These three bits store the ink colour which will be applied to all &quot;on&quot; pixels. The 1-complement of this value will be used for both paper and border colours. In HiRes mode, the bright bit is always setted and there is no flash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following program will show you how the HiRes mode is arranged:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;10 OUT 255,4: FOR n=0 TO 6143: POKE 16384+n,PEEK n:POKE 24576+n,PEEK n: NEXT n&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On tape, HiRes SCREEN$ are stored the same way as HiColour SCREEN$.

Unfortunately, the SHR screen's memory in bank $E1 is located in &quot;slow RAM&quot; — that is, memory controlled by the Mega II chip which emulates 1 MHz 8-bit Apple IIs. Access to this memory is gated to that 1 MHz speed instead of the 2.8 MHz of the rest of memory. This has plagued Apple IIgs graphics developers since the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a number of hardware quirks of the Apple IIgs can be used in tandem to help ease the pain:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadowing allows bank $01 to be shadowed into bank $E1; that means that whatever is written into bank $01 is automatically mirrored into bank $E1 without slowing you down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use the main/auxmem toggle softswitches ($C003 and $C005) to use bank $01 instead of bank $00 for the direct page and stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stack and direct page can both be moved around within the bank they're located in by changing the values of the stack pointer and direct register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's see how this works!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Shadowing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You probably know that the Apple IIgs has a single super high-resolution graphics buffer, located in bank $E1 from $2000-$9FFF. This SHR buffer consists of the pixel data, a set of scanline control bytes (SCBs) which describe the mode of each row of pixels (including which palette to use and whether they're using 320 or 640 mode), and 16 palettes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That memory is slow. It's designed to support the 8-bit emulation of the Mega II chip, so writes into it are slowed down to 1 MHz whether you like it or not. There is a workaround, however. The clever people that designed the Apple IIgs included a technology called &lt;strong&gt;shadowing&lt;/strong&gt;; this is the ability to have the hardware mirror writes to bank $01 into bank $E1. The writes into bank $01 execute at the computer's regular 2.8 MHz speed, which is obviously much better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shadowing of SHR memory in bank $01 into bank $E1 is controlled by bit 3 in the &lt;code&gt;SHADOW&lt;/code&gt; softswitch at $E0/C035. When 0, shadowing is enabled. When 1, it's disabled. Other bits in that softswitch control other aspects of shadowing, so be sure not to change those by mistake (use a read/modify/write operation sequence).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the first step is to allocate the bank $01 SHR buffer. It has to be located at $01/2000-$01/9FFF or it won't work, for obvious reasons — shadowing mirrors writes to the same address in bank $E1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you own the bank $01 SHR buffer! Either use &lt;code&gt;NewHandle&lt;/code&gt; to allocate it (be sure to set the flag that allows it to allocate special memory, since all of bank $01 is special) or, for GS/OS applications, set the auxtype bit which tells GS/OS to use shadowing so that GS/OS allocates it for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bytes already located in the bank $01 SHR buffer, however, do not get copied over automatically. You have to write any bytes you want to be copied after shadowing is turned on. That means you either need to track exactly what's changed and redraw those bytes, or redraw the all or most of the frame every refresh cycle. Which you do is up to you (and likely depends on how much you expect to change each refresh).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could of course use your typical &lt;code&gt;LDA&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;STA&lt;/code&gt; loops or similar to do the refresh, but there's a much, much faster way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Stacking the deck: Direct page tricks&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the 6502 and 65C02, the zero page and stack are fixed in memory; the zero page is always located at $0000-$00FF, and the stack is always in $0100-$01FF. The 65816 changes all that. The direct page (previously known as the zero page) can be moved to any location in bank $00 by changing the value in the Direct register. This can be done using instructions such as &lt;code&gt;TCD&lt;/code&gt; (Transfer aCcumulator to Direct register), like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;            lda #$2000&#xA;            tcd                   ; Set the direct page to $2000&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the 65816 allows you to move the stack by expanding the stack pointer register, previously an 8-bit offset from $0100, to be a 16-bit pointer within bank $00. You use instructions such as &lt;code&gt;TCS&lt;/code&gt; (Transfer aCcumulator to Stack pointer) to move the stack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about stack and direct page operations is that you can use instructions which use fewer cycles to access them. In fact, it gets even better, as we'll see shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But how does this help us? The shadow SHR buffer is in bank $01, and the direct page and stack are trapped in bank $00. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not so fast!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Apple IIgs was designed to be able to emulate an enhanced 8-bit Apple II; that is, an Apple II with at least 128K of memory. Because 8-bit Apple IIs can't access more than 64K directly, a mechanism called bank switching allowed you to select which 64K bank of memory you wanted to use by swapping them into the same 64K address space. This was done by using softswitches to toggle between main and &quot;auxiliary&quot; memory, often called &quot;auxmem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a set of softswitches for selecting whether you wish to read from auxmem or main memory, and write to auxmem or main memory:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$E0C002     equ RDMAINRAM         ; Read from main memory&#xA;$E0C003     equ RDCARDRAM         ; Read from auxiliary memory&#xA;$E0C004     equ WRMAINRAM         ; Write to main memory&#xA;$E0C005     equ WRCARDRAM         ; Write to auxiliary memory&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Apple IIgs emulates this mechanism by using bank $00 as main memory and bank $01 as auxmem; writing to &lt;code&gt;RDCARDRAM&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WRCARDRAM&lt;/code&gt; causes bank $01 to take bank $00's place, so that any accesses to bank $00 actually access bank $01.  Now things get interesting: by selecting auxiliary memory in this way, accesses to the stack and direct page actually access bank $01, which is where our SHR buffer is!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we have a way to use higher-performance direct page and stack instructions to read and write the SHR buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we need to figure out the best way to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Putting it together&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to do is turn off shadowing. You don't want writes to the SHR buffer in bank $01 to be duplicated to bank $E1 until you're ready.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          sep #$20&#xA;          lda &amp;gt;SHADOW             ; Get the current shadow register&#xA;          ora #$08                ; Turn on the &quot;stop SHR shadowing&quot; bit&#xA;          sta &amp;gt;SHADOW             ; Save the updated value&#xA;          rep #$20&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This code ensures shadowing is disabled while not changing the values of any of the other bits in the &lt;code&gt;SHADOW&lt;/code&gt; register (there are bits for controlling shadowing of various parts of bank $00; all we care about is the SHR buffer, though).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you should draw your graphics into the SHR buffer in bank $01, starting at $2000. You can either redraw the whole thing or, preferably, update just the areas that need to change. This doesn't affect what's on the screen, so it can be done in pieces or in strange ways that would look weird if immediately reflected on the screen. However you like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the point where you decide when it's time to update the display. Maybe you do it immediately every time a screen update routine finishes running. Maybe you wait until the vertical scan has passed the first scan line you plan to refresh. Either way, the process is roughly the same. Wolfenstein 3D just draws, without worrying about the vertical scan, because it cares more about speed than about possible tearing effects caused by vertical refresh collisions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the time comes to refresh the display, the first step is to turn shadowing back on so that writes to the bank $01 SHR buffer are mirrored to bank $E1:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          sep #$20&#xA;          lda &amp;gt;SHADOW             ; Get the current shadow register&#xA;          and #$F7                ; Turn off the &quot;stop SHR shadowing&quot; bit&#xA;          sta &amp;gt;SHADOW             ; Save the updated value&#xA;          rep #$20&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now shadowing of the SHR buffer has been enabled. Our job now is to take the contents of the bank $01 buffer — at least the parts of it which have changed — and draw them right on top of themselves to update the bank $E1 buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think about it for a moment. The contents of the bank $01 buffer are only shadowed to bank $E1 when changed, but it contains the image we want to display already. So we just need to read the changed data and write it right back on top of itself to mirror it to the displayed screen. It sounds a little crazy, but only until you think about it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since we're going to be fiddling with the stack and direct registers, we need to save those so we can restore them later. We also need to disable interrupts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          sei                     ; Disable interrupts&#xA;          tdc                     ; Copy direct register to accumulator&#xA;          sta savedDP             ; Save it locally&#xA;          tsc                     ; Copy stack pointer to accumulator&#xA;          sta savedStack          ; Save that too&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why did we disable interrupts? Because if bank $01 is occupying the space normally used by bank $00 when an interrupt fires, the interrupt handler will almost certainly blow up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine this scenario: AppleTalk is enabled, and the AppleTalk interrupt fires, causing AppleTalk code to get control of the system briefly. It restores its stack and direct page pointers so it can access the data it expects to access, but because bank $01 is now occupying the space normally taken by bank $00, it gets the wrong data (and writes over other programs' data), and things rapidly fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we complete the preparations by swapping bank $01 to replace bank $00:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          sep #$20&#xA;          sta &amp;gt;WRCARDRAM          ; Writes to bank $00 go to bank $01&#xA;          sta &amp;gt;RDCARDRAM          ; Reads from bank $00 to go bank $01&#xA;          rep #$20&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From now on, all accesses to bank $00 actually access bank $01. We're going to use stack and direct page instructions exclusively, for maximum performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's time to start drawing. We're going to draw the entire screen each frame for this example. It's what Wolf 3D does, because it's pretty typical for most or all of the screen to change, or at least enough of it that trying to update only parts of it wasn't worth the effort. But you might find ways to do better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to set the Direct register to point to $2000, the first byte of the SHR buffer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          lda #$2000&#xA;          tcd&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we can use direct page instructions (which typically use one cycle less than their absolute equivalents) to access the first page (256 bytes) of the buffer. That alone sounds like a win, and it is, but we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to point the stack pointer at $20FF, which is the last byte in the first page of the SHR buffer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          clc&#xA;          adc #$00FF&#xA;          tcs&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This takes the $2000 already in the accumulator, adds $FF, and stores the result ($20FF) into the stack pointer. We calculate the value because we'll be looping back up here later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to copy a page of screen data on top of itself, so that that page of data is shadowed to the main SHR buffer in bank $E1. By default, you think that you'll need a loop of reading a word, then writing a word, over and over. But it turns out that with our direct page and stack configured the way we have them, there's a way to combine reading and writing into a single instruction!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PEI&lt;/code&gt; (Push Effective Indirect) instruction isn't used as often as it should be. It fetches a word from the direct page and pushes it onto the stack in one smooth operation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So consider this: our stack now starts at $20FF and works backward toward $2000 with each push. The direct page starts at $2000 and extends up to $20FF. That means they overlap, occupying exactly the same memory. So &lt;code&gt;PEI&lt;/code&gt; can be used to copy a value on top of itself in this space, if we use it just right. Here's how:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          pei $FE&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one instruction takes the value located at offset $FE on the direct page (that is, at $01/20FE-20FF) and pushes it onto the stack. Since the stack pointer is at $20FF, the result is that the value is written on top of itself, using a two-byte, 6-cycle operation to refresh two bytes of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So all we need to do to copy the entire page over is to have a series of 128 &lt;code&gt;PEI&lt;/code&gt;s in a row. We do this instead of using a loop because a loop just adds overhead, and every cycle counts when you're doing this — especially since interrupts are disabled, and we can only leave them disabled for so long. This code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          pei $FE&#xA;          pei $FC&#xA;          pei $FA&#xA;          pei $F8&#xA;          ...&#xA;          pei $06&#xA;          pei $04&#xA;          pei $02&#xA;          pei $00&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you've finished copying the page, update the Direct register and Stack pointer (to $2100 and $21FF) and do it over and over, adding $0100 to each register every time a page finishes copying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two tricks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick 1: Periodically enable interrupts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, you need to periodically switch bank $00 back into place and re-enable interrupts so that MIDISynth, GS/OS, and other users of interrupts have an opportunity to be serviced. The operating system cannot keep functioning properly if you don't allow it to periodically handle interrupts, and music and sound effects will not play correctly if their interrupts aren't processed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, AppleTalk networks will be disconnected if interrupts are disabled for more than 104.167µsec — another reason to be careful with how long you leave interrupts disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wolfenstein 3D re-enables interrupts after every seventh page is copied), like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          sep #$20&#xA;          sta &amp;gt;RDMAINRAM          ; Read from bank $00&#xA;          sta &amp;gt;WRMAINRAM          ; Write to bank $00&#xA;          rep #$20&#xA;          lda entryStack          ; Retrieve the original stack pointer&#xA;          tcs                     ; Then restore the stack to there&#xA;          lda entryDP             ; Then do the same thing for the direct page&#xA;          tcd&#xA;          cli                     ; Enable interrupts&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As soon as that &lt;code&gt;CLI&lt;/code&gt; (CLear Interrupt disable) instruction is executed, any pending interrupts are processed before our code continues to execute. That means we can immediately disable interrupts again and restore our work environment to continue to copy the screen:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          sei                     ; Disable interrupts&#xA;          sep #$20&#xA;          sta &amp;gt;RDCARDRAM          ; Read from bank $01&#xA;          sta &amp;gt;WRCARDRAM          ; Write to bank $01&#xA;          rep #$20&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now all you have to do is restore the stack and direct page to where you left off and pick up where you left off. Keep going until you reach $9D00 (or $A000 if you need to update the palettes and SCBs). You can of course also stop sooner if you only need to update certain rows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick 2: Insert NOPs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to the intricacies of how the 65816's cycle timing works, you can actually improve the performance of your PEI-slamming code by inserting a &lt;code&gt;NOP&lt;/code&gt; instruction after each 8th &lt;code&gt;PEI&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;em&gt;There are some sources that say to put it after every 13th &lt;code&gt;PEI&lt;/code&gt;. It's unclear which is correct; Wolfenstein 3D does it every 8th one, however.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This technique takes some getting used to, and has a lot of ways you can mess it up (by failing to toggle a softswitch at the right point, usually, or by imbalance between the stack and direct page locations you're using). But once you get it down, it's among the fastest, if not the very fastest, ways to blit to the Apple IIgs screen using a back buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="72" LastEditorUserId="72" LastEditDate="2016-05-04T03:02:02.383" LastActivityDate="2016-05-04T03:02:02.383" CommentCount="2" />

This results in a big performance improvement in programs that do a lot of function calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: The compiler doesn't do any memory switching during the compile process. This means that you run out of memory quickly when developing complex programs. This forces the developer to split the program in smaller units and compile/link per parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: MSX-C only understands K&amp;amp;R C. SDCC and Hitech-C support more modern dialects of C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: MSX-C runs natively on the MSX. There's no need to waste time compiling under Linux/Windows and moving the binary to the MSX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, just writing a compiler for MSX able to use the memory mapper would be a huge improvement. Running out of memory is the biggest annoyance I've found so far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="234" LastActivityDate="2016-04-23T09:22:02.327" CommentCount="7" />

The other reason is that on those filesystems file data always occupies a multiple of some unit (a block on Amiga OFS/FFS and a cluster - consisting of multiple blocks - on MS-DOS FAT12) and if the file size doesn't exactly equal that multiple, some bytes of the last block or cluster are wasted where no useful data is stored.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are right that the Amiga OFS format also stores housekeeping information on each data block (a block that is used for the contents of the file, as opposed to a block that is used for the file metadata or directory data), so only 488 bytes of each 512 byte block can be used for actual file data, while the Amiga FFS (Fast Filesystem) format uses all 512 bytes of a data block for file data and doesn't store redundant housekeeping information there, that's why you can in general put some more data onto FFS disks than on OFS disks (unless no file on the disk is larger than 488 bytes or your disk content consists only of directories and subdirectories, in which case you can store the same amount).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The speed difference when reading a directory likely comes from the vastly different way each filesystem (Amiga OFS/FFS vs. MS-DOS FAT12) stores directory information on the disk:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MS-DOS FAT12 groups several file metadata structures (that include filename, protection bits, change date, first cluster, etc.) into one block while Amiga OFS/FFS has one file metadata block per file (OFS/FFS directory blocks just store a pointer to the first file metadata block and a hash table for quickly finding a file/subdirectory if you access it directly by filename).

The whole concept of &quot;Home computer standard&quot; was a new thing to game coders, so they usually completely ignored the MSX standard definitions because on specific parts of the world there were only a few different MSX1 machines for sale.

This also applies to believing that some resources couldn't ever be present on a specific slot (ram on slot 0-x, for example).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Directly accessing I/O ports, as this isn't allowed by the standard, or by doing hardcoded VDP I/O access. This causes problem on upgrades or allowed hardware variations, like the MSX2 upgrade cartridges. It also causes the program to fail to use alternate implementations of a given extension, like the RS-232 or the MSX-Music. It's a known troublemaker for games that do direct I/O on the MemoryMapper ports, making them incompatible with MSX-DOS2. On some machines, it's known to cause problems with certain joysticks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Directly jumping into the BIOS routines, instead of using the default jump-table interface.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Incorrect CALLs for the SubROM on MSX&gt;=2 machines. It's difficult to call the SubROM from DOS, and programmers tried unofficial tricks that cause problems on many machines.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Assumption that the CPU would ever have 3.57MHz. This causes problems on turbo machines, which run such games too fast.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Assumption that the amount of free memory on BASIC would always be a given amount (like 28815 or 24972 bytes). But floppy-equipped models had less free RAM. This is often solved by holding [CTRL] key pressed while booting the MSX. That way only 1 drive is initialized, which frees up some memory. If that is not enough (like the case with many cassette games) the whole disk drive needs to be disabled. This can be done by holding [SHIFT] key pressed while booting the MSX.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Ignoring MSX-DOS or MSX-Disk BIOS coding guidelines and assuming that only MSX-DOS1 would ever be possible.

In cassette boot mode, the operating system reads a record from the tape recorder and loads the following information:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;byte 2 gives the number of records to load (up to 256 records, each containing 128 bytes, so 32 KB in theory)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bytes 3 and 4 give the address at which the tape must be loaded&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bytes 5 and 6 give the address of the initialisation routine which must be called once the given number of records have been loaded and the first-stage initialisation has completed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the remaining bytes contain code which is called (&lt;code&gt;JSR&lt;/code&gt;) once the given number of records have been loaded&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The operating system expects the code called at this point to return success or failure; if it indicates success, the initialisation routine pointed to by bytes 5 and 6 is called (&lt;code&gt;JSR&lt;/code&gt; again), and when that returns, control is transferred to &lt;code&gt;DOSVEC&lt;/code&gt; using a plain &lt;code&gt;JMP&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;DOSVEC&lt;/code&gt; must be set up too. Once the tape had been loaded, &lt;kbd&gt;RESET&lt;/kbd&gt; restarts the second-stage initialisation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the cassette boot protocol expects a three-stage boot in any case. Since the cassette boot loads the tape linearly, it makes sense to use a tape-specific boot loader: the vast majority of programs would have a non-linear memory layout, so dumping all of memory to tape would just result in even longer load times than strictly necessary. Having a boot program allows various records to be loaded from tape into the appropriate location, and it allows &lt;kbd&gt;RESET&lt;/kbd&gt; to be handled without reloading everything from tape. Obviously for anything larger than 32 KB it's required anyway...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="79" LastActivityDate="2016-04-25T08:43:22.540" CommentCount="0" />

Any time access happens within the MEGA II's domain, the system has to slow to 1 MHz. That's why shadowing and such is such a big win for graphics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there are two main data buses in the Apple IIgs (ignoring the slot I/O bus, which doesn't matter for this context): the MEGA II data bus, which operates at 1 MHz to support 8-bit emulation (and the bank $E0 and $E1 memory space), and the FPI (Fast Processor Interface) bus, which handles the 16-bit realm and all the rest of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two sides of the system operate largely independently; in fact, they even have their own memory refresh cycles for the areas of memory they're responsible for (the FPI side's refresh cycle causes an 8% loss of performance, which is why you often hear a 2.6 MHz speed for the IIgs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of that independence, there's a need to synchronize between the two sides whenever data is transferred from one side to the other. Synchronization performs by the FPI basically stopping the FPI side's clock (thereby halting execution) and waiting until the MEGA II is in the right part of its cycle, then it starts running again, but synchronized to the MEGA II clock (and therefore temporarily running at 1 MHz for the duration of the operation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I presume that adding the &lt;code&gt;NOP&lt;/code&gt; at appropriate intervals reduces the length of time spent waiting for synchronization to occur.

The rest of the program is therefore loaded from address &lt;code&gt;16384&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;58623&lt;/code&gt;, making a total length of &lt;code&gt;42240&lt;/code&gt; bytes. The screen will surely show garbage during the load process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The copier is still safe beginning at address &lt;code&gt;64000&lt;/code&gt;. It will craft a header block of type &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; (Bytes), a file name, start address of &lt;code&gt;23296&lt;/code&gt; and length according to the number of bytes actually copied (worst case it's &lt;code&gt;42240&lt;/code&gt; bytes). It will save the header, then the block just loaded beginning from &lt;code&gt;16384&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To recover the original screen content (which might have code hidden in it, or used by the initialization routines to check for integrity as a copy countermeasure), the copier would ask the user to load the big block for a second time, but this time the loader would load only &lt;code&gt;6912&lt;/code&gt; bytes to address &lt;code&gt;16384&lt;/code&gt;, discarding the rest of the big block. The copier then, would make another header for the screen file, saving it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end we end up with two blocks: the first one is a big block of &lt;code&gt;42240&lt;/code&gt; bytes that will start at &lt;code&gt;23296&lt;/code&gt;, and the second one, smaller, containing the screen, that will start at &lt;code&gt;16384&lt;/code&gt; with the standard length for a screen of &lt;code&gt;6912&lt;/code&gt; bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using a copier or by other means, the user would swap the blocks in tape so the screen block comes first, then the big block. A BASIC loader for the whole program would be something like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;10 POKE 23729,111: LOAD &quot;&quot;SCREEN$: LOAD &quot;&quot;CODE&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;POKE&lt;/code&gt; command modifies the address of the output routine for the &quot;S&quot; channel to point to an address in ROM in where a &lt;code&gt;RET&lt;/code&gt; instruction is stored. The effect of this is to silent any text output to the screen, which would corrupt the screen loaded when the second block loads its header and prints the &quot;&lt;code&gt;Bytes: ....&lt;/code&gt;&quot; text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This loader assumes that the stack pointer doesn't get changed from its default value at boot, which will be case for some programs. Others may need the user to get access to the original loader to see what number the &lt;code&gt;CLEAR&lt;/code&gt; statement has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A example routine that performs the copy of the big block is now presented. It is from the spanish magazine &quot;Microhobby&quot; and belongs to a series of articles collectively called &quot;The Bible of the Hacker&quot;. The routine is featured in the XIV issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As presented here, the routine is meant to be used from plain &lt;code&gt;BASIC&lt;/code&gt;. It uses the &lt;code&gt;DEF FN&lt;/code&gt; method so one can run the routine with an argument, in this case, the flag needed for the big block. So, to use the routine you would set up a small &lt;code&gt;BASIC&lt;/code&gt; program as this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;10 DEF FN A(N) = USR 64000&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, assuming the flag is &lt;code&gt;255&lt;/code&gt;, you would start the routine by typing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RANDOMIZE FN A(255)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/yj8vF.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/yj8vF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Link to the scanned article (spanish): &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://microhobby.speccy.cz/mhf/088/MH088_21.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://microhobby.speccy.cz/mhf/088/MH088_21.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="105" LastActivityDate="2016-04-26T07:41:12.873" CommentCount="0" />

The general formula is &lt;code&gt;poke -1,((peek(-1)xor&amp;amp;hff)and&amp;amp;hf0)*1.0625&lt;/code&gt;. This is copying the high nibble of the secondary slot selection register into the low nibble. And why is this necessary? Sit down and relax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Slots in MSX1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original 1983 specification of the MSX system allowed for four memory slots, each divided in 4x16K pages. You can switch any page of any slot into the page with the same number (same addresses range) of the Z80, thus making the slot contents visible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A MSX boots (let's ignore cartridge games and the disk system for now) in MSX-BASIC with the following slots configuration: BIOS ROM in page 0, BASIC interpreter in page 1, RAM in pages 2 and 3. Assuming a 64K RAM computer, a game that wants to use more RAM than the upper 32K must switch the RAM slot in page 0 and/or PAGE 1. The usual procedure for this (which works in &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; all the machines) is: check the slot switched in page 3, then switch the same slot in page 0/1. And, hey, it worked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Slots in MSX2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Life was good for those cassette games but then the MSX2 standard appeared in 1985. Amongst other improvements, it introduced the concept of &lt;em&gt;expanded slots&lt;/em&gt;. This means that one or more of the four primary slots can be expanded, meaning that the slot actually consists of four &lt;em&gt;subslots&lt;/em&gt;. So in that case you no longer have e.g. slot 3, but slots 3-0, 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How does that work? To switch a expanded slot, let's say 3-2 in page 1, you first switch primary slot 3 in page 3. Then you write a value in the &lt;em&gt;secondary slot selection register&lt;/em&gt; for this slot, which is located at its address FFFFh. This register contains four two-bit fields, each indicating the secondary slot number that is visible at each page &lt;em&gt;when the slot is switched to that page&lt;/em&gt;. Whoa. So in our case the value would be &lt;code&gt;xxxx10xx&lt;/code&gt; (xx = the previous value).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now let's say we are loading a game from a cassette tape in our shiny MSX2 computer. The game does the &quot;let's check the page 3 slot and switch it in page 1&quot; trick to get more RAM visible. But that does not work. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MSX2 computers have usually slot 3 expanded, and RAM is in one of these subslots. Let's say it's in 3-2 in our case. So the game sees that slot 3 is on page 3, so it switches it on page 1... but &lt;strong&gt;what secondary slot is visible&lt;/strong&gt;? Answer: we don't know, it could be anything! Chances are that it is not subslot 2 as we expect, so no RAM is actually visible and... booom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;magical poke&quot; solves this by making sure that the values of the secondary slot selection register of the RAM slot for pages 0 and 1 are the same as for pages 2 and 3 (which are usually the same). You can poke directly from BASIC because the RAM slot is already visible in page 3 (-1 = &amp;amp;HFFFF in BASIC), then the non-expended-slots-aware game can happily switch just the primary slot, and tada!

Similarly the Bell 103 had a signalling rate of 300 baud with FSK giving us 300 bps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;110 and 300 baud were chosen at the time primarily because both modems were intended to be used over copper wire and &quot;unconditioned&quot; telephone lines, with at least one part of the connection going through an acoustic coupler. The worst-case for acoustic couplers talking to carbon microphones is somewhere around 300 baud.

Most shells have two modes of operation, interactive mode where they manage the command line and execute commands entered interactively, and batch mode where they run scripts. They're &quot;standard&quot; programs which handle whatever the input and output system is, and provide their features with no extra special sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In DOS, the &quot;kernel&quot; is provided by two files, typically &lt;code&gt;IO.SYS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MSDOS.SYS&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;IBMBIO.COM&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IBMDOS.COM&lt;/code&gt;). These are loaded at boot-up; they read &lt;code&gt;CONFIG.SYS&lt;/code&gt; for configuration, and once all the device drivers have loaded and initialised, they load the shell and start running it. By default the shell is &lt;code&gt;COMMAND.COM&lt;/code&gt; on the boot disk, but this can be overridden by the &lt;code&gt;SHELL&lt;/code&gt; directive in &lt;code&gt;CONFIG.SYS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In theory you'd expect the IO and DOS portions of the kernel to provide the &quot;real&quot; operating system, and then COMMAND.COM to follow the standard model of shell design on top of that, but in DOS the distinction between the three parts of the core operating system aren't as well delineated as you might hope. Because of the way DOS works, with no protection between processes, and using fairly well-documented (or reverse-engineered) functions via the 0x21 interrupt, operating system functions could be implemented in various places, and extended by any number of programs, so the &quot;kernel&quot;, command interpreter and extension TSRs ended up constituting a closely-tied ecosystem... Over the course of its history, DOS ended up relying on COMMAND.COM for certain features, and some of the features DOS provided to COMMAND.COM ended up being extended in ways users expected to find; replacement DOS shells had to provide the former, and ideally respect the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some examples will hopefully help understand the kinds of issues involved better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;COMMAND.COM uses a DOS function, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-2563.htm&quot;&gt;0x210A (&quot;Buffered Keyboard Input&quot;)&lt;/a&gt;, to read command lines; as standard this provides basic command-line editing capabilities (move the cursor around, insert/delete handling, and &lt;kbd&gt;F3&lt;/kbd&gt; command recall), but many TSRs were available to extend this: CMDEDIT, DOS 5's own DOSKEY... As an added subtlety, starting with DOS 3.3, function 0x210A indirectly checked the passage of time to handle midnight — imagine you left a DOS computer sitting at the command prompt overnight; whose job is it to notice that the date has to change? Obviously it's the operating system's responsibility, but in single-tasking DOS this required the co-operation of whatever software was running. DOSKEY hooked 0x210A to provide its enhanced command-line handling (adding history), and re-implemented most of the time-related features — but it does not handle midnight, so a DOS 5 computer running DOSKEY can lose a day if it's sitting at the command prompt at midnight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;COMMAND.COM allows other programs to run its internal commands (in DOS, even commands such as &lt;code&gt;DIR&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt; are implemented in the command processor); replacement shells ideally need to implement this too. Some third-party programs used this to add new internal commands to DOS, so replacement shells not only need to expose their internal commands in the same way as COMMAND.COM (I can't remember the details off-hand), they should really support the same extension hooks too.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;COMMAND.COM splits itself into multiple sections: one (small part) for the primary shell, which is always resident (and accessed via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-4896.htm&quot;&gt;function 0x2F55&lt;/a&gt;), one containing initialisation code, and finally the so-called transient part which implements most of the functionality. The transient part isn't needed during execution of other programs, so to provide more memory for applications, it is designed so that it can remain in memory opportunistically without using any allocated memory. The way this works is that it is relocated to the top of memory (with hooks so the other parts of COMMAND.COM can find it), with some sort of signature. Programs which run without using much memory won't overwrite any of this, and when COMMAND.COM regains control, it checks its transient portion and can then just reuse it without reloading anything. Programs which use enough memory will overwrite the transient portion; when COMMAND.COM regains control, it notices this and reloads its transient portion from disk (which may involve swapping floppies; the &lt;code&gt;COMSPEC&lt;/code&gt; variable was used to point COMMAND.COM to the right file).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of this was documented at the time, and what wasn't was quickly discovered. Nowadays you can read the source code for FreeCOM or 4DOS if you're curious to see exactly how a DOS shell works...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="79" LastEditorUserId="79" LastEditDate="2016-04-27T07:10:29.863" LastActivityDate="2016-04-27T07:10:29.863" CommentCount="1" />

(If trying to play a 16bit waveform, the lowest two bits would be discarded.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this would then require additional real-time mixing of waveforms by the CPU to play more than two independent logical &quot;channels&quot;, as opposed to much typical Amiga music using 4 physical channels and no real-time mixing - for example one channel for instrument, one for accompaniment with pre-mixed chords, one for bass and one for percussion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would also require mixing or at least scaling for volume changes on a 14bit &quot;channel&quot;, as the volume levels would be locked in to allow 14bit resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The A1200 had the 14MHz Motorola 68020 - at a sampling frequency of 28kHz, that would give ~500 clock cycles for each sampling point or ~1000 for 14KHz playback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 7MHz 68000 A1000, A500 and A600 models would have half that number of clock cycles for each sampling point, so ~250 for 28KHz and ~500 for 14KHz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That gives scope for mixing, however, I only remember a simple 14bit playback program, which could handle PC Fasttracker formats and a composing program called DeliTracker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the problems was that it would be difficult to do the normal pitch control by playing back waveforms with different sampling frequencies, as these would have to be interpolated into the mixing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, to play a waveform that needs 25KHz for a particular note and another waveform (or the same) that needs 9KHz for another (in that case lower) note, you would ideally mix at a much higher frequency, but if you are limited to 28KHz, you have to &quot;force&quot; the other waveforms to fit your sampling period the best you can as these numbers are not divisible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I imagine that with the typical sampling frequencies possible with the CPUs at hand that would have resulted in a loss of quality, which might have been the main limitation.

This was a processor-intensive task which degraded&#xA;  sound quality, but was more than made up for with doubled channels.&#xA;  Oktalyzer could also be run in 4-channel mode to suit more&#xA;  processor-heavy programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which makes more sense to me that splitting each channel into two 4-bit channels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the process is quite straightforward. During the time between two VBlank interrupts (these occurs normally each 20 ms), the CPU has to take two sample buffers, mix them and write the result to a channel buffer that will be used to feed Paula.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is quite processor intensive, as for each sample in a 20 ms buffer, the CPU has to calculate what sample to fetch (depending upon the playing frequency), check if it reached the end of sample so it will start at repetition begin. With both samples gathered, each one has to be scaled according to its volume setting, then the CPU has to add them and possibly, apply some compression to avoid clipping while keeping the original dynamic range (adding both sample and then dividing into 2 would result in too quiet sound)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've just digged into the source code of an early release of Oktalyzer and found this macro: (comments of my own)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetSample:  macro&#xA;        move.b  (a0,d0.w),d4  ;get sample from buffer addressed by a0&#xA;        add.b   (a1,d1.w),d4  ;add sample from buffer addressed by a1&#xA;        eor.b   d5,d4         ;d5=-128. Fast way to add -128 to result&#xA;        move.b  d4,(a5)+      ;store result into output buffer&#xA;        swap    d0&#xA;        swap    d1&#xA;        add.l   d2,d0        ;calculate offset for next sample, buffer a0&#xA;        add.l   d3,d1        ;ditto for buffer a1&#xA;        swap    d0&#xA;        swap    d1&#xA;        endm&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which pretty does much of what I've explained (minus the volume scaling operation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this source code, I guess that initial buffers pointed by &lt;code&gt;a0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; already contain scaled samples, as there is no code in the macro to check for clipping. I also assume that these original samples are 7 bits unsigned samples. Adding them won't produce clipping, but we will end up with a 8-bit unsiged sample, which is not suitable for Paula, which expects 8-bit signed samples. To get that, we have to substract 128 from the sample value, that's to say, add -128. Adding -128 to a 8-bit number is just toggling its MSb, so d5 is preloaded with -128 and then it is XORed with the calculated sample.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="105" LastEditorUserId="105" LastEditDate="2016-04-29T09:59:22.480" LastActivityDate="2016-04-29T09:59:22.480" CommentCount="3" />

This is the flowchart taken from his web (the actual ROM code is also there)&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://laurencescotford.co.uk/?p=347&quot;&gt;http://laurencescotford.co.uk/?p=347&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/77QWh.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/77QWh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the keyboard ROM routine waits for any key to be pressed, and then, the routine waits until it has been released. Then it returns the key code that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; pressed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, according to this, if the Fx0A instruction is executed while a key has been already pressed, the instruction will wait until the key is released and then it will return the key code in register Vx.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For instructions &lt;code&gt;Ex9E&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;ExA1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Decoding and execution of these instructions begin at address &lt;code&gt;0199&lt;/code&gt; of the interpreter code. A few instructions later, a direct keyboard reading is performed, isntead of calling a ROM routine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;019A 62        OUT 2            This will take the value in VX and output it&#xA;                                to the keyboard latch. This causes external&#xA;                                flag 3 to be set if that key is currently &#xA;                                held down or reset if not&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So these instructions will react accordingly if a key was pressed before the isntruction was executed. Both will read the current state of that key the moment the Exxx instructions are executed. These two instructions don't use the ROM, so they don't interfere with any system variable that would have been modified in response to keys pressed or released.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words: if key '1' is pressed and hold, and &lt;code&gt;V1&lt;/code&gt; stores the key code for '1'...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;LD V1,1     6101   ;store key code 1 into V1&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...the following sequence of instructions will behave as this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SKP  V1     E19E   ;will skip the next instruction.&#xA;SKNP V1     E1A1   ;will not skip the next instruction.&#xA;&#xA;LD V2,K     F20A   ;will wait until the user releases the '1' key, &#xA;                   ;then it will store its keycode into &#xA;                   ;register V2.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="105" LastEditorUserId="105" LastEditDate="2016-04-30T15:40:48.537" LastActivityDate="2016-04-30T15:40:48.537" CommentCount="0" />

Very likely you either didn't notice or you forgot about those instances over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was only very vocal when you left the disk write protected or when it otherwise failed to complete its task and those are the instances that we remember the easiest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As already explained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/a/304/92&quot;&gt;nsandersen's answer&lt;/a&gt;, its task was to get an invalid block allocation bitmap back into a valid state. In order to find out which blocks are in use, it scanned through all directories, starting from the file system root, taking note of all metadata blocks (including all extension blocks) and the locations of the file data blocks and marking all those as occupied while marking all other as free. (Which also explains why it would take longer on a disk with a more complicated directory structure and on (fragmented) file systems where the metadata blocks are spread out over a far distance.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it could only finish its task if it didn't find any invalid blocks or inconsistencies during the process. If it stumbled upon an inconsistency, it would stop, report its failure and leave the disk unchanged.

  <row Id="369" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="368" CreationDate="2016-05-01T21:19:53.270" Score="13" Body="&lt;p&gt;The 6809 has a couple of instructions which provide very quick ways of pulling (popping) and pushing registers off and onto the stack, &lt;code&gt;PULS&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;PULU&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PSHS&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;PSHU&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;PSHx&lt;/code&gt; only takes 5 cycles plus one per byte, which is much faster than other methods of writing to memory. So by pointing the stack registers (&lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;) at the area of memory you want to read from and/or write to, you can quickly access memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This works particularly well for copying memory, at least in cases where the layout is amenable: read into as many registers as possible using &lt;code&gt;PULS&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PULU&lt;/code&gt; (you get to specify which registers are used, the CPU doesn't force you to push or pull all of them), and write using &lt;code&gt;PSHU&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PSHS&lt;/code&gt;. You'd set &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; to point to the memory to be read, and &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; to the address to write to, or vice versa; the pull and push instructions increment and decrement the stack registers as appropriate. The 6809 has three general-purpose 16-bit registers, &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; (also known as &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; combined), &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;, and one register that can often be spared in these kinds of loops, &lt;code&gt;DP&lt;/code&gt;; using this technique you can copy 7 bytes in 24 cycles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;; point S at the memory to be read&#xA;; point U at the target&#xA;PULS D,X,Y,DP     ; read 7 bytes into D, X, Y, DP, and increment S&#xA;PSHU D,X,Y,DP     ; write D, X, Y, DP to memory and decrement U&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This compares to the basic memory copying technique, via the &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; stack pointer, which takes 16 cycles per word (two bytes) — five cycles per load/store, and three cycles per index increment:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;; point X at the memory to be read&#xA;; point Y at the target&#xA;LDU ,X++          ; read 2 bytes into U and increment X&#xA;STU ,Y++          ; write U to memory and increment Y&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So stack blasting takes less than 4 cycles per byte, whereas &lt;code&gt;LDU&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;STU&lt;/code&gt; takes 8 cycles per byte... Furthermore, since stack blasting copies more memory per instruction pair, there's less overhead involved with loops or loop unrolling!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are of course some caveats. In particular, any interrupts which occur during this stack blast will affect the values being copied, since the interrupt will use the &quot;stack&quot; that's been set up for the copy. And since this is stack-based, reads and writes move in opposite directions... These two factors mean that stack blasting is only really useful for writing graphics to the screen: the source material can be laid out appropriately in advance, and changes caused by interrupts would only result in temporary artifacts on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tom Moertel has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-12-14-great-old-timey-game-programming-hack.html&quot;&gt;great write-up&lt;/a&gt; of this technique, including more detailed comparisons with other memory-copying techniques (offset load/stores instead of incrementing load/stores for example). He shows how he went from 157 cycles to copy 14 bytes using a typical loop, to 120 cycles with an unrolled loop, to 98 cycles with an unrolled, fixed-offset copy, down to 56 cycles using stack blasting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="79" LastEditorUserId="79" LastEditDate="2016-05-02T16:28:12.407" LastActivityDate="2016-05-02T16:28:12.407" CommentCount="3" />

And anything 33.6K and above basically demands at least one digital endpoint.  By that I mean that the modem access concentrator would connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network via data-grade T-1 or larger (see also AT&amp;amp;T T-Carrier) data trunks.  The DS-1 that rides the T-1 is channelized and the DS-0s are 64K clear channels and thus suitable for data rates up to 57.6K plus some protocol overhead and error correction.  The end user has significantly lower upload speeds because they're using analog (voice) lines.  This is also the genesis of today's asymmetric residential data model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it all comes back to baud rate.  Bit rate is a measure of the number of data bits transmitted in one second.  Baud rate is the number of times a signal in a communications channel &lt;em&gt;can change state&lt;/em&gt; in one second.  Regardless of the techniques used to encode bits in a carrier, the baud rate was always a limiting factor and was determined by the dynamic range of the signal processors available in the PSTN at the time.  110 Baud was safe.  300 Baud was pushing the limits of signal processing available in the 60s and 70s.  And from there we were able to stack new methods of line coding and framing on top of that 300 Baud to make it almost up to 64Kbps.

Any carts that require larger ROMS need to have hardware MMU's to take advantage of a bank-switching scheme. There's a seller on eBay who sells a 512k cart with a control pad, to determine which bank on the ROM the CoCo will boot to.

This is not a problem unique to emulation; CD-ROM-based installation sometimes had trouble, as did some not-quite-IBM-compatible PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to work around this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, you can make images of the disks, and mount those images in DosBox.

You can copy the files from all three floppies into a single directory somewhere (the easy way) or switch out the floppies as-needed (the harder way).

It is, however, not as fool-proof as the real non-maskable interrupt, or even as reliable as a &quot;normal&quot; but externally triggered interrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;...what they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; mean is:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's assume an unexpanded Amiga 500 as the base case. The only thing plugged in is a mouse, a monitor and a power supply. Switching off the power supply is obviously not going to save your precious drawing, and you can't do anything with the monitor, which leaves the mouse, keyboard, floppy, and the built-in ports. Unless you're MacGyver, you don't want to bend a paper clip and probe the random pins, taking these ports out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mouse and keyboard is handled by &lt;code&gt;input.device&lt;/code&gt;. You can add &lt;a href=&quot;http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Devices_Manual_guide/node00D2.html&quot;&gt;input handlers&lt;/a&gt; to have whatever code you like run when you press a key. You could add your rescue code to an input.device handler and have it trigger on an unusual key. This will, however, run as a plain old task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The floppy is normally handled by &lt;code&gt;trackdisk.device&lt;/code&gt;. You can add an &lt;a href=&quot;http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Devices_Manual_guide/node00F4.html&quot;&gt;interrupt handler&lt;/a&gt; that triggers on disk changes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The trackdisk device lets you add a software interrupt handler that will&#xA;  be Cause()'ed when a disk insert or remove occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This sounds good. &lt;code&gt;Cause()&lt;/code&gt; refers to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node033D.html&quot;&gt;exec.library/Cause()&lt;/a&gt; which will cause a &lt;em&gt;software interrupt&lt;/em&gt;. This is somewhat of a misnomer on the Amiga&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, it is really a software-initiated hardware interrupt of the lowest priority. This means that the code you add here will actually run as a genuine interrupt, interrupting any hung tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe, Not always, I don't know. Three accurate answers. Let's examine a statement from your question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...even if the system was completely &lt;em&gt;unresponsive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the system is completely frozen, but the dreaded guru has not yet shown his ugly face, there is a chance that this will indeed work. The big issue is that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; has to trigger the software interrupt! It can't trigger itself, like all the other interrupts. This &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; would be either the &lt;code&gt;trackdisk.device&lt;/code&gt; task, or another interrupt handler. This is where my knowledge fails me, because I can't see a &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; way that a disk change could do this. The three hardware interrupts available to the disk subsystem should not be able to trigger on ejecting a disk, so someone must be polling the flags manually. That means that some sort of timer subsystem and parts of exec must be in working order, almost making the trouble of interrupt pointless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1. Some platforms, for example the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800&quot;&gt;6800-series&lt;/a&gt; processor have a dedicated software interrupt which is different from a hardware interrupt.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="333" LastActivityDate="2016-05-10T12:03:29.697" CommentCount="0" />

Not sure where you are, but that's a U.S. national chain. If you have a place that sells to consumer and/or professional hair-stylists and barbers, you can find a lot of the same supplies. I found the Peroxide 40 there. I also picked up the latex gloves and a couple of smaller items that are used to mix hair coloring agents.

This is what I used to mix everything up and paint the mixture onto the IIc Plus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;From Javier's recipe:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;100 ml of liquid Peroxide 40, found in beauty supply shops&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One teaspoon of Arrowroot powder&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One teaspoon of OxyClean powder&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a picture from Javier's post. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/83I8j.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/83I8j.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture from the recipe.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I actually found Arrowroot and OxyClean at a grocery store. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mixing everything together was a bit challenging. The Oxyclean had a tendency to clump in the arrowroot but I just kept mixing until I couldn't seem to make a difference with it any longer. Probably a good five minutes, honestly. I imagine a blender could be used for this, but I didn't try it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once done, I had a flat piece of wood that I covered with aluminum foil to try to point UV at sides and things that weren't actually facing the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I dismantled the IIc Plus, removing the mainboard, the floppy, the power supply, the keyboard. This is a lot easier on a IIc Plus than what you might find on other retrocomputers but I imagine you don't want vintage electronics out in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I pushed out the multi-color Apple logo from the case and used masking tape to cover up the &quot;Apple IIc&quot; on the cover. I don't know that I really needed to cover that up, but I figured it couldn't hurt. Most recipes I've read mention that the procedure will damage the Apple logo so that's why I pushed it out. It was glued in place so it came out pretty easily and there was enough adhesive to re-stick it when I was done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the brush, I painted as smooth a coat as I could on the IIc Plus, the top and side surfaces. The mixture would foam up and every 45 minutes or so I would go back out and smooth out the covering again occasionally adding some more of the mixture. The IIc Plus is mostly large, flat pieces so I didn't have to do a lot of rotating. It was fairly challenging to cover it up well. The brush and arrowroot had a tendency to streak and I needed to keep working it until it was smooth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I did this for about four hours, maybe less. Once done, I literally took a garden hose and rinsed off the pieces. After that, I brought everything in and dried it all then left it out for an hour to so to dry further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original color was definitely brought back on the surfaces that faced the sky. The sides are still a little darker but it doesn't bother me. I think if I had something that would bend the UV to more directly to hit the sides I probably would have had a better effect there.

If you have 8KB or 16KB available you can include more of the standard BASIC features and even have room left to add your own manufacturer-specific enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many other reasons but these are among the more significant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding abstraction: it turns out to be very difficult to do unless you already know in advance what the future direction of the language will be and can plan for it.  When a language grows 'organically' (as BASIC did) you often discover too late that your initial approach wasn't the best, but for compatibility reasons you can't go back and change it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="70" LastActivityDate="2016-05-12T15:48:26.870" CommentCount="7" />

Notice how it wasn't until the DOS/Windows cycle started happening that backwards compatibility became a big thing and then sales of computer took off.

That is, when a value was written to $FF7F, it appeared at $FF9F also, and vice versa. This ghosting caused no problems with the CoCo 2, but it plays havoc with the CoCo 3, which occasionally wants to write to $FF9F when talking to its GIME chip. Similarly, any attempt at slot selection with a ghosting Multi-Pak will send spurious data to the GIME chip. Thus, the decoding of the software slot selection port had to be made more complete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Second, Tandy felt it necessary to lock out the $FF80 through $FF9F range ($FFA0 and up are already locked out by the programming of the old Multi-Pak PAL chips). This was to protect the GIME chip from conflicts with information from other external devices that might be addressed in that range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The article goes on to explain the hardware upgrades necessary to fix the Multi-Paks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the older Multi-Pak (26-3024) all that is necessary is to replace the PAL chip, U8, with updated PAL chip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the newer Multi-Pak (26-3124), Marty makes the case to have the upgrade done by a professional:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you own one of the newer MPIs (Catalog No. 26-3124), I recommend you take your MPI to Tandy and have them upgrade it for you.

It is straight forward to see that a track has = 200 ms/revolution * 1000 μs/ms / 4 μs/bit = 50,000 bits / (8 bits/byte) = 6,250 nibbles/track.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, since the &lt;em&gt;radius&lt;/em&gt; (and therefore the circumference) of the outermost and innermost track differ, shouldn't track 0 be able to hold more bits then track 39?  The circumference (C = 2 * π * r) for tracks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Track 0 = 2*π*2.625 = ~15.7&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Track 39 = 2*π*0.75 = ~4.7&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;shows track 0 has a &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; lot more &quot;space&quot; then track 39.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This naturally raises a few questions.

It is meant to load programs originally recorded at the Spectrum ROM standard speed (1500 bps). It provides a shadow ROM that pages in when the CPU starts executing a SAVE or LOAD routine. The shadow ROM mimics the behaviour of a LOAD or SAVE, but using their own routines. Many units had an after-market modification, that allowed the Sprint to be disconnected from the bus in order to improve compatibility with other peripherals, like the Interface 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't use the audio connectors (EAR/MIC), but it talks directly to the CPU through the expansion port. Therefore, the Sprint has to have electronics to clean and digitize the signal, making a volume control not neccesary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you have the disassembly of the 512 byte Sprint ROM. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zxprojects.com/images/stories/sprint/rom_sprint.html&quot;&gt;http://www.zxprojects.com/images/stories/sprint/rom_sprint.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To ease the disassembly process, I have assumed that the 512 byte block is present at address &lt;code&gt;0400h&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;05FFh&lt;/code&gt;. This is because the starting points of the original &lt;code&gt;SAVE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LOAD&lt;/code&gt; routines are at &lt;code&gt;04C2h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0556h&lt;/code&gt; respectively, so they fall entirely into this 512-byte block (as expected).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;code&gt;JP 4&lt;/code&gt; instruction right at the beginning of the ROM (after an &lt;code&gt;EI&lt;/code&gt; instruction). As this block is also at &lt;code&gt;0000h&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;JP 4&lt;/code&gt; instruction merely jumps to the next instruction, which outputs a 0 into port &lt;code&gt;BFh&lt;/code&gt;. I think this unpages the Sprint ROM, and the next instruction executed, already from the main ROM, begins at &lt;code&gt;0008h&lt;/code&gt;, the ERROR restart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way: this ROM (and thus, the device) uses these ports:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;BFh&lt;/code&gt;. Write-only. The ROM only writes 00h here. I think it's for disabling the Sprint ROM&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;7Fh&lt;/code&gt;. Write-only. The ROM writes 00h or 80h here. It's the new &quot;MIC&quot; port, bit 7.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FFh&lt;/code&gt;. Read-only. &quot;EAR&quot; port, bit 7. Decoded bit value, bit 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/lSTjH.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/lSTjH.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The internals of the Sprint seem to work according to patent number &lt;strong&gt;GB2164527A&lt;/strong&gt; or &quot;High speed cassette tape player&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The device actually decodes FSK, so the value at bit 7 of port &lt;code&gt;FFh&lt;/code&gt; is not the current state of the &quot;EAR&quot; input, as in normal loaders, but the actual bit of the current loading byte.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, as the patent states, there no need for tight loops, as the time measuring is performed by a monostable, which is reset to 0 on each positive edge of the incoming signal. The computer has to keep reading the monostable value while it waits until the next positive edge. A polarity correction circuit ensures that the edges are right regardless of the polarity the tape were recorded with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The monostable is configured so it turns to '1' after a specific period of time. Time that is roughly 3/4 times the period of a '1' bit in FSK (remember that the '1' bit lasts double the time than a '0' bit). So if a '1' is currently playing, the monostable will switch to '1' and that will be the value read by the computer, but if a '0' is playing, the next positive edge will happen long before the monostable switchs to '1', hence a '0' will be read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By analysing the source code, it is likely that port &lt;code&gt;FFh&lt;/code&gt; offers two things: the current state of the incoming signal, at bit 7, needed to track the pilot tone at the first part of the loading routine, and to detect edges in the second part. The current value of the monostable, that is, the bit after the FSK decoding process, seems to be at bit 0. The routine reads port FFh, stores bit 0 into the carry with a RRA instruction, some instructions after that, the routine retrieves the bit again into H using the instruction RL H.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ROM:0492 loc_492:&#xA;ROM:0492                 dec     l&#xA;ROM:0493                 jr      z, loc_4A8&#xA;ROM:0495                 in      a, (c)&#xA;ROM:0497                 jp      m, loc_492  &#xA;;loops while the pulse is high, so it exits &#xA;;just after a positive to negative edge has ocurred&#xA;&#xA;ROM:049A&#xA;ROM:049A loc_49A:&#xA;ROM:049A                 dec     l&#xA;ROM:049B                 jr      z, loc_4A8&#xA;ROM:049D                 rra&#xA;ROM:049E                 in      a, (c)&#xA;ROM:04A0                 jp      p, loc_49A  &#xA;;loops while the pulse is low, so it exists just after &#xA;;a negative to positive edge has ocurred.

The computer uses timming loops to detect the pilot tone, but the monostable for actual byte loading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(the following parragraphs were written after a more careful read of the new &lt;code&gt;LOAD&lt;/code&gt; routine was made)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'd like to give some details of what I think it's the very heart of the loading routine, and the code that shows all the magic that the SPRINT cassette offers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What this tape player implements is no more and no less than a converter from an asynchronous FSK coded signal to a synchronous 1-bit serial line. The &lt;code&gt;DATA&lt;/code&gt; bit is the monostable bit (bit 0 of port &lt;code&gt;FFh&lt;/code&gt;) and the &lt;code&gt;CLOCK&lt;/code&gt; bit is what we have previously called the &quot;signal&quot; bit (bit 7 of port FFh, which gives us the actual pulses present into the tape). As we stated, the conversion is performed in hardware, and &lt;code&gt;DATA&lt;/code&gt; is valid just before a negative to positive transition at &lt;code&gt;CLOCK&lt;/code&gt; happens. The byte loading routine that follows, just have to wait for this situation, taking into account that the signal flow might be interrupted at any time, so timeouts have to be provided to not to hang the computer into an endless loop because of an interrupted operation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;;Registers used:&#xA;;C = 0FFh (for the IN instruction)&#xA;;BC' = 1601h. C is xored with B at each loop. The result is &#xA;;outputted to FEh, so these two values provides visual&#xA;;and audio feedback of the loading process to the user.&#xA;;H = holds the byte that is being read from tape. First bit&#xA;;read is MSb.&#xA;;L = timeout value for waiting an edge.&#xA;&#xA;;On &quot;normal&quot; exit: H = byte loaded from tape.

A simple audio analysis shows that it isn't true, and both tracks carried the same signal. Besides, and according to Jose Leandro's research, the loader routine listened to only one pin from the joystick connector. He inferred how the inside circuit would look like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Q0j7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Q0j7.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it seems that the recording and the loader routine were made after the cable was designed, and they were in a hurry to release this collection, so they couldn't debug it enough and decided to go with a mono signal version and a more reliable, although slower loader.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More about this in Jose Leandro's hardware page:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://trastero.speccy.org/cosas/JL/CableCD/CableCD.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://trastero.speccy.org/cosas/JL/CableCD/CableCD.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And speaking of loading through the joystick port. Long time ago I tried to do something similar (although I didn't hear about the CD Games Pack until years after). My approach is to use 5 pins from the joystick port to carry a parallel 4-bit digital signal (using the direction pins), and a clock (using the trigger pin). I could even make it DDR, i.e. accepting data on both the rising and the falling edge of the clock signal. With this approach, I achieved about 155kbps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Details about this experiment can be found on my website:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zxprojects.com/index.php/external-ultra-high-loader-for-the-zx-spectrum/14-proof-of-concept-alchemist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.zxprojects.com/index.php/external-ultra-high-loader-for-the-zx-spectrum/14-proof-of-concept-alchemist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a demonstration of such technique. I use a microcontroller to store the program I want to load, along with the bit banging code that converts it into a series of nibbles to be sent over the joystick cable. The routine at the computer end merely needs to wait until a clock edge happens and then, read the data present in direction pins, store it and when the second half is read, assemble a byte and store in memory. I think the technique can be extrapolated to any computer that has a digital joystick port, and the microcontroller part can be changed for a PC with a FTDI chip with assist from software to do the bit-banging part, loading a program from USB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Sv9riKVwg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Sv9riKVwg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="105" LastEditorUserId="105" LastEditDate="2016-05-15T11:48:41.353" LastActivityDate="2016-05-15T11:48:41.353" CommentCount="1" />

DOS 3.1 was actually the first release to the public.  It had a pretty significant bug in its MASTER CREATE program, and so the patched version DOS 3.2 was released.

Simply running &lt;code&gt;INIT HELLO&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever) generated a disk that put RWTS (the DOS code itself) in exactly the position of memory it was now.  A master disk would put it as high as it could on a 16, 32, or 48k machine.  So a bug in the code that made new disks that could do that was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, DOS 3.1 and 3.2 used a 13 sector disk.  But it wasn't too much longer before Woz realized that 16 sectors was possible with a minor hardware change to the Disk II controller card.  DOS 3.3 came along with the necessary bits to fix that, and the DOS 3.3 System Master disk came with tools for moving files from 13 sector to 16 sector, and for booting the old disks from the System Master disk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ProDOS came along later and worked completely differently.  It more or less came onto the scene around the time of the Apple //e.  It clearly was developed for and on the Apple ][+, but Apple did not release it until the Apple /// was pretty much completely obviously dead.  Then suddenly here comes the //e and this new ProDOS thing.  And Apple withdrew permission at that point for A2UGs to distribute DOS 3.3 and older anymore, intending to kill off the old stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It never really did die off.  ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were other DOS releases made by Apple not explicitly referenced here.  Wikipedia's Apple DOS page (linked above) notes that bugfix versions were released for all versions of DOS, without changing the version number.  I do not doubt they did this because I have seen multiple builds of the same ProDOS version--though in the case of ProDOS, two versions may differ by as little as the build date on the splash screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were also ProntoDOS, RDOS, and a whole bunch of mods to Apple's DOS, fundamentally all patches to the DOS RWTS to change the order things were written when the disk was INIT'd.  You'll discover more about that if you dig into &quot;DOS order&quot; and &quot;ProDOS order&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were also patched versions of the RWTS to work with devices other than the Disk II such as UniDOS, which could work on a 400k 3.5&quot; disk.  The DOS RWTS could cope with a device up to 400k in size with the slightest patches, but it was only ever intended to work with the Disk II as Apple released it.  ProDOS has Disk II code included (since the Disk II is about as dumb an interface as you can get), but it also has stuff to handle a &quot;smart&quot; block device.  As far as ProDOS is concerned, all 3.5&quot; disks and hard drives are smart block devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope that's a good start for you.  If you're curious about the non-Apple DOS releases, others who know more about them can probably help you better.

In other words, just like how a floppy disk head will jump and sweep from track to track, the cassette would speed up to 80 ips to seek the tape and then drop down to 20 ips for read/write. Yes, the seek would go in either direction, though I think read/write ONLY went forwards.

Some state of the game has to be held into globals anyway. It's a just a waste of time to copy the global state into local parameters all the time. There is no advantage or gain to use high-level language structures like parameter passing to functions or subroutines.

But when you have a card larger than 6MiB (which exists as well), you're going to see a problem: The extra RAM beyond 8MB is wasted/unused.

This is a hack, as it turns out, because the limit of 8MiB of RAM is actually in the ROM.  As there are functionally two IIgs ROMs out there to worry about, the emulators simply patch them to accept more.  This breaks a few titles, and only recently has the Apple // retro hardware market produced a ROM adapter board to use commodity chips to replace the mask ROMs of ROM0 machines with a burned ROM01 so that you need not cannibalize ROM01 machines to upgrade.

Because LIST spaces things widely and AppleSoft generally ignores spaces, one can insert a few characters here and there by replacing spaces; larger inserts can be handled by using escape-J to move the cursor left after having imported some text, and then typing the characters to be inserted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I write a utility to continuously display the last 40 characters of the input buffer at the top of the screen; I wouldn't be surprised if some such thing exists within the Internet-connected universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="340" LastActivityDate="2016-05-18T18:14:50.890" CommentCount="2" />

The low-pass filtering of the speaker will serve to effectively mix the channels together.  Not the greatest fidelity but better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, consider the following pseudo-code to output a square wave:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;c0 = 0; f0 = 128;&#xA;loop:&#xA;   c0 = c0 + f0;&#xA;   if (c0 &amp;gt;= 128) audio_out = 1; else audio_out = 0;&#xA;   c0 = c0 % 256;&#xA;   goto loop;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;f0 = 128&lt;/code&gt; as shown the output frequency will be the maximum possible which is 1 / time-to-execute.  Let's say that works out to 50,0000 Hz.  We can output notes of different frequency by choosing different values of &lt;code&gt;f0&lt;/code&gt;.  If &lt;code&gt;f0 = 1&lt;/code&gt; then we get a 50000/128 = 390 Hz tone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To output two square waves at once simply add the code for another square wave:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;loop:&#xA;   c0 = c0 + f0;&#xA;   if (c0 &amp;gt;= 128) audio_out = 1; else audio_out = 0;&#xA;   c0 = c0 % 256;&#xA;   goto waste;&#xA;waste:&#xA;   c1 = c1 + f1;&#xA;   if (c1 &amp;gt;= 128) audio_out = 1; else audio_out = 0;&#xA;   c1 = c1 % 256;&#xA;   goto loop;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The time to execute the loop has doubled so all our frequencies have dropped in half with the maximum now 25,000 Hz.

Nevertheless, this method works fine for simple tunes which may have some simple chords (such as the kind of tunes you can achieve using the PLAY command in a Spectrum 128K)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The PWM way: this uses a modulation technique called PWM, which allows a 1-bit output driver to generate any complex sound, by varying the duty cycle of a very high fixed frequency tone. The frequency of the PWM signal is then the sampling period of a digital signal, and the number of different values the duty cycle can have is the resolution of that digital signal. For example, a PWM signal with a frequency of 10kHz and with 16 possible levels for duty cycle can encode a 4-bit digital signal with a sampling frequency of 10kHz.&#xA;There is an implementation of PWM that allows for fast operation, called sigma-delta modulation. I wrote some PoC programs for the Spectrum to illustrate this method. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/forums/discussion/comment/641855/#Comment_641855&quot;&gt;There is a thread in WOS discussing the matter&lt;/a&gt;, with some programs you can actually load and hear.

NTSC ULA's existed for some clones intended for the American market. Today they are very rare chips.&#xA;However, there are some projects that aim to design a direct replacement ULA using programable logic. These projects may support NTSC output with no effort. Besides, you would need to change the 4.43 MHz crystal with a 3.57 MHz one, and possibly some passives that belong to the LM1889 circuit.&#xA;This option, once such replacement ULAs become available, has the advantage of having everything inside the case, with no extra equipment, so you end up with a true NTSC system, with 60 Hz vertical refresh. However, the main inconvenient is that games and demos expect vertical interrupt to occur every 20ms, or 69888 CPU clock cycles. Some of them rely on these timings to perform various multicolor effects, or achieve flicker-free sprite animation.&#xA;As of today, the only ULA replacement readily available is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.retroleum.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Retroleum&lt;/a&gt;, and it is called Nebula.

AFAIK, American TVs understand composite video, YPrPb and HDMI, with some of them understanding VGA as well.&#xA;These devices perform a full frame upscaling. That is: there is a memory that serves as frame buffer, actually, with enough capacity to hold two frames. The premise is that while the image from the composite video input is being stored in one frame buffer, the other one is being read at the required speed for the output image to be rendered.&#xA;The advantage with this approach is that no matter the format or timings of the input image may have, the output image will have timings that will match your equipment. The disadvantage is that vertical refresh frequency won't be the same (specially if the input is PAL, which operates at 50 fields per second), so both frame producer and frame consumer won't be able to be in sync and sometimes, a frame that is being read by the frame consumer to produce the output will be rewritten in the middle of the operation by the frame producer, causing some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tearing&lt;/a&gt; that may be visible if the screen features full screen animation such as full screen scrolling.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is this device.

ROM chips come in standard sizes based on powers of 2 and it is quite unlikely a particular size will be exactly what a game needs.  For example, suppose a game displays numbers that are 8 x 8 pixels in size.  It will need the digits from 0 to 9, each digit needs 64 bits so a ROM of 640 bits is required.  That could be accommodated with a 512 bit and 128 bit ROM, but in terms of support circuitry, assembly costs and so on it likely is cheaper to use a 1024 bit ROM and not use the extra 384 bits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it is possible to have excess capacity without using ROMs.  But such hand-rolled solutions will naturally avoid wasting components.

They are not.  In fact, they're done by using a special-purpose chip used in handheld calculators that converts a binary number from 0 to 9 into 7 output bits that control the 7 line segments that make up the number.  That binary number is sent to the chip using 4 wires which is actually 16 combinations.  The game will only send combinations 0 through 9, what would happen if 10 through 15 were sent?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What, indeed?  It depends on the chips used, but let's say for the sake of argument that the chip will do something useful with those numbers.  Maybe light up segments that look like the letters A through F.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aha!  In that case the game has unused content!  It's pretty boring unused content, but unused content nonetheless and not a ROM in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I think it is fair and reasonable to discount these cases.  And practical, too..  ROM chips have another advantage.  We can look at their contents and figure out within the context of the hardware and software what images, audio, etc. they represent.

This is because these memories are addressed using a binary number with N bits; with N bits you can represent 2^N memory cells, so the capacity is always a power of 2. Often, the physical layout of these memories is a square, so not every power of 2 is available. Often, the exponent of the power is required to be even. That is because it's very common to have 16k DRAMs, 64k DRAMs, and 256k DRAMs but it's much less common to find 32k or 128k DRAMs (which usually are built by recycling defective 64k and 256k DRAMs)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So although you (and the CPU) sees memory as a more or less large linear array of bytes, the actual layout is more a square, so every size is available.

In short, &lt;code&gt;VIC&lt;/code&gt; needs to fetch the sprite data from memory. For each sprite it needs to fetch 3 bytes (one line of sprite shape) for each scanline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If there are sprites on the screen, the VIC needs even more cycles to&#xA;  fetch all of the graphics data. Scan lines are time divided so that&#xA;  there is enough time for all action during one line. On each line, the&#xA;  sprite image pointers are fetched during phase 1. If the sprite is to&#xA;  be displayed on that line, the three bytes of image data are fetched&#xA;  right after that. Out of these three fetches, two take place during&#xA;  phase 2 of the clock, so the processor will lose these. On average,&#xA;  two clock cycles are lost for each sprite that is displayed on that&#xA;  line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part is that it should take 24 cycles (8 sprites * 3 bytes), but in fact it takes only 16-19 cycles. This is caused by special case of sharing the &lt;code&gt;bus&lt;/code&gt; between &lt;code&gt;VIC&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CPU&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When the VIC wants to use the bus, the BA (Bus Available) signal goes&#xA;  inactive. This will happen three cycles before the bus must be&#xA;  released ! During these three cycles, the CPU must complete all memory&#xA;  accesses or delay them until it has the bus again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The CPU either completes the current instruction in the remaining&#xA;  cycles or sits and waits for the bus to become available again. It&#xA;  can't execute a new instruction as long as it doesn't have the bus.&#xA;  This is why cycles seem to be lost (besides those stolen directly for&#xA;  the sprites). Usually, all 8 sprites take 17 cycles while one sprite&#xA;  takes three cycles. However, the CPU may continue to execute an&#xA;  instruction if it does not use the bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;VIC&lt;/code&gt; is 'stealing' some cycles. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Let's suppose that all the sprites are enabled and on the same scan&#xA;  line. Then, the VIC steals 16 cycles (2 cycles for each sprite) for&#xA;  the memory fetches and 3 cycles as overhead for the BA signal, for a&#xA;  total of 19 cycles. However, it will be usually less because the CPU&#xA;  will use some of the cycles when the bus request is pending.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If we now disable sprite 4, no cycles are released for the CPU's use.&#xA;  This is because during the previous sprite 4 data fetch, the VIC&#xA;  already signals that it needs the bus for the sprite 5 data fetch and&#xA;  BA stays low (Refer to the timing chart). Thus, the CPU never sees BA&#xA;  go high during sprite 4 and 2 cycles are still lost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, if we only turn off sprites 1, 3 and 5 we get no cycles&#xA;  back from the VIC. So in time-critical raster routines, always use&#xA;  sprites in order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the concluding timing table for missing cycles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012 cycles&#xA;&#xA;Normal scan line, 0 sprites&#xA;ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggrrrrr  p p p p p p p p  phi-1 VIC&#xA;                                                                phi-2 VIC&#xA;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx phi-2 6510&#xA;63 cycles available&#xA;&#xA;Normal scan line, 8 sprites&#xA;ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggrrrrr  pspspspspspspsps phi-1 VIC&#xA;                                               ssssssssssssssss phi-2 VIC&#xA;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXX                 phi-2 6510&#xA;46-49 cycles available&#xA;&#xA;Normal scan line, 4 sprites&#xA;ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggrrrrr  psp psp psp psp  phi-1 VIC&#xA;                                               ss  ss  ss  ss   phi-2 VIC&#xA;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXX              xx phi-2 6510&#xA;48-51 cycles available&#xA;&#xA;Bad scan line, 0 sprites&#xA;ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggrrrrr  p p p p p p p p  phi-1 VIC&#xA;cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc                        phi-2 VIC&#xA;                                        xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx phi-2 6510&#xA;23 cycles available&#xA;&#xA;Bad scan line, 8 sprites&#xA;ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggrrrrr  pspspspspspspsps phi-1 VIC&#xA;cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc       ssssssssssssssss phi-2 VIC&#xA;                                        xxxxXXX                 phi-2 6510&#xA;4-7 cycles available&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;g= grafix data fetch (character images or graphics data)&#xA;r= refresh&#xA;p= sprite image pointer fetch&#xA;c= character and color CODE fetch during a bad scan line&#xA;s= sprite data fetch&#xA;x= processor executing instructions&#xA;X= processor executing an instruction, bus request pending&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use it to synchronize raster line using sprites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information (including demonstration program), please refer to the full article: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antimon.org/dl/c64/code/missing.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Missing Cycles&quot; by Pasi 'Albert' Ojala&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="423" LastEditorUserId="423" LastEditDate="2016-05-20T18:01:10.803" LastActivityDate="2016-05-20T18:01:10.803" CommentCount="4" />

Its actually a standard IDE drive, with one exception.  That 20-pin interface you're looking at isn't the IDE connector, its the connector between the drive mechanicals and the controller board that would normally be mounted to the bottom of the drive.  Why its not affixed to the bottom of the drive as normal for IDE drives I can only guess. (Space saving considerations?  Reducing the weight of the drive assembly for shock resistance?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best information I've been able to find indicates that at the other end of that cable you should find the actual controller board for the drive, plugged into a standard 40-pin IDE socket on the motherboard.  You should be able to remove the controller from the IDE socket and plug it into a standard IDE cable in another machine to recover the data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the IDE connector on the Zenith SupersPORT 286 laptop is slightly non-standard, but that should only effect things if you're trying to get another drive working with the laptop itself and shouldn't make a difference for recovering data from the CP-343.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.sys.zenith/ABBuMFnjRZ4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Discussion of Zenith IDE interface.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; It looks like the CP-343 itself is slightly out of spec for IDE.

An example - dynamically allocating a string of variable length - is located starting with line 31570:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PH 31570 GRAPHICS 0:POSITION 2,4:PRINT &quot;31750 DIM TEMP$(&quot;;FILSIZ;&quot;):RETURN&quot;&#xA;FK 31580 PRINT &quot;CONT&quot;:POSITION 2,0:POKE 842,13:STOP&#xA;FK 31590 POKE 842,12:GOSUB 31750&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;31570:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;clear screen (&lt;code&gt;GRAPHICS 0&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;position the cursor leaving a little room above (&lt;code&gt;POSITION 2,4&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Output the text of the program line that is to be added/changed. In this case, that's creation (or on subsequent runs overwrite) of line 31750 which contains a subroutine, allocating space for a new variable, and returning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;31580:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the next line, output the command &lt;code&gt;CONT&lt;/code&gt; - this command makes sense only in immediate context - used in a program it would trigger 'already running' error.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Position the cursor at the topmost line of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Perform a &quot;magical&quot; &lt;code&gt;POKE 842,13&lt;/code&gt; - I'm not sure what's 'behind the scenes' - 842 is the ICAX1 register, but I only managed to find the meaning of its 2 and 3 (device open for read and write); not bit 0 which is toggled here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Perform 'STOP'. This is mostly equivalent to pressing BREAK - aborting the activity of the program, in a way that is resumable by the CONT instruction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The moment the &quot;Magical Poke&quot; is executed Atari begins outputting the Return key repeatedly. The program is aborted before the cursor reaches the text on screen, so when it does, the computer is in immediate mode, but with &quot;jammed Return&quot;. Whatever lines the cursor rides through, are executed as if they were typed in. In that case, that's the line preceded by the number - which gets written into the program - and then, the line CONT, which resumes execution from the next command after STOP. Which happens to be...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;31590:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;POKE 842,12&lt;/code&gt; to cancel the cursor madness&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GOSUB 31750&lt;/code&gt; - execute the newly entered line.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, what the program actually does:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;open the binary file for reading.

(31610)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enter them using the self-programming trick (31720),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Erase self from memory, using the self-programming trick.

I will answer this from an electrical engineering perspective, and because I have implemented some of these fixes myself. First a little note about &lt;em&gt;timing fixes&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The expression &lt;em&gt;timing fixes&lt;/em&gt; is not really accurate, but comes from the observation that an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#RC_filter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;RC filter&lt;/a&gt; (Resistor-Capacitor) will affect a digital step in a way that, after thresholding at an input of a digital circuit, looks like it has been delayed in time:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/RC-RC-RC-RC_Delay.png&quot; alt=&quot;A simple time delay&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a pretty bad and unreliable way to delay a fast digital signal, and to my knowledge, this is not really what the fixes do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Ringing. Overshoot. Impedance mismatch.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Designing large circuit boards with multiple clock signals is not easy. Signals actually &lt;em&gt;bounce&lt;/em&gt; when they reach junctions or connections, causing reflections and other impurities:&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.ni.com/cms/images/devzone/tut/a/2170dcae1750.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution is called &lt;em&gt;termination&lt;/em&gt;, and you may have seen it used in other settings, for example in SCSI cabling. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DovunOxlY1k&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a great video on the subject, from 1959.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a signal from point A to point B, the correct termination can be calculated, but for distributed signals like the Amiga clock signals, it's not that easy. Especially so if you want to allow everyone to just plug in random boards to the same signals. The (arguably) &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; solution is to use special circuits called &lt;em&gt;clock distribution&lt;/em&gt; circuits, but you can usually get away with cheaper solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The common way is to add &lt;em&gt;termination resistors&lt;/em&gt;. This works well, but only when you know about everything connected to the bus. This is where the problem lies: Adding an expansion board to the bus will change the electrical parameters on the network, invalidating the previously calculated resistances. This does not necessarily break things. The signals only have to be &quot;good enough&quot;. After all, that's why we are using digital signals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the question of electrical interference. A nice and clean clock signal will, counterproductively, cause a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintentional_radiator&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;electromagnetic interference&lt;/a&gt;. This can be mitigated by adding capacitors to smooth the sharp edges. Doing so is bad for the signal, and is preferably avoided, but can be a last resort fix to get the product out of the door.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ianstedman.co.uk/Amiga/amiga_hacks/A1200_Mobo_fix/a1200_mobo_fix.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ian Stedman&lt;/a&gt; has collected some information about the various fixes proposed in the forums, and the main components are: &lt;strong&gt;E121&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;E122&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;E123&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;E125&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amigawiki.org/doku.php?id=en:service:schematics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;schematics&lt;/a&gt; for the Amiga 1200 we can locate these components, and they are all connected to the CPU clock signal. A note on the schematics say&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Note: Various components are for EMI Control and may be loaded with funny things...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...and another one...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Note: Components designated as Exxx may be loaded with EMI fliters[sic], ferrite beads or resistors!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can also see that there is an asterisk near these components. What all this means is that the engineer(s) simply added the components to the schematic in case they found out that they are necessary. Some of these are not populated, and some are (This is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common and you will see a lot of unpopulated components on almost every circuit board). It could very well be that they did not plan to populate the components, but wanted the option of doing so in case any unforeseen problems arose. Eventually, someone down the line either put components there by mistake, or after measuring the final product and observing that the components are necessary. Everyone working in consumer electronics manufacturing can probably tell a lot of stories about this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Suggested answer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there one set of fixes that will fix all hardware stability issues with the Amiga 1200?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Probably&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fixes consists of fitting or removing these components. Every Exxx component has two parts: A resistor and a capacitor. The resistor (&lt;em&gt;ExxxR&lt;/em&gt;) can either be left out, fitted, or replaced with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrite_bead&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ferrite bead&lt;/a&gt;. The capacitor (&lt;em&gt;ExxxC&lt;/em&gt;) can either be fitted or left out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=60387&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;English Amiga Board&lt;/em&gt; suggests these fixes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E123R&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;E125R&lt;/strong&gt; - Fit with the value indicated in the schematics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E121R&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;E122R&lt;/strong&gt; - Fit or replace with a 60 Ω ferrite bead&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E123C&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;E125C&lt;/strong&gt; - Fit with the value indicated in the schematics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E121C&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;E122C&lt;/strong&gt; - Replace with 27 pF capacitors&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to that advice, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1232&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Individual Computer's wiki&lt;/a&gt; has an article about the capacitors and instead strongly recommend that they are to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, removing the capacitors and leaving everything else as they are is the best advice. I have a feeling that doing this on every motherboard, no matter the revision, will fix any issues with accelerator boards. I have three reasons for recommending this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The capacitors are only added to pass an artificial test. Other than that, they do more harm than good to the signals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a technically sound reason for the resistors as designed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any unnecessary rework has a chance of damaging the board or other components.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No need to order new parts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do the timing fixes needed depend on the CPU accelerator used?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Probably not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not seen any good comparative data on this. People often mention Apollo boards to be extra problematic, but I have personally had to perform the modifications on an old Amiga 1200 for a Blizzard accelerator board.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, as mentioned by Kuba Tyszko in a comment, if your accelerator board works, it is not necessary to risk damage by doing any of these mods. If, however, you experience unusual instability, it may be worth trying to remove the capacitors. I have nothing to back this up (yet), but I believe that this will improve the situation for every accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please leave a comment if you believe something here is wrong or unclear, and I will try to update the answer.

Most of the bits are generic (i.e., the mean the same to all devices), but &lt;code&gt;$1&lt;/code&gt; (bit 0) does seem to have a special meaning:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;; AUX1 EQUATES&#xA;; () INDICATES WHICH DEVICES USE BIT&#xA;APPEND  =     $1          ;OPEN FOR WRITE APPEND (D), OR SCREEN READ (&#xA;DIRECT  =     $2          ;OPEN FOR DIRECTORY ACCESS (D)&#xA;OPNIN   =     $4          ;OPEN FOR INPUT (ALL DEVICES)&#xA;OPNOT   =     $8          ;OPEN FOR OUTPUT (ALL DEVICES)&#xA;OPNINO  =     OPNIN+OPNOT ;OPEN FOR INPUT AND OUTPUT (ALL DEVICES)&#xA;MXDMOD  =     $10         ;OPEN FOR MIXED MODE (E,S)&#xA;INSCLR  =     $20         ;OPEN WITHOUT CLEARING SCREEN (E,S)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The OS defines several devices including the keyboard, cassette, printer and disk each with a corresponding I/O Control Block (or IOCB).  You'll notice that the normal value for 842 is 12 which means &lt;code&gt;OPNIN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OPNOT&lt;/code&gt; are both set.  The device is open for read and write access.  When you &lt;code&gt;POKE&lt;/code&gt; 13 into 842 the &lt;code&gt;APPEND&lt;/code&gt; bit is set.  For the cassette or disk that might mean you're adding to the end of a file.  For the keyboard device it has the special effect you're wondering about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;POKE 842,4&lt;/code&gt; has no obvious effect - BASIC never tries to write to the keyboard so turning off &lt;code&gt;OPNOT&lt;/code&gt; does nothing.  But a &lt;code&gt;POKE 842,8&lt;/code&gt; is bad.  BASIC will spew an undending stream of &lt;code&gt;ERROR - 131&lt;/code&gt; messages as it tries to read input from the keyboard but is denied because read access has been turned off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="301" LastActivityDate="2016-05-23T21:01:31.633" CommentCount="2" />

Lawson claims he started working on the&#xA;  game in 1972 or 1973 and sold it to Major Manufacturers of San Mateo,&#xA;  CA. Some sources (including the Wikipedia article on Lawson) claim&#xA;  that the game &quot;debuted&quot; shortly after the release of Pong. The F-8,&#xA;  however, was not released until 1975 and Major Manufacturers was not&#xA;  incorporated until October of 1974. The October, 1975 issue of Play&#xA;  Meter announced that at the 1975 MOA show (the same show where Gun&#xA;  Fight was introduced), Major Manufacturers would be &quot;…. introducing&#xA;  two new upright games that use a microprocessor...instead of a logic&#xA;  board, as well as exhibiting their line of video games and a new&#xA;  designer cocktail table&quot;. The article does not name any of these&#xA;  games, nor do any other issues of Replay or Play Meter. It is not&#xA;  clear from the description if the microprocessor games were video&#xA;  games or not. The October, 1975 issue of Vending Times, however, does&#xA;  list two games that the company was to display at the MOA: Lunar&#xA;  Module and Fascination - but does not mention whether they use a&#xA;  microprocessor. The 1972/1973 date thus seems clearly too early, at&#xA;  least for a microprocessor version of Demolition Derby (though Lawson&#xA;  could have started with a non-microprocessor version). In addition,&#xA;  only one copy of Demolition Derby is thought to have been built and it&#xA;  never went past the field testing stage. On the other hand, while it&#xA;  seems unlikely that it was field tested prior to 1975, given that&#xA;  Major Manufacturers did plan to show microprocessor games at the 1975&#xA;  MOA, it (or one of Major's other games) may have been tested prior to&#xA;  the release of Gun Fight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://allincolorforaquarter.blogspot.com/2013/07/dave-needle-and-jerry-lawon-two-early.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="621" LastActivityDate="2016-05-24T16:59:06.620" CommentCount="0" />

Just &lt;code&gt;fdformat&lt;/code&gt; the floppy device for 1.44MiB as you would for any other DOS/Windows/Linux machine and write the image using a command like,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd bs=512 if=floppy_image.img of=/dev/floppy&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if the image you are using comes from Apple, it will not be raw.  It will be either a Disk Copy image (819284 bytes) or a &lt;code&gt;.sea&lt;/code&gt; self-extracting disk image, possibly with a BinHex (&lt;code&gt;.bin&lt;/code&gt;) wrapper.  We'll address that first since it's far more common.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the image is wrapped in BinHex, we can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://unarchiver.c3.cx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Unarchiver's &lt;code&gt;unar&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;lsar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to unpack the file.  Note, you'd be wise to use &lt;code&gt;lsar&lt;/code&gt; on the file first as Macintosh files contain characters like spaces rather commonly and &lt;code&gt;unar&lt;/code&gt; does not provide an option to rename the output file during extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point I recommend renaming or copying the &lt;code&gt;.sea&lt;/code&gt; file to one ending in the &lt;code&gt;.dmg&lt;/code&gt; extension and running &lt;code&gt;truncate -s 819284 your_image.dmg&lt;/code&gt; to produce a Disk Copy image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now to convert that to a raw image, you can use &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; to trim off the Disk Copy header:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd bs=84 skip=1 if=disk_image.dmg of=disk_image.img&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leaves you with a raw disk image suitable for use with emulators or writing to a floppy as above.

Similar tricks can be used for Apple // ProDOS and GS/OS disk images if the machine is equipped with a SuperDrive and controller or other PC-compatible 1.44MB drive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may be other common disk formats I am not aware of for the early Macintosh.

It's called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMIT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;COMIT&lt;/a&gt;, and it dates back to 1957, just &lt;em&gt;one year&lt;/em&gt; after Kleene's work was published. Wikipedia calls it the &quot;first string processing language&quot;, so it fits the bill very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia also says that its creation led to the creation of SNOBOL. After reading up on SNOBOL a bit, I realized it's actually pretty powerful too, capable of parsing Context-free grammars (CFGs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015040285333;view=1up;seq=13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;An introduction to COMIT programming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the best reference for the grammar that I've found so far. Keep in mind, it's an ENTIRE programming language. I am sure it's possible to do all of the things I mentioned; the language is Turing-complete, but it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/T87-1009&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seems&lt;/a&gt; like it is geared towards non-recursive parsing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The syntaxes for the &quot;patterns&quot; and the &quot;strings&quot; are a little weird (but mutually similar), so I doubt that modern regex syntax was derived from it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(The oldest regex flavor with syntax like modern regexes that I know of are Unix utilities, as dirkt mentioned: grep, ed, sed, awk. This could be an entirely different question to ask about.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Characters can be grouped together into arbitrary groups called &lt;em&gt;constituents&lt;/em&gt;, which are separated by plus signs. Ironically, my initial example of concatenation is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;C + A + T&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can also be written as one constituent:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CAT&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To include a space, the dash (&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;) character is used:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;THE + -CAT&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, as a single constituent:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;THE-CAT&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strings are stored in memory called the &lt;em&gt;workspace&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;Rules&quot; are matched against the workspace, and replacements can be made. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's pretty easy to do a replacement, actually. To change &lt;code&gt;THE-CAT&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;THE-DOG&lt;/code&gt;, you could use this rule:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* CAT = DOG *&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deletion is easy too. To remove &lt;code&gt;THE-&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;THE-DOG&lt;/code&gt;, you could use this rule:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* THE- = 0 *&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;code&gt;DOG&lt;/code&gt; and wanted to double the &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt;, you could use numbers. Numbers are meta characters, as my deletion example shows you. Ignoring &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, they have a similar meaning to modern capture groups, if you imagine each constituent as a capture group. For example, &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; could be doubled by using the following rule:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* G = 1 + 1 *&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(No, one plus one isn't two, it's &lt;code&gt;GG&lt;/code&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving onto more complex constructs, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; is essentially equivalent to the modern &lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt;. On the other hand, in order to do something similar to the modern &lt;code&gt;.{3}&lt;/code&gt; (three characters), you would use &lt;code&gt;$3&lt;/code&gt; in COMIT (assuming each constituent was a character, I think).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you had &lt;code&gt;THE-CAT + , + -WHO-WISHED + -IT-WAS + -A-DOG + , + -BARKED&lt;/code&gt; and you wanted to remove everything between the commas, you would use:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* , + $ + , = 0 *&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like I said, there's a whole lot more past this.

Most debugging isn't adversarial: the code being debugged isn't actively taking measures against the debugger, so the debugger doesn't need to actively protect itself. (If a bug destroys the debugger as well as the program being debugged, well...) The debugger can offer configuration options to the end-user to facilitate things of course, but there will always be limitations that the end-user will have to live with (using a debugger leaves less RAM for the program being debugged, it might use some interrupts that the program would want for itself, etc.) — all told though the gain from having a hosted debugger makes it worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some early debuggers used extra hardware, without special CPU support, to reduce the level of compromise:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;hosting the debugger in a cartridge means the code can't be touched&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a cartridge can also provide extra RAM, which means the debugger's working state doesn't reduce the amount of memory available (at least, on systems with less RAM than their address space)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;but, without a MMU, all this still happens in the same address space (even if banking is involved) so it's only reliable in non-adversarial debugging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adversarial debugging, or any form of complex debugging really (kernel debugging etc.) requires hardware support.

Having a full 16-bit adder would avoid the page-boundary penalty for branch instructions, but wouldn't help with indexed loads.  By the time the CPU fetches the upper byte of a base address, the 8-bit ALU will have already done everything it needs to do with the lower half of the address, and would be available to compute the upper half.  The reason the 6502 can't immediately issue the next access for a page-crossed address isn't that the ALU is too short, but rather that it's too slow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each time the 6502 receives a byte of data it must &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; turn around and supply the next address.  In cases where the upper or lower byte of the next address matches the fetched data verbatim, the data can be latched and ready for the next cycle, but in all other cases the 6502 must output the next address before it has had a chance to examine the newly-fetched byte.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compare the execution of ADC 12,X and ADC $3456,X.  In either case, the&#xA;6502 will start by fetching the opcode (possibly while finishing up the&#xA;previous instruction).  Even while it's fetching the opcode, it knows&#xA;what it will do next cycle (fetch the following byte).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the CPU is fetching the byte following the opcode, it can look at&#xA;the first byte and determine that it's going to need to add the byte&#xA;that it's fetching to the value in x.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the third cycle of either instruction, the CPU will add the value&#xA;fetched in the second cycle to the value in X.  When using the ADC $3456,X&#xA;instruction, the CPU will have something else useful it can do at&#xA;the same time: fetch the upper byte of the address.  When using the&#xA;ADC $12,X instruction, however, there won't be anything nothing useful&#xA;for the CPU to do while performing the address computation, so it will&#xA;just perform a dummy cycle with the last thing on the bus ($12).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In either case, the fourth cycle will use the newly-calculated address along with either $00 [for the ZP,X form] or the newly-fetched upper byte [for the ABS,X form].  During that cycle, the ABS,X instruction will also compute&#xA;the value of (upper byte + 1) in case that turns out to be needed, and will&#xA;figure out what should happen on the cycle after that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it turns out that there was no carry from the lower half, then instruction execution will be complete so the 6502 can fetch the next instruction while it actually adds the newly-fetched value to the accumulator.  Otherwise the 6502 will have to add another cycle to perform a fetch from the correct address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the 6502 to avoid a cycle penalty when an indexed load crosses a page boundary, it would have to have something useful it could do during that cycle.  Adding a little sequencing logic might make it possible for the 6502 to unconditionally fetch of the first byte of the next opcode during the address computation stage, but the 6502 normally uses the first instruction-fetch cycle to perform &quot;cleanup&quot; from the previous instruction.  Pushing the cleanup to the second cycle of an instruction might be possible, but would require adding some additional internal registers and logic.

NASA using magnetic-core memory in 80's, cars using relays instead of solid-state to control starter motor, Amtrak using rotary converters, etc, etc. The main point is not about absolute reliability, it's about better understanding of failure modes. When you have good understanding of failure modes, you can simply overengineer that particular aspect or put in procedures to circumvent the problem. Being able to predict it with good certainty is all that it takes to achieve the best possible reliability. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="843" LastEditorUserId="843" LastEditDate="2016-06-03T15:11:20.473" LastActivityDate="2016-06-03T15:11:20.473" CommentCount="0" />

The first thing is the odd division into three blocks -- this was done so that if you have a pointer to a scan line of a character block stored in a register pair (e.g. HL) you can just increment the high order byte (e.g. with an inc h instruction) to get a pointer to the next scan line of the same character block. In order for this to work, there must be exactly 256 character blocks between successive scan lines so the bitmap must be divided into groups of 256/32 = 8 rows. This simplifies (and accelerates) the code for printing a character substantially. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other odd thing is something that I've seen commented on less frequently, and this is the unusual order of the colour components in the attributes. AFAICT the reason for this is that the designers wanted a system that would produce reasonable grayscale output if hooked up to a black &amp;amp; white TV. They therefore designed it so that each colour component was also associated with a brightness level, which were picked according to the human eye's sensitive for the colours, i.e. green brightest, then red, then blue.  Then, by putting the brightest in the most significant bit and the darkest in the least, they could have the colours appear in numeric order of brightness when viewed on a black and white output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="547" LastActivityDate="2016-06-07T08:28:23.480" CommentCount="0" />

In other countries it is nowhere near so clear cut.  There is a shortage in most countries of court cases where people have been prosecuted for &lt;em&gt;downloading&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;uploading&lt;/em&gt;, which makes determining the precise legal position in those countries difficult. It may be true, for example, that if you have purchased a piece of software that this grants you a license to make any reproductions of that software that are necessary in order to be able to use it (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicknowledge.org/files/CopiesRightsCopyrightsPKThinks2013.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;page 9 of this document for a summary of the position in the US&lt;/a&gt;).  It does not seem to be the case (at least in most countries' laws) that there is any restriction on &lt;em&gt;how you make those reproductions&lt;/em&gt;, and if they come from the Internet rather than from your own original source, that seems to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Phantom_distinction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;distinction without a difference&lt;/a&gt;.  So I'd argue that, at least in many jurisdictions, if a case where a consumer who owned an original copy of software and then downloaded the same from the Internet because it was the only way they could make the software work ever came to court, such a prosecution would have at least a good chance of failing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.

Its implementation was based upon the &quot;message loop&quot; architecture of every Windows program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The duty of every program was to endlessly run in a loop in which a call to &lt;code&gt;GetMessage()&lt;/code&gt; function was performed. This function call looks whether a message to this process is in the queue. If there is one, it is retrieved (&lt;code&gt;GetMessage&lt;/code&gt;), optionally translated (&lt;code&gt;TranslateMessage&lt;/code&gt;, this is done to convert keyboard shortcuts into menu actions) and finally, passed to the window procedure (&lt;code&gt;DispatchMessage&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is no message available in the queue, Windows suspends the current task and gives the CPU to other task, which will try to retrieve a message from its queue as well, yielding the CPU to another task if no message is present.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a program needed to perform background tasks while there was no pending messages in its queue, it would call &lt;code&gt;PeekMessage&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;GetMessage&lt;/code&gt;. This didn't make the task to relinquish the CPU, as &lt;code&gt;PeekMessage&lt;/code&gt; would inmediately return to the caller task informing whether a message is available or not.

Limitations on exclusive rights: Computer programs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(a) Making of Additional Copy or Adaptation by Owner of Copy.—Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is &lt;strong&gt;not an infringement&lt;/strong&gt; for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(1) that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I doubt that this was the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of that bit of law, but this does give some wiggle room for the site owners to at least argue that what they/their users are doing is legal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, copyright law does also vary (somewhat) with locale. Depending on where their servers are located, it's at least possible that the law there is somewhat less strict.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's another technicality that figures in here as well: most of copyright law is more or less aimed at a situation such as another publisher taking a work and selling the misappropriated work for their own profit. To do that, the person/group who's misappropriated the work normally has to make copies, then offer them for sale--and much of most copyright law is written to prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a case like this, where the site isn't actually making copies, but is merely placing the work in a situation where somebody else can make copies, many of those provisions sort of fall apart. So, the basic rights under US copyright law are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;§ 106 . Exclusive rights in copyrighted works&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, let's consider these one at a time:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The site isn't really reproducing the copyrighted work, except to the degree that (for example) a web cache server held all or part of a copy of the work.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't appear that they're preparing any derivative works. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don't see anything indicating that they're claiming to transfer ownership, lease, or lend the work (&quot;lending&quot; carries the specific idea of the item being returned, not being permanently transferred).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;through 6. clearly don't apply to an operating system (nor probably to any computer program).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's another provision in §108, that says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(d) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section apply to a copy, made from the collection of a library or archives where the user makes his or her request or from that of another library or archives, of no more than one article or other contribution to a copyrighted collection or periodical issue, or to a copy or phonorecord of a small part of any other copyrighted work, if—&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  (1) the copy or phonorecord becomes the property of the user, and the library or archives has had no notice that the copy or phonorecord would be used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research; and&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  (2) the library or archives displays prominently, at the place where orders are accepted, and includes on its order form, a warning of copyright in accordance with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was originally intended to apply to things like a copying machine at a library. If I go to the library and make a copy of something on the copying machine, &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; responsible, not the library. If (for example) I'm disabled, and ask one of their employees to make the copy, I'm still responsible for it, not them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question in this case would be whether the web site qualifies as a library or archive. The fact that the site at least appears to be open to the general public seems to let it meet the legal requirements to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn't just stretching a technicality to apply to the current situation either. The basic idea is fairly simple: a library or archive should be free to provide source material, and even provide copying equipment to their patrons. As long as they take the steps required by the law to tell/remind the patrons that wholesale copying may infringe a copyright, it's the patrons, not the library/archive, who are responsible for the copyright infringement. That seems to fit extremely well with what's happening here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That means just about any infringement that might occur would have to be on the part of the person doing the downloading, not the web site itself. Here (again) the first point brought up from §117 still (at least potentially) applies--it may still be legal. Of course, there's also the possibility that the downloader is simply somebody who (at some point in the past) actually bought a license to the program they're downloading/using. In that case, if that license hasn't ever been transferred to anybody else (and most contain provisions saying you &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; transfer them) then the user is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; still authorized to install and use it (e.g., most older license agreements don't contain any limit on how long the license lasts).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: as I originally said, the situation here isn't really cut and dried. If the site were to be sued and the case were being heard in a US court, I'd guess there would be better than even odds that the court would shut down the site--but honestly, only a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; better than even odds. I wouldn't come as a huge surprise to me at all if the site could successfully defend themselves as being a publicly available archive, and any copyright infringement was the responsibility of the users, not the archive itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as other countries go: in theory, copyright law is fairly uniform between a large number of countries. There are quite a few international agreements (starting from the Berne convention of 1886) about copyrights and copyright law. In reality, however, there's still quite a bit of variation--but I'd say the US tends to favor copyright holders at least as much as almost any country, so if such a suit were brought in another country, the chances of the site being held responsible would be no greater, and in many cases would be much lower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="808" LastEditorUserId="808" LastEditDate="2016-06-11T03:07:50.173" LastActivityDate="2016-06-11T03:07:50.173" CommentCount="12" />

For example, if you decided to draw a dot at each possible position on the screen, you would indeed be limited to specific, discrete positions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not the whole story though. Much of the reason for high resolution on a raster display is to keep lines from looking &quot;jaggy&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/SMuuY.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/SMuuY.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a raster display, the slanted line is made up of discrete pixels at specific positions. Especially with a line like this that's nearly horizontal (or nearly vertical) those discrete steps are quite visible (even on a display with fairly high resolution).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a vector display, you don't get that though. What happens is that you move the beam to a position, turn on the beam, then move it to some other position. The line that's drawn is essentially perfectly straight from the start point to the end point. You don't get a stair-step effect from one to the other at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern graphics hardware has a number of tricks (mostly anti-aliasing of various sorts) to minimize the visibility of these jagged artifacts--but they never really eliminate them like a vector display does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: from one perspective, the Vectrex display has quite low resolution--but from another perspective, its resolution is essentially infinite. It's enough different that there's no resolution of raster display that's really equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="808" LastActivityDate="2016-06-08T05:54:10.370" CommentCount="6" />

This can manifest itself as the Amiga showing some signs of life (power LED and video signal) but not booting. I've also heard that poor-quality video and audio can be a symptom of failing capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fix for this is straightforward - replace the capacitors! Expired capacitors generally won't cause any knock-on damage so replacing the capacitor will often fix problems. Those experienced at soldering can do this job themselves, and the replacement parts are relatively cheap. There are some specialist Amiga online stores who often stock capacitor packs for the different models of Amiga. For those not willing to put a soldering iron to their precious Amiga mainboard, there are again Amiga specialists who provide a &quot;recapping&quot; service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second problem you're likely to see is a leaking battery. Not all Amigas have onboard batteries, but those that did used an NiCd rechargeable battery. When these get old they tend to leak, and this is more likely if it has not been actively used for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike failing capacitors, a failing NiCd battery is &lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt; news. They leak a corrosive alkaline which can eat through the traces of the mainboard, and corrode metal parts - a leaking battery can cause extensive damage. If your Amiga has an NiCd battery you would be advised to remove it immediately! Even if it hasn't leaked &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; it is still a potential problem in the near future. Removing it is a simple as using snips to cut through the metal connections to the mainboard, or even just rocking the battery back-and-forth until the connections shear off. Remember that the battery has corrosive alkaline so protect your hands suitably.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the battery &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; leaked, then you should immediately take steps to clean off the corrosive alkaline before the damage gets any worse. A web search for cleaning PCBs should provide some guides to this, but essentially you should use a brush to apply a weak acid (such as vinegar) to the corroded areas of the board (don't be surprised if it starts fizzing - this means that the acid is neutralising the alkaline) followed by rinsing with deionised water and leaving to dry thoroughly. Then you will need to carefully inspect and test for whatever damage the alkaline may have done. Repairing may take some advanced skills. Finally, if you still want to have a working RTC battery, then there are ways to attach a socket for a CR2032 button cell in place of the NiCd battery, which is a much safer alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately not all Amigas had onboard batteries - only the &quot;big box&quot; Amigas and the A500+. The basic 500, 600 and 1200 do not have batteries. However RAM expansions such as the A501 may have NiCd batteries and therefore the same problem applies there too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Disclaimer: the above is guidance based on what I have read elsewhere and my own experiences, but it is not expert advice.

What this means is that, when a modern Intel (or AMD) processor boots up, it starts in a mode which is compatible with the 8088 — if the motherboard's BIOS support is good enough, you can still boot MS-DOS on a brand-new PC (albeit not from a floppy disk!). (Presumably you could also boot CP/M-86, but I haven't tried that. Other 16-bit operating systems, such as OS/2, Coherent or Xenix, are more demanding and tend not to work — &lt;a href=&quot;http://virtuallyfun.superglobalmegacorp.com/&quot;&gt;Fun with virtualization&lt;/a&gt; goes into the specifics). The 8088 is a 16-bit CPU, inasmuch as it processes data internally 16 bits at a time. As newer CPUs introduced wider internal data busses, new modes were added to support them, so you get 32-bit binaries and now 64-bit binaries, and it's even possible to mix and match. So a modern, 64-bit &lt;em&gt;x86&lt;/em&gt;-compatible CPU can still run 16-bit binary code, at least in some modes (64-bit mode, or &quot;long mode&quot;, doesn't support real-mode 16-bit code; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_8086_mode#64-bit_and_VMX_support&quot;&gt;it's possible to work around this using VT-x&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Running an application doesn't just require CPU support though, it also requires operating system support. So you can't just take a 16-bit DOS or Windows binary and run it on a Linux system, or even on a Windows 10 system — you need some sort of emulation layer, not for the CPU, but for the operating system services. This is where tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dosbox.com/&quot;&gt;DOSBox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winehq.org/&quot;&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; come in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What would it mean to run an 8-bit binary on an &lt;em&gt;x86&lt;/em&gt; CPU? On the CPU side, the closest 8-bit CPU is the 8080, but the 8088/8086 is different enough that it's not binary-compatible with the 8080; so you can't directly run an 8080 binary on an 8088, let alone on a more modern &lt;em&gt;x86&lt;/em&gt; CPU. On the operating system side, the best you could hope for would be that your application was built for CP/M; so you'd need some sort of CP/M-compatible layer (or perhaps CP/M-86 or DOS which was somewhat backwards-compatible).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/users/105/mcleod-ideafix&quot;&gt;mcleod_ideafix&lt;/a&gt; points out, the &lt;em&gt;x86&lt;/em&gt; is source-code compatible with the 8080, &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; the 8088 supports all the features of the 8080 and the Intel assembler mnemonics for the 8080 can be (in most cases) mechanically converted to equivalent 8088 assembly. But you'd still need to adapt the application to the target operating system, as well as the new target CPU. (Stephen P. Morse's &lt;a href=&quot;http://stevemorse.org/8086history/8086history.doc&quot;&gt;8086 history&lt;/a&gt; covers this in more detail.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in summary, you can't take an 8-bit binary and run it directly on an &lt;em&gt;x86&lt;/em&gt; processor. If you're careful, you may be able to rebuild an 8-bit 8080 assembly language program for the 8088, and run it under CP/M-86 or DOS. Thanks to the &lt;em&gt;x86&lt;/em&gt; architecture's support for 8-bit operations, you can write an 8-bit style application (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; using only 8-bit arithmetic and logical operations, but 16-bit pointers) and run it on a 16-bit operating system (the BIOS supports this rather well, as does DOS). But to me this isn't quite the same as the 16-bit and 32-bit support on modern 64-bit systems, because the 16-bit nature of the architecture leaks into its 8-bit support: for example, 8-bit &lt;code&gt;DIV&lt;/code&gt; always divides the 16-bit &lt;code&gt;AX&lt;/code&gt;, which means you can't simply pretend &lt;code&gt;AL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;AH&lt;/code&gt; are separate 8-bit registers unless you avoid &lt;code&gt;DIV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MUL&lt;/code&gt; etc. entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;QEMU itself doesn't emulate any 8-bit CPUs.

This basically means that if you have the original assembly file of a program, you can rougly translate it to x86 bytecode. Of course, you still need some form of assembly file to compile it, but you might have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation&quot;&gt;Dynamic Recompilation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, just executing code isn't everything for an emulated system. In fact, most 8-bit systems will use some form of Memory-mapped I/O or Port-mapped I/O. Of course, there is always the possibility to detect those, and then replace them with a call to a function defined by the emulator. The same goes, for example, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80&quot;&gt;Z-80&lt;/a&gt; opcodes, which are used a lot and which are basically incompatible with x86.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real matter, however, is the fact that you wont need recompilation. In fact, most of those systems from the 80's did have clock rates in the 1-5mHz rate. When you run this on a Gigahertz CPU, you would only need a really tiny fraction of the CPU time. Of course, this is a little different when implementing a later system, like some arcade systems, but those doesn't tend to use 8-bit CPU's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, the complexity of using dynamic recompilation to catch all those cases isn't worth the try. Use a good, well tested x80/z80 emulation library, or write your own for the matter, it is much easier, saver, and makes your code also a little bit more portable, in case you would have to port it to a smartphone, for exemple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1965" LastActivityDate="2016-06-10T08:43:09.823" CommentCount="0" />

Some abandonware sites don't host software when this is done, but how the companies feel about illegal copying of the original versions of the software is difficult to assess and probably varies from company to company. This is particularly an issue among die-hard retrocomputing enthusiasts, as often the re-released version of the software is modified slightly (all sorts of reasons, ranging from censoring previously-accepted content to &quot;locking&quot; the software so that it will only run with the bundled emulation software and not on original hardware, or even just changing the title screen with a new copyright date) and some enthusiasts want a more authentic experience and still try to obtain the original version (usually illegally).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, WinWorldPC is most likely illegal but most people don't care what they do with old software and so neither themselves nor you are very likely to get into any trouble.

  <row Id="900" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="899" CreationDate="2016-06-12T01:29:52.600" Score="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;The 8080 is not a microcontroller, but a microprocessor, so it had no special provision for LCD displays, as modern microcontroller may have, except maybe for the ability to use packed BCD numbers. It had no in-built host peripherals that would support protocols like RS232 or SPI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don't mention what kind of LCD display your college used, so this is only an assumption (and your question may be put on hold precisely due to the lack of information about this) but for the most basic LCD display, a 7-segment display, the software may have used BCD for storing numbers. That way, a number could be easily output from the data bus (8-bit parallel) to a latch &quot;listening&quot; in a I/O port. The output of that latch could be feed a BCD-to-7 segment converter/driver, with in turn would be connected to the display.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the protocol would have been 8-bit parallel (the 8080 data bus) with strobe (the signal generated by the address and bus cycle decoding , that is used to open the latch). This would have been work like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, the current machine cycle must be decoded in order to know whether it is a I/O operation, memory operation, stack, instruction fetch, etc. The 8080 didn't have special pins, like the Z80A, to inform the system about the nature of the machine cycle. Instead of that, the 8080 used the SYNC pin to signal the beginning of a machine cycle, whose type would be encoded in the data bus during the time SYNC is active. The 8080 chipset included a machien cycle decoder, the 8212 controller, that was connected to the 8080 as this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/oYQtE.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/oYQtE.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the hardware designer would have to use a 8-bit latch whose enable input would be triggered by certain value present in the lower part of the address bus (or most frequenctly, triggered by having a certain value in some bit of the lower address bus), and the WR signal and the OUT signal from the 8212. This 8 bit value, if packed BCD coded, can feed two 7-segment displays to show two digits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="105" LastEditorUserId="105" LastEditDate="2016-06-12T02:07:10.080" LastActivityDate="2016-06-12T02:07:10.080" CommentCount="1" />
