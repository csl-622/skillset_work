I can tell you that on the longer arms you can indeed rotate to portrait without a problem (also makes cabling them up easier). In the video the joint used looks the same and it seems to be rotatable.  You will need to move the longer arms out of the way to rotate the middle one but then you can just move them back - you will also have to mount it high enough to allow for rotation into portrait - my preferred viewing height was sufficient to do this without modification."
