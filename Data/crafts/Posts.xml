This can also reduce your control of the cut. I am in favour of moving both the work and your hand at the same time. I find this makes the motions easier and they take less time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Should I hold the knife vertically or diagonally on the paper?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the cut would naturally be at a slight angle with what I am describing, I would try to avoid doing so and try to cut as vertically as possible.

If your cuts meet on top but are not completely vertical then a tuft would appear on the bottom of the paper, for example. This can be hard to work with since the blade of a craft knife is already at an angle. This leads into one possible solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on what you are willing to get away with as far as quality or experience, one surefire way to try and address this is to over-cut your lines just a bit. When trying to meet at an edge or a corner it sounds like you are coming a bit short. That is what is creating the tufts. If you over-cut the line just a bit that should account for that and make the corner or edge clean. Problem with this approach is if done wrong you can cut too far in which can ruin the piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don't even have to do it too much. Just enough to account for my first paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am sure you are already doing this but for the sake of completeness your cutting surface plays a role here. Something simple like a self healing cutting mat will help prevent your paper from moving too much. Sometimes changes in hand pressure can move the paper enough that it starts to pull away from the cut line. A proper mat should help immobilize the work more. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Usually I use printer paper or origami paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not sure if this is the best advice, as it could be tedious to consider, but common computer/printer paper has a grain direction. If you look at a common 8 1/2 x 11 you should see that the fibers are lined up from top to bottom. You can also &quot;feel&quot; this when you bow the paper in opposite directions. Folding it from top to bottom has a little more resistance that it does from the left and right sides. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Point being if you are making cuts it is that second cut that will be an issue. If you can make it so the second cut is the one that cross the grain of the paper it is less likely to tear off. Holding the paper behind the cut can also help mitigate this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I cut out a lot of names printed from fancy fonts and this happens to me as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="44" LastEditorUserId="29" LastEditDate="2016-04-29T02:11:18.350" LastActivityDate="2016-04-29T02:11:18.350" CommentCount="4" />

A good friend of mine hates metal needles because they are cold and it hurts her fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But all of this does not really matter.  A beginner needs to begin, so, a beginner will get a ball of yarn, and read the label to know what size of needles he needs for this.

In the context of painting, the word ‘canvas’ means a fabric used as a painting surface. The difference is that sometimes the canvas is made from cotton fibres and other times from linen fibres. Each material is worth looking at in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;Cotton&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cotton is a soft, fluffy fibers that grows in a boll or protective capsule around the seeds of cotton plants. The plant is native to the Americas, Africa and India and is most often spun into yarn or thread to create a soft, breathable textile - the chances are you are wearing some cotton right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The advantage of cotton to you as an artist is that it is affordable and it stretches very easily. A properly prepared cotton canvas will last a long time and is the most popular surface for oil and acrylic painting, especially for students, although it is considered too flexible for very large paintings. It is classified according to its weight and surface texture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to tightness, cotton comes out on top. It is possible to stretch cotton tighter than linen without straining the wooden support around the canvas, and a heavy-grade cotton can make up for its lack of strength and weight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;Linen&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Linen is strong and durable, and remains the preferred surface for many artists but it is expensive. It is made from the fibers of the flax plant and top quality flax is harvested mainly in Western Europe. If you want your painting to last then a linen canvas is a sound investment. The threads that make up linen, known as the warp and weft threads, weigh the same, which means they are less prone to expansion or contraction due to moisture. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Linen retains its natural oils, which helps to preserve the fibre’s flexibility and stops the canvas from going brittle. It is also regarded as having a more ‘natural’ weaved finish than cotton – a variety of textures and weights are available in both rough and smooth finishes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Because of its strength linen holds up to a heavy painting hand and does not become slack as easily as cotton canvas.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="90" LastEditorUserId="84" LastEditDate="2016-04-27T10:54:49.163" LastActivityDate="2016-04-27T10:54:49.163" CommentCount="0" />

Later, when paper was invented, people realized&#xA;  that this material was easy to cut, store and discard. Thus paper&#xA;  became the major material for them to use, and people habitually&#xA;  called this artistry paper-cutting, or Jianzhi in Chinese.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_paper_cutting&quot;&gt;Jewish paper cutting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Jewish paper cutting is a traditional form of Jewish folk art made by&#xA;  cutting figures and sentences in paper or parchment.

Make sure your Play-Doh sculpture is stable, and place it on a sheet of aluminum foil on top of a cookie sheet or something comparable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bake the sculpture for 10&amp;ndash;15 minutes. If you have thicker parts on the sculpture, you'll have to bake for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend making some test sculpture, like simple tubes, of different thicknesses. By baking these, you can test out how long it takes in your particular oven. You can test if the bake was long enough by breaking the test tube in half and making sure the moisture is gone from the center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After it's baked, you'll need to apply a varnish to seal the sculpture. You'll want a product that's water proof, and most will do that. Avoid spray varnishes, because the propellant chemicals may affect the sculpture over time. There are varnishes specifically for sculptures, but some people have had success with sculpture by using clear wood finishes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you apply the varnish, make sure you get every spot. Use a fine brush to get into crevices. After the first coat dries, go back over to get the bottom of the sculpture and wherever you held it. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that should do it. Of course, I would test it with a lump, first, to make sure the varnish you're using doesn't result in a sticky texture or soften the Play-Doh as you apply it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24" LastEditorUserId="29" LastEditDate="2016-04-27T16:11:43.267" LastActivityDate="2016-04-27T16:11:43.267" CommentCount="2" />

Use standard perspective technique, connecting points on your shape to the relevant VP. Make sure you draw the hidden part of the object (the back), because that can affect the shadow shape.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Assign a place for your Light Source. This is up to up. The horizontal distance from your object will determine the rotation of the shadow. The vertical distance from the horizon will affect the length of the shadow, with greater distance shortening shadows (just like at high noon). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From your light source, draw Shadow Perspective Lines to the top vertex points of your shape.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From your Horizon Light Point (AKA light vanishing point) draw the Shadow Perspective Lines connecting to the bottom points corresponding to the points from step 4.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Find the intersection of the SPLs from vertexes connected by common edges.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Connect these SPL intersections. They are the boundaries of your shadow.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Connect the remaning SPL intersections to the ground-level vertex of the object by following your SPL to the horizon light vanishing point. (Usually, you don't have to think about it and just connected it to the logical corner.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shade in between those boundaries you just made.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things get more complicated as your shape gets more complicated, is not resting on the ground, or has curves. The guide I linked to earlier has information on casting shadows from the air, and onto other objects instead of the ground. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can cast shadows of curved objects by creating a shadow map of the box you could draw around your perspective object. &lt;a href=&quot;http://thevirtualinstructor.com/how-to-draw-paint-cast-shadows.html&quot;&gt;The Virtual Instructor&lt;/a&gt; has some examples of shadows of circular and spherical objects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information, you'll want to find resources regarding drawing in perspective, and especially shadows in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Multiple light sources and ambient light will further complicate your drawing.

Where possible, you should light your work with dedicated lamps using daylight balanced light bulbs with a color temperature in and around 5500K. The packaging should specify the color temperature, which is more reliable than if it merely says daylight on the package, so avoid those that don't or that claim a temperature way off that number. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really recommend getting some decent swing-arm desk lamps and LED bulbs.

Lean paint is paint that is diluted with white-spirit or turpentine. It is 'watery', and dries quickly. Typically underpaintings are done in this way, as it's quick and easy to correct mistakes. As you then build up subsequent layers, use less spirits and more medium (typically linseed oil) - the oil being the 'fat'. These layers dry more slowly as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doing this ensures that the lower layers dry more quickly than the upper layers. Cracking happens when the top layers dry first, then the lower layers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some other considerations: cheaper paint will have more varied drying time between different colours.

It is small enough to not take too much effort. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Notes on mass production&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As per the comments it looks like you are going to try and mass produce these. I still think sanding would be safer but I suppose you could use a disk sander to speed up the process. Just keep in mind that it is still a power tool that can hurt you so always be mindful of that. Don't sacrifice in an attempt to increase efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would consider making a small ramp of jig that would give you a 60 degree angle. Looking at an edge view from the wiki that can help ensure the best angles when sanding. You can try and use a set of small squeeze clamps to help keep your fingers out of harms way. Those might become less useful as you form your cube since the sides will be made smaller and there will be less to grip. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Perhaps this product already exists if you are interested&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do need that many I would look to see if someone already has these machined and sells them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/237121215/100pcs-natural-polyhedron-faceted-cube&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I found this seller on Etsy that makes what appears to be the correct polyhedral&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/215501287/geometric-wooden-beads-natural-20mm-pack?ref=market&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This one as well&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/BG7xqm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/BG7xqm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something like a bead supplier could have these and they could likely be finished as well with varnish too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Woodworking.SE&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do nail down a process/procedure based on tools available but still need more help consider coming over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;woodworking.se&lt;/a&gt; and asking there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="44" LastEditorUserId="44" LastEditDate="2016-04-28T12:53:30.803" LastActivityDate="2016-04-28T12:53:30.803" CommentCount="2" />

Next, pass the needle partway through the good side of the other piece of cloth at the closest location where the pieces meet. Don't pull the thread too tightly; you'll need space to perform the next step. Now that the tip of your needle is on the inside of the plushie, pass it through to the outside and pull the whole needle out. Repeat. Remember to pull the earlier stitches tight at some point, once you don't need the wiggle room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one, when pulled taut, closes neatly, holding the two halves pretty much flush with each other and looking very neat, but it isn't quite as strong as the latter, and when mistreated, it will just pull apart, revealing the needlework, crumpling the cloth laterally, and losing the whole appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://stardustshoes.blogspot.com/2009/04/baseball-stitch.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Baseball Stitch&lt;/a&gt; - same as on a baseball ball, except pulled taut such that it forces the material to fold and crumple, is much stronger, but when pulled taut, the sides don't form such a neat, flush connection, but form a shallow groove, and the needlework may be visible if one peers into it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/W5UEe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/W5UEe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just push the needle from the inner side of the material onto the outer, and cross to the other side, repeating, inner to outer.

It requires much more force to break and doesn't crumple the visible surface of the cloth when strained, but if it does come apart somewhat, due to abuse, the needlework will show more, and even perfectly new it will form a deeper and more visible groove than the Ladder stitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me add that in your situation, where you're repairing items that were already subjected to abuse and likely will continue to, the baseball stitch is a better choice, as despite worse initial appearance, it doesn't degrade nearly as much when abused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="163" LastEditorUserId="163" LastEditDate="2016-04-29T17:03:35.153" LastActivityDate="2016-04-29T17:03:35.153" CommentCount="1" />

Charcoal, due to its brittle nature is also easy to smudge or gently wipe to assist in your shading efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Charcoal artwork needs to be treated after you're finished with the work as the particles (essentially dust) will fall from the artwork over time and may either leave dark streaks on the artwork or just cause the art to fade as the particles fall over the art or off of it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Graphite is a slightly harder to shade with, and doesn't usually get as dark as charcoal. Some of the darker graphites, like an 8B, tend to look glossy and reflective when used over large areas. This is something charcoal does not do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Graphite can be easily shaded with the help of tortilons, though, and varying pressure in combination with pencil grades can give you a very wide range of shades to work with. Graphite also lasts on the paper without particles falling off and can remain in-tact for years as long as its not being touched or rubbed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The paper you use plays a big role on the art itself. Some papers, like newsprint are great for quick charcoal sketching and practice. Charcoal easily wipes from newsprint and it's cheap, while graphite is hardly visible. Higher quality papers are less forgiving of errors, but the finished product will look nicer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="95" LastActivityDate="2016-04-29T14:12:49.080" CommentCount="0" />

This grip makes it easier to apply lighter strokes to your piece. &lt;strong&gt;If your shading method requires you to apply strokes of different pressure, this grip may help you more.&lt;/strong&gt; Building up your values one &quot;layer&quot; of shading at a time is a very common method, used with or without the aid of blending. &lt;strong&gt;The standard grip makes it easy to press too hard, often making the brush grip a better choice for building up value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can combine the pressure control with any of the methods you listed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/HgHnP.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/HgHnP.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/iXJRKm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/iXJRKm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Underhand grip&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I call this one underhand, but I've seen it called violin bow grip and also drumstick grip. Basically, you hold the pencil between the tips of your thumb and index finger, but your palm faces up (see picture). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chiseledrocks.com/main/musings/topics/how_to_hold_the_pencil&quot;&gt;The site I used for the picture&lt;/a&gt; already has a great explanation of what kinds of shading this is used for:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This grip is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; preferable basic drawing grip. It does not need a propped arm, and the motion range is limited only by your arm span; it produces flowing, economical sweeping line and is ideal for rough sketching, &lt;strong&gt;hatching and tonal work with the side of lead&lt;/strong&gt;. It works best on big page and a near-vertical plane (paper pinned to board), and is the preferred grip in academic drawing. It enables working with the lead’s side, for darker flowing lines and shading. It cannot be used with Wacom stylus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This really is the best grip for using the side of the lead, especially when you're using a properly-sharpened pencil. &lt;em&gt;Using the side of the lead allows you to lay down varying widths of solid tone. That makes this grip ideal for certain types of blending.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This grip also allows you to make fairly detailed hatch/crosshatch marks, although not as detailed as the standard grip. Generally, when you use this grip you keep your wrist stiff and move the pencil with your shoulder and elbow. However, you can flick your wrist to get some consistent, finely detailed lines. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The downside of this grip hinted at in the quote: you can't use it when drawing on a horizontal surface. You need an incline and room for your elbow to move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'd find it pretty hard to do detailed work with this grip, or do any sort of stippling/dotting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/VXonC.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/VXonC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Other grips&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other grips out there, but the point here isn't to list the pros and cons of them all.

Special techniques like the ones you mentioned are required for pen and ink projects because pens don't naturally provide a way to fade from light to dark the way graphite does. Since an area is either black or white when using a pen, special techniques are used to demonstrate the illusion of shade when in fact it's all jet black or stark white.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LC5ID.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LC5ID.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pencil Shading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for shading with a pencil, I find the sharpness of the edge to be more important than the angle of the stroke. If you are using a freshly sharpened pencil you'll likely wind up with dark hard lines. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using a rounded or dull tip allows you to shade more evenly and smoothly without the need to hold the pencil at an angle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have softer strokes (from using a rounded or dull pencil), they can easily be blended together with a tortillon. A tortillon is rolled paper, designed to help smooth the strokes of a pencil and improve the smoothness of your shading.

If you regularly draw on a horizontal surface, you'll spend a lot of time with your head down. This is terrible for your neck! It can lead to sore, tight muscles. Or, if you have neck problems (like I do), it can be downright painful to even try to draw like that for any length of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having the desk at an incline allows you to have a better vantage point of your work. You can more or less have your eyes even with the center of the work piece. This means you're less likely to distort your drawing with perspective problems. When you're head down on a flat surface, your visual focal point is generally aligned to a single spot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand what I mean, take a look at this sidewalk chalk art.&#xA;This is how it actually looks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/RUNxkm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/RUNxkm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is how it looks from a specific vantage point:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/QzGPym.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/QzGPym.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of drawing on a flat plane, you may end up drawing a distorted, stretched out image, but your mind perceives it as perfectly proportional. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can avoid that by using measurements and taking breaks to look at the piece from different angles, but it's a little more work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Drawing grip&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me, this can be the biggest advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having an inclined plane allows you to use an underhand or paint brush grip with ease.

These grips, and your lines, will have a more natural and relaxed feel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, these grips aren't necessarily a benefit for all types of drawing.

Even with a lot of &quot;extra&quot; stitches in each row you should be able to eventually create a flat piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't made snowflakes in years so I don't remember the exact process but if I were to do one today I would probably do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wet the finished piece with water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On an ironing board (because the cover/padding is soft) I would lay the damp (or wet, doesn't matter) piece out as flat as I could and then using straight sewing pins I would start stretching and &quot;anchoring&quot; all the the edges by poking the pins down into the ironing board padding. If you have a fancy ironing board cover you might want to rethink making pin holes in it but a fabric cover is okay.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once your piece is stretched out and evenly anchored with pins let it air dry (it should hold its shape).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get your iron and turn it on to a heat setting appropriate for the type of yarn/thread you used, hopefully your thread can tolerate at least the lowest steam setting. You will be pressing the snowflake &lt;em&gt;before starching&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Now with your iron heated up (and hopefully steaming) carefully remove the pins &lt;em&gt;from one point only&lt;/em&gt; of the snowflake and gently press the iron onto that point. You might want to use a thin cloth or pressing cloth between the iron and the snowflake.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repeat for all of the snowflake points and gently press with the iron. You should now have a nice flat snowflake. Allow it to fully cool.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is point where you mix the starch. If I recall I used &lt;em&gt;Lacy's Stiff Stuff&lt;/em&gt; (available at U.S. craft stores). I would think that &lt;em&gt;Mod Podge&lt;/em&gt; could also be used but I haven't tried that. The consistency should be just thin enough to soak into the fiber without gooping up on the surface. You want it to be able to penetrate but not puddle too much underneath.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Carefully place the flattened, cooled snowflake on a piece of waxed or parchment paper and carefully apply the stiffener/starch with a craft brush, allowing the starch to soak into the fibers of the snowflake. Get as much stiffener as you can to soak in without it pooling underneath.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While the stiffener is still wet I like to add a bit of superfine iridescent glitter because I'm crafty. Allow the snowflake to fully dry.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Carefully peel the snowflake from the waxed paper and admire your handiwork!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's just one way to do it. As I was typing I realized that you could skip the ironing step entirely and just soak the newly-crocheted piece in the stiffener until it is saturated then place it on the waxed paper and &quot;coax&quot; it into shape as it dries with your fingers and/or pins as above. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you use waxed (or parchment) paper between the snowflake and the ironing board (or other pinnable surface) if you're using pins. Let it dry fully and you have the same result. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have used both methods.

Make sure you like and understand how this process works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Needle threading - most modern machines have a light near the needle to make this easier.  But also - how do you thread the machine - it's always more than sticking the thread in the eye of the needle.  If learning to thread the machine makes you want to cry, this is not the machine for you.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bobbin winding and needle threading are steps you'll do almost every time you sew (sometimes more than that!) so if you hate the steps or find them really hard, it's worth it to keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly - every machine will have a presser foot and a way of lifting/dropping the needle - there's no right or wrong, but it's a comfort issue... like going on a test drive of a car.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Quality checks when buying&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure you can sew with the machine.

All of these can have their own downsides but they're worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that, realistically, if you can't tell whether something is &quot;sport&quot; or &quot;DK&quot; but you know it's one of the two, it's probably not going to throw you off too badly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that the US and the UK have different terms for the same weights of yarn but that since stores sell yarn from around the world, you're likely to run into all of them regardless of where you live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Wrapping&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/11/determining-yarn-weights/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wrapping&lt;/a&gt; is a method of testing the weight by seeing how many widths of yarn fit in an inch of space. It looks a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/MqbZB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/MqbZB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wrapping to measure yarn weight&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can wrap around the ruler itself or around something else like a pencil. The fewer widths of yarn that fit in an inch, the heavier the yarn is. Note that for thicker yarns, you might want to wrap more than an inch and divide to get a better count.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The downside of this is that not everyone wraps the same and yarn is squishy. They yarn in the image is very neatly wrapped but you could easily squash it together and get another 3-4 wraps in that inch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Ply or strands&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generally&lt;/em&gt; heavier-weight yarns have more strands. This can be finicky with smaller weight yarns and it won't always give you the information you need because there's no real standard but if your yarn only has 2-3 strands, it's probably really light weight and if it's worsted it's probably 10 or 12 ply. So, if you use this in combination with wrapping (or some common sense) it will probably help you. There's a list of the ply to weight name chart on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ravelry.com/help/yarn/weights&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ravelry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;By Gauge&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can determine whether an unknown ball of yarn will work for your project by making a gauge swatch. This requires that you are pretty comfortable with your stitching and are consistent but it should help. Use the recommended sized hook or needle for the project and follow the instructions for determining gauge for the project (if it includes those instructions) or use a base guide like the one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craftyarncouncil.com/weight.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If the stitch count per four inch swatch is really off, then it won't work. If it's good and it looks the way you expect, then go for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, you should adjust for your own stitch style. If you know that you normally need to crochet with a 5.5 mm hook when the recommended size is 6.5, then crochet the sample with the 5.5 mm hook rather than the recommended one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;By Weight&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people have really good scales. If you measure how long your yarn is and then weigh it (in grams) you should be able to find out the weight... because everyone wants to spend hours measuring the length of their yarn. The better your scale is (and heavier the weight), the shorter the length of yarn you can weigh. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend that you weigh at least 10-20 grams worth of yarn and then figure out the length. Note that you don't have to cut the yarn to do this, just let the remainder hang off the scale and mark the measurement stop point with a small slip knot. It shouldn't affect the measurement too much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have your weight to length measurement, you should be able to compare it to other known yarns and get an idea of what the &quot;weight&quot; group is. Though, note that the material your yarn is made of can affect its density so if you don't know what it's made of (which is likely since you don't have the label any more), you might want to try to &lt;a href=&quot;http://crafts.stackexchange.com/questions/170/is-there-a-way-to-determine-the-fiber-content-of-a-yarn-if-ive-lost-the-label&quot;&gt;figure that out&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, labels are annoying to hold on to plus the cat probably ran off with them or ate them... but I recommend that you avoid getting into this situation by logging your yarn purchases somewhere. Either keep track of your receipts (if they give identifying info about the yarn) or, even better, track your purchases on a site like Ravelry. This is great because it often has everything uploaded already, so you don't have to manually enter any of the data except (if you want) color name and dye lot.

You want to be sure that the nibs / cartridge nibs are free of rust before you go to store them. This is especially true if you intend to store your nibs together in close proximity. Enough rust will render the nib useless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baking Soda Paste&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For simple surface rust you can make a paste from baking soda and water and use a toothbrush to gently work the surface to remove the rust. Again, using water to clean the surface one done. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are more tactics to removing rust, like vinegar or a molasses bath, but given that there are hard to restore if the rust is bad you should only have to worry about simple surface rust. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Storage&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One area where people seem a little divided is on storage of nibs. Particularity when it comes to storing nibs together where they can touch or completely segregated from each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Storage options are numerous. Some styles worth mentioning&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Simple tins cans (think Altoids)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Small plastic containers. These are favoured as you can store the nibs vertically. This is done, in theory, to prevent ink build up on the split and tip. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tackle box / craft box. Any partitioned storage box really. Multiple nibs that are related to each other are stored together. Since the partitions are configurable or at least different sizes your cartridges would fit in here as well as your pens. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cardboard. If you like keeping the nibs separate then this would be a preferred method as each nib would get its own slot. As long as you can keep the board itself in a safe location this also prevents the nibs from moving around which could damage the tips.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other storage considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cut up small straw lengths that you can either feed down the split (If you have to force it don't do it.) or place on the tip for additional protection. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Silica gel packets: You save these right? If humidity is an issue for your storage then consider sticking in one or two of these in with your nibs. It will help keep a moisture, and therefore rust, free environment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your are fine with storing nibs together make sure at least they cannot come into contact with anything heavier or harder than themselves. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="44" LastEditorUserId="44" LastEditDate="2016-05-04T12:18:10.363" LastActivityDate="2016-05-04T12:18:10.363" CommentCount="0" />

To remove the bubbles from gesso that you’ve just laid take a&#xA;  pin and gently pop them before it begins to dry.  It has been my&#xA;  experience that the key to beautiful raised gilding is an even surface&#xA;  tension to the &quot;bubble&quot; of gesso that you lay down.  To create an even&#xA;  surface tension to your gesso you should first drop a large puddle of&#xA;  the gesso into the space you will be gilding, then using your brush&#xA;  pull the edges of the puddle outwards to the fill your designed space.&#xA;  This gesso is not designed for flat gilding and your design should be&#xA;  filled in with puddles of the gesso that create small domes on your&#xA;  page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.insightbb.com/~denevell_books/gilding.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Scribal Art of Elizabth de Nevell&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="197" LastActivityDate="2016-05-04T17:45:26.623" CommentCount="0" />

I actually have &quot;jump ring mandrels&quot; that fit into the chuck of a drill so I can wind massive amounts of wire if I want to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Slowest Way:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm currently making rings from some wire spool ends and I'm cutting them by hand using flush cut pliers. I just snip the rings one at a time from the coil then turn the cutters and nip the non-flat part of the cut with the flat edge of the flush-cutters. Depending on how much wire you nip off where the ends join it can change the size/shape of your ring overall so this is only good for scraps and if you need a few rings. An important note is to make sure your cutting pliers can handle the thickness/gauge of the wire you are cutting. I broke cutters and sent the broken blade careening toward my eyeball, hence the eye protection warning. I was wearing glasses and yes, they got chipped.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Slow Way:&lt;/strong&gt; I was at a glass and jewelry show and met a nice couple that made their own rings but hand-cut them with a jeweler's saw. This is a small saw frame that takes super-thin blades. If I recall I was told to use some of the smallest blades available (8/0 I believe). They suggested holding the coil in one hand while wearing heavy leather gloves. There are much better ways of holding the coil if cutting by hand, one of them involves using a jeweler's bench pin, but you might still want to wear heavy gloves. There is also something called &quot;coil cutting pliers&quot; that are made and sold by BeadSmith. They're meant to be used with a jeweler's saw as well. I have these pliers but haven't tried them yet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fast Way:&lt;/strong&gt; (My expertise is running out here) There are some wonderful systems out there that have an apparatus to wind the wire, hold the wire, and then have an attachment that fits on a rotary tool (like a Dremel) or a regular drill with a cutting blade. I believe the names are &quot;Jump Ringer&quot; and &quot;Koil Kutter&quot;. I'm sure there are others by now. They are rather expensive, at least a couple hundred dollars, but can't be beat for large volumes of rings. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also bears mentioning that with any cutting method used there might be little burrs at the wire ends where they were cut. If you don't want little burr ends catching and snagging on skin, clothing, etc., you probably need to file all those little rough ends or tumble polish the rings to smooth them out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not a jump ring expert but I've made a lot of jump rings by hand (and I still do) and I've finished a few maille pieces. I might have missed something and hope someone can add to what I've mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="192" LastEditorUserId="24" LastEditDate="2016-05-05T02:16:37.067" LastActivityDate="2016-05-05T02:16:37.067" CommentCount="3" />

  <row Id="377" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="376" CreationDate="2016-05-07T13:04:07.480" Score="15" Body="&lt;p&gt;One of the most common techniques to avoid this problem is using an extra sheet of paper. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Place the paper so it's under your drawing hand and on top of the part of your drawing you're not working on. Be careful not to move it around too much, using masking tape to stick it to your desk if necessary. If you use tracing paper, you'll still be able to see where you're headed through the sheet, instead of blocking off your view of the piece as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also start to build up your hand control. The smudging happens, generally, because your drawing hand is resting completely on the paper. On a horizontal desk, this in natural, but leads to smudging. Instead of resting your hand on its whole side, try using one of your pinky knuckles as a the only place your hand touches the page. This will minimize contact with the paper and reduce the chance of smearing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're on an inclined desk or easel, you can change to an alternative drawing grip. The underhand grip, for instance, should keep your hand completely off the page. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I'd suggest just being careful about watching your hands. Making sure your drawing hand isn't making contact with the paper where you've already drawn while you're drawing, and that your free hand isn't gripping the page on the penciled parts. Change your paper or hand angle as necessary to do this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A note, pencils in the B range are softer and will smudge more and more obviously, so be extra careful with them. 4H and higher shouldn't smear very much at all, but they give you much lighter values. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you meant the smudge after you finish them, I would recommend you purchase some fixative spray. It can be used for graphite, charcoal and pastel. Essentially, it adds a protective layer over the piece. There's also fixatives to use while working on them. I have no idea about these, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/380/24&quot;&gt;John Cavan does&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aerosol hair spray does the same in a pinch, but will damage your work over the long term. However, if you're just going to scan it or take a picture of it, you may not care.

  <row Id="381" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="364" CreationDate="2016-05-07T17:39:28.237" Score="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;-Note-: I started this answer before there was mention of potential of varnish on the table. This answer would hold outside of that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While you can usually epoxy over almost anything if you already have a varnished surface you might not need to bother. &quot;Varnish&quot; a little vague so it would be hard to be exactly sure. I would like to think the artist is aware of this so it should not be an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think one of the better choices here would be epoxy resin. You could also call it a bar-top finish. They are essentially the same thing. I had some initial hesitation in offering this suggestion until I saw multiple artists used epoxy resin to give a glass finish to their own acrylic paintings. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPEbPgE7RGAS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;One such example&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are meant for strength and longevity. However they are more susceptible to sunlight and UV rays then other finishes. You see this in other crafts as well like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=penny%20table&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;penny tables&lt;/a&gt;. Epoxy resin is usually food safe once fully cured check your individual product information to be sure. . &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have never done this before this should not be your first large project with epoxy resin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to work in an area that would be relatively free of dust and debris. Epoxies come as two liquids that need to be mixed together: a resin and a hardener. Most require a mix of 1:1.  Hard to say exactly how much you would need to cover your entire surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can remove the legs off your table I would do that and then use some small blocks or other objects to prop the table off the ground. Epoxy resin is self leveling so &lt;em&gt;it is imperative&lt;/em&gt; that you ensure your table is level before application. Use a level or series of level to help ensure that. At the same time you need to put down something under the table so that the resin has something to drip onto. This is supposed to happen to ensure an even finish. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mix/stir your epoxy resin and pour over the table. You can use a brush to help the resin get around the whole surface. You are not &quot;painting&quot; the surface but helping the resin get complete coverage. Again, it will drip over the edges and that is fine as it helps coat the edges. You have a few minutes so if you need to add more resin to your surface you have a small window to add more without harming it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bubbles are bound to happen so have a blow torch or heat gun handy to help pop them before the resin starts to cure. I even heard breathing (not blowing) on them helps them pop. This can especially be an issue for a mixed media table as there will be plenty of places for air to hide. Make sure that whatever you are using that you don't want near surface contact and stay in motion. You don't want to burn it or cause wrinkles if the epoxy is starting to cure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can sometimes thin your epoxy to give it a longer curing time which both allows it to seep better and gives you more time. Note this can affect its overall strength. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have your surface coated and bubbles removed then you typically would leave it to cure over a couple of days to be sure. If you have the means to tent the table this will help keep dust off. Be sure whatever you do that there is no risk of the blankets or what not falling onto the table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Epoxy resins can be a complex subject if you want them to be. There is a lot of scenarios that would be too hard to cover hear. Do you research and always pay attention to product labels. So, if you are curious about this I would recommend reading up on it more. If you wanted to explore this in more detail I would recommend asking specific questions about your particular quandary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artresin.com/pages/how-to-videos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Art-Resin has some starting videos on the subject.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="44" LastActivityDate="2016-05-07T17:39:28.237" CommentCount="0" />

A stick with a ball of leather or rubber is a mahl stick. For the right-hander, the stick is held in the left, the ball is placed at upper right, either on the work surface or edge of easel. Some artists use a leather thong or nail to secure. You now have a movable bridge to keep your hand off the work surface. I use a yardstick with a ball of rags and tape at one end. You can easily make different lengths based on the scale you work at. Side note: see John Cusack demonstrate the use of a mini mahl stick in &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. Try a wooden dowel with a tennis ball or solid rubber ball at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, there is the issue of oils on the hand. To battle this use thin cotton gloves to handle paper. You used to be able to get these at photo supply stores. Cut all fingers off but the pinky for drawing hand. Again, this really just depends on how much you care about preservation of the white of the paper. For illustrators this is huge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I add the following for thoroughness and the OCD tendencies in some of us.

I leave that as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For simplicity and ease of use, the extra piece of paper suggestions are great. Just adding my 2 cents for completeness.

Some sites don't seem to be bothered by fraying and recommend simply cutting the strings off afterwards but this seems like a great way to get your fabric tied up in knots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.madeeveryday.com/2012/05/ask-dana-prewashing-fabrics-and-overwhelmed-with-projects.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;guide notes&lt;/a&gt; to consider the weave tightness:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;First, remember that fabrics will fray depending on how tightly they are woven.  Loosely woven fabrics like Linen and some cottons can fray a 1/2 inch or so.  But some cottons and polyesters with a tighter weave might only frizz out on the ends.  And knit fabrics won’t fray at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other common notes are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;wash the fabric in large pieces rather than small ones as the small pieces can be sucked into the machine's agitator &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;wash the fabric in the same method you plan to wash the garment - so (as an example) if you're planning to dry clean your wool, dry clean the fabric rather than machine washing it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a note, with all methods, your results may vary.

This was also LQS type fabric. I tried the pinking shears trick and it didn't stop the fraying. I've also sewed along the edges prior to washing but it still frayed. Some fabrics don't fray at all and then some others I will loose at least an inch off the total cut. I ALWAYS was in cold on a delicate cycle and only put in the dryer until damp them iron. sorry, I don't have any positive answers for you!! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MaryAnnMc&lt;/strong&gt;: I agree, everything I've tried still frays.

When I wash fabric, I open it all the way up. I find that some manufacturers don't get it rolled on the bolt completely straight. So, I open it up completely, wash and dry it, refold it so there are no diagonal waves when held selvage to selvage, (I usually lose 1-2 inches here - but it has been as much as 3.) Then I trim it with the rotary cutter and iron it and it gets either used then or stashed for future use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bearisgray&lt;/strong&gt;: I finally learned to either serge the raw edge or overcast the raw edge with a long, narrow zigzag stitch before washing.

There are different styles and features, but all will have a cutting wheel. There are different grips, ones with multiple rotating cutters and many have a ball or similar on the opposite end of the tool (Which is used for tapping the glass)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Prepping your work surface&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should, in general, be cutting glass on a hard surface that is clean of debris. While you might be tempted to cut on carpet or softer surface, this would be counter productive. The pressure you exert with the tool on the glass is the most important factor, so you don't want the glass to move at all unless by your own hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tool, when used properly, will come into contact with this surface so if you have something hard like a metal top, then you might want to put something down like thin cardboard or a self healing mat so as to not damage your cutter prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clean glass debris between your breaks. It does not take much to scratch. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Scoring the glass&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Glass cutting with hand tools relies on scoring the glass. You are placing a shallow cut/fissure into the glass to guide the eventual break. Getting the perfect score &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be difficult to get perfect, but following some basic guidelines, it can be done. If your tool is not self lubricating then you should make sure you lubricate the wheel. This will prevent it from getting locked up with glass shards and binding. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You want the score to be deep enough that it cuts into the glass but not so deep that it starts throwing off chips. The sound the glass is making while your a cutting is important. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAlrlFyEAt4&amp;amp;t=4m29s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It should sound like a light zipper&lt;/a&gt; and the sound should be continuous from the start to the finish of the cut. Always start and end the score off the glass and avoid hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Break the glass&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have a good score line you should be able to break the glass with ease. These are general approaches&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Score away from the edge of the glass&lt;/strong&gt;: Most cuts you should be able to do with your hand as long as there is room. Place your thumbs close on both sides of the score line. Start applying leverage like you want to bend it in half. Much in the same way you break a chocolate bar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Score near the edge&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are having issues getting a hold with your hand then you can use glass pliers or running pliers. Basically pliers with curved jaws with a rubber-like covering to protect the glass. The curved jaws work the glass the same as your hands, using the score line like a fulcrum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freepatternsforstainedglass.com/running-pliers.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/TOtc6m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Running Pliers on glass&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Image from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freepatternsforstainedglass.com/running-pliers.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;freepatternsforstainedglass.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other variations of hand and tool positions exist. It's a matter of applying pressure close to the score line to encourage a break. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are having issues getting the break to start you might not have a good score line, the glass might be thick, or you might need to exert more pressure to start the break. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use the ball of the cutter to tap near the score line &lt;em&gt;on the other side&lt;/em&gt;. Run the ball at the edge of the glass and follow the score line along. You likely can see the glass start to break when it gets easier to see. Once that is done you can come back to hands or pliers and try to break again. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your score is weak &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; try to score on the same line again. It can damage the tool and will create an unpredictable breaking score line. Instead try scoring again on the other side of the glass. While this still could have problems, it is a better 2nd chance approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of several good videos that covers this and similar topic &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAlrlFyEAt4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAlrlFyEAt4&amp;amp;t=4m29s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;listen to the sound the glass makes when scoring properly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="44" LastEditorUserId="47" LastEditDate="2016-05-14T18:00:21.790" LastActivityDate="2016-05-14T18:00:21.790" CommentCount="1" />

This means you can form points, lines, and a variety of other erasing surfaces with it. This allows you to easily erase just the place you want. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it doesn't erase the same way as your rubber or Mars plastic (polymer) erasers, which leave bits behind and may wear down you paper. It actually lifts up your graphite or charcoal marks. This means you don't have to brush or blow the residue away. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This property also allows you to only partially erase something. For instance, you may have placed a large swath of grey that's a couple shades too dark. You can pat at the dark area to lighten it, instead of erasing it and starting over. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have tried and own eraser shields, but they don't work very well with erasers that have lost their edges. When I do use them, it's with my kneaded erasers and not my polymer erasers. In that case, they work very well as stencils for the point you knead. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the points, you need to roll them thick and shallow instead of thin and steep, in order to have enough strength in the tip to hold up. I generally just make a ball, pinch part, and make a cone out of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unless you want to erase very finely, such as adding highlights to hair. In that case, you can leave the point long and thin, and it will gently lift up fine lines of pencil. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you start using kneaded erasers, you'll find that they're really an entirely new implement, quite unlike regular erasers. Since you can adjust the amount you erase by changing pressure and eraser shape and even the &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; you apply pressure (standard erasing motion, patting, rolling, stippling!), you can get very fine control over what you're doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And you don't have to worry about erasing holes in your paper! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, kneaded erasers have downsides. The harder your lead (4H and up), the less effective I find these. Likewise, the harder you press with your pencil, the less effective they are, because they can't pick up the graphite dust. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the kneaded eraser won't do it, use a polymer eraser (I throw out rubber erasers). You can always use a craft knife to &quot;sharpen&quot; them into a point or chisel. Sharpening polymer erasers makes them work much better with eraser shields, too! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24" LastEditorUserId="17" LastEditDate="2016-05-17T16:05:00.680" LastActivityDate="2016-05-17T16:05:00.680" CommentCount="1" />

The vast majority of fountain pen inks actually use the same commercial dyes that are used on cloth—I think only a handful of brands mix their own (J. Herbin, Noodlers, Private Reserve). So, you could probably just leave the ink uncovered for a while to get some of the water to evaporate which will concentrate the dye.

It can be sewn with 2-5 threads, but the most basic uses either 3 or 4. It is called an overlock stitch because the threads are cast over the raw edge of the fabric, locking it into a finish that won’t unravel or fray. When using a serger for basic overlocking, you can sew even when there is not fabric under the needles. This is called “chaining”. It makes it really easy, because you can put your foot on the pedal and start serging, feed the fabric through to create your seam, and then chain right off the end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fashion-incubator.com/flatlocking-compared-to-cover-stitching-and-overlocking/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fashion Incubator&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a coverstitch machine does less than a serger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't gotten into buying a serger yet, but my quick poking suggests that a serger can be a somewhat generic name - and it's worth it to learn exactly what stitches - overlock, cover stitch, and flatlock - it does.

There are several ways to refer to yarn weight, but the category, the number of plies, the number of wraps per inch and the gauge range (for both knitting and crocheting) are the most commonly used. The weight of your yarn will affect the size of your finished product, and the size of the needles or hook you will have the most ease to work with. You will always it on your skein package.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LouGj.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LouGj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Yarn label featuring category and gauge range&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are 8 categories of yarn as defined by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craftyarncouncil.com/&quot;&gt;Craft Yarn Council&lt;/a&gt;: Lace, Super Fine, Fine, Light, Medium, Bulky, Super Bulky and Jumbo. Each category refers to a specific range of the measurements methods. Some categories will sometimes be substituted for a type of yarn, like Worsted for Medium or DK (Double Knitting) for Light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The number of plies is nowadays probably the least consistent way to talk about yarn weight. Back in the day when knitting was done with actual sheep wool, yarn was measured by the number of single wool yarns in the finished yarn, but with synthetic yarn, it's more difficult to be consistent. For example, a 5 ply yarn in Australia will be called a 6 ply yarn in Germany, but not be standardized in the UK. Yarns below 5 ply are generally pretty consistent though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wraps per inch (wpi) is the the number of times you can fit a yarn within an inch. The thicker the yarn is, the lower its wpi will be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The gauge range is the number of stitches you can make in a 4 inch or 10 centimeter swatch. This measurement is always double, once for knitting and once for crocheting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a table I made:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/uJEQp.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/uJEQp.png&quot; alt=&quot;Yarn weight table&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastActivityDate="2016-05-17T16:09:32.257" CommentCount="0" />

The initial “screen” of hatching may be overlaid with subsequent series of lines drawn at contrasting angles, creating crosshatching&#xA;  and further darkening the value of the area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;... as well as what they can be used for in art:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The basic illusion of hatching is that a sequence of separate lines will read as a solid value from a slight distance. With hachure a draftsman can evoke a middle tone, a core or cast shadow or the atmosphere around a figure, as well as provide a means by which disparate elements of a drawing are unified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Objectives, techniques, and variations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thevirtualinstructor.com/hatchingcrosshatching.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This online tutorial&lt;/a&gt; with pictures and videos tells you some of the basic techniques and variations of the art of hatching and cross-hatching. I'll provide some of the most useful quotes for introductory guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hatching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Hatching is created when non-crossing lines are used to indicate the value on or around an object. The value added to the object is dependent on the location of a light source. &lt;strong&gt;More marks are added in the areas of core shadow and cast shadow, while less marks should exist in lighter areas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When hatching is used, &lt;strong&gt;the lines drawn generally go in the same direction and are mostly parallel with each other&lt;/strong&gt;. Sometimes, the lines may curve slightly or even a great bit depending on the contours of the object. Lines of this nature are referred to as cross contour lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When used correctly, cross contour lines can further the illusion of form by giving the viewer information about the actual 3-dimensional qualities of the object.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;By changing the frequency of the use of line, and the amount of space between the lines, the artist can create a full range of value in the drawing. Assuming that an artist is working on white paper, &lt;strong&gt;more space between the lines (more paper showing) will lead to lighter values in the drawing. Less space between lines will naturally lead to darker values in the drawing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross hatching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When cross hatching is used, the artist may begin adding value as hatching, but then allow the lines to cross over each other. &lt;strong&gt;The more that the lines cross over each other, the darker the value becomes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Many artists approach the addition of crossing lines as a science, following a &lt;strong&gt;specific order of vertical lines, followed by horizontal lines, followed by diagonal lines, and so on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This method produces very deliberate and controlled marks that are very exact and precise. Others simply cross the lines at random leading to “looser” drawings.&lt;/strong&gt; Neither way is better, per se. Some looser approaches work better for some subjects, while more rigid approaches are suitable for other subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a more visual way of learning how to do hatching and cross-hatching, there are various tutorial videos online.

For more delicate exposed tips, a layer of reinforcement or padding can be added to further reduce chance of breakage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are available commercially made:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ckzbg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ckzbg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dickblick.com/products/yasutomo-niji-roll&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Image from Blick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also find a number of tutorials online to make your own (or ask a crafty friend with a sewing machine to help you out):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/05LSr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/05LSr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lovemesew.co.uk/2013/09/27/how-to-make-a-coloured-pencil-roll/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Image from Love me Sew pencil roll tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="30" LastActivityDate="2016-05-18T11:32:38.883" CommentCount="5" />

Also, some rely on pressure exerted on the shaft of the pencil. The end fans out as you push it on the pencil. Keep a good grip but you could argue that it mars the shaft if you push too hard or too far. This is more an issue with the metal varieties but you could still get some compression on the plastic ones. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not all work like that though&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mochithings.com/products/5791&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/mHZNHm.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mochithings.com/products/5791&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mochithings.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not sure what those look like on the inside. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caps would be more beneficial if there was fewer pencils you were transporting / keeping at one time.

Using more yarn (more loops) will give you a more uniform/spherical appearance. If possible leave a small space between the tines of the fork and body of the fork. This makes the next step easier. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use a single strand of yarn and tie it around the loops. You can place it in-between the fork tines in order to get around the yarn loops. Make it tight. (You could also just use a pipe cleaner depending on how you plan to use them)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cut &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the loops out just the same. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can fluff up the end of the pompom by using something &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; a wire brush.

They will be shaped like a doughnut with pie slice removed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UgLNtm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UgLNtm.png&quot; alt=&quot;The discs&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place a small tail of yarn in between those discs. You will be using this to tie of later much in the same way as the other method above. This is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important part as this will be used to hold the whole pom together. You need to always be aware of where this string is during the process and not lose in inside the yarn wraps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your yarn is weak and prone to snapping under tension you should use something stronger. Wire work here as well if these will be part of a larger project. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UlNFem.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UlNFem.png&quot; alt=&quot;The center yarn&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting wrapping as much yarn as you deem necessary around the doughnut/circle. The more you use the tighter your pom will be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/x2ARjm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/x2ARjm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Start wrapping&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get scissors and cut the yarn in between the discs. Again, be aware of the location of the yarn tail so as to not cut it or lose it. You will have to hold the center of the discs to keep them together until you tie off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the tail and tie around the cut yarn. You should be able to remove the disc now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that the rest is the same. Fluff up the yarn to make your ball. Trim to get a more spherical shape. Use a brush if that effect is desired.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Disc Variation&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is at least one other variation to the cardboard disc method that uses specialized templates.

I wrote that original comment:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I sharpen my drawing pencils the &quot;proper&quot; way, with a knife.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was intending to be tongue-in-cheek, because you may find a lot of comments or tutorials online insisting that this is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; right way to sharpen a pencil. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think that it's the case, but I've now written a little tutorial about the &quot;proper&quot; way to sharpen a pencil, and also some pointers about sharpening pencils in general. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why use a knife?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using a knife to sharpen your pencil allows you to control the length and the shape of the exposed core. This, then, gives you more control over the types of strokes you'll be able to make. Longer points mean you can lay down wider lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A knife is very helpful for sharpening graphite, charcoal, and pastel pencils. These types of materials hold up to the process better, and wider lines are more likely to be sought from them. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/458/24&quot;&gt;John Cavan&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, colored pencils don't really hold up to the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What you'll need:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/sLbxHm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/sLbxHm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A sandpaper pad or block &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A pencil&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A very sharp knife&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A quick way to get rid of the shavings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The knife needs to be very sharp, because you don't want to apply much pressure to the pencil at all. The more pressure you have to apply, the more likely you are to break the exposed core &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; cause internal stress fractures that don't show up until much later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the knife is very sharp, please be careful. I prefer to use a utility knife, as shown, because the blades are sharp and easily replaceable when dull. I have used pocket knives before, but sharpening them is a whole other process. If you've never used a utility knife before, be aware that they generally come with spare blades inside them, so you don't have to buy extras right away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you've only just started sharpening pencils this way, &lt;strong&gt;please use cheap pencils&lt;/strong&gt;. It's very common to break pencils until you get the hang of this. Practice the technique on something you're fine with throwing away. That said, be aware that some cheaper pencils use really cheap wood, which may be harder or more prone to splitting. You generally won't have that problem with actual art pencils.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I usually sharpen directly over a small trash can, but today I'm doing it over some scrap paper I can just pick up and shake out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;1. Starting&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always hold the knife with the blade facing away from you. If you're concerned about the shavings flying into your eye, wear safety goggles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/l291hm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/l291hm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hold the knife at about a 90 degree angle to your pencil, with the blade laying nearly flat against the wood. With the hand holding the pencil, put your thumb against the back of the blade and apply a slight pressure. You will start sharpening by pushing against the knife with your thumb, but &lt;strong&gt;holding the knife completely still&lt;/strong&gt;. The hand with the pencil will do all the work, adjusting the speed and pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do shallow but long strokes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dpzrxm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dpzrxm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/o5qhym.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/o5qhym.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should end up with plenty of shavings, as you can see. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;2. Refining the tip&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you start to expose the core, be careful not to nick it. At first you'll start with only a small bit exposed, but then slowly work your way to exposing the full length you want. Make sure you're not just taking wood off the very front, but going back further up the pencil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/bwIoLm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/bwIoLm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/jga5Im.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/jga5Im.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As picture above, I started by exposing only a small amount, but then shaved portions away from the entire tip to have more lead exposed. If you only work towards the front, the cone of the wood will be too short and increase the likelihood of breakage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once I have what I feel is about the correct length, I test the angle of the wood against a flat surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/7len7.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/7len7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I can't get the wood flush with the surface, that's no good. The purpose of this type of sharpening is to allow for strokes using the full flat of the lead. If the wood is curved inwards (as seen above) or too short, then trying to use the flat may cause breakage. If the slope doesn't flow well into your actual core, then trying to lay the flat of the pencil down may only yield strokes with part of the tip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't happy with my slope, so I worked at it some more. At this point, I do small, quick shavings while rotating the pencil. I'll do this by using the knife to do the work, instead of pushing with my thumb, as it's much faster. However, I've practiced on a bunch of pencils and I'm confident I won't gouge my wood or break the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ended up with a much smoother slope. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/USIPY.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/USIPY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;3. Perfecting the point&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, my point is still blunt! You don't need to sharpen that with the knife, as that's where the sanding pad comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/uwCAvm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/uwCAvm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hold the pencil between your thumb and two fingers and roll it so that pencil rotates. You'll do this while rubbing the lead point along the sandpaper. Make steady, even strokes. Like before, &lt;strong&gt;only the pencil should move&lt;/strong&gt;, and not the sandpaper. As you roll the pencil, the goal is to get a full 360 degree rotation, or close, in one full stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this rotation is that it keeps the point centered in the core and keeps it conical. If you don't rotate enough, you may end up with more of a wedge or oblong shape. Those can be quite useful, if it's your goal, but generally you don't want those other shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also sharpen the point by sanding with your strokes following the length of the pencil, instead of perpendicular to the pencil.

You still need to rotate the pencil as you do this. I spent time making my slope nice, so I used a combination of strokes to get the point to match.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I made a nice, long point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/aSqZam.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/aSqZam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you practice, you may end up making short or longer points, depending on your preference (or skill). The longer the point, the wider the strokes you can make, but also the more likely you are to have breaks while sharpening, using or storing your pencils.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;4. Clean up&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your sandpaper pad may look pretty grim after this. But if you bang it on your table or inside your bin, a fair amount of dust will come off. You can use one sheet for a considerable number of pencils, so don't throw it away too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/NDhVam.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/NDhVam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Before&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/uX7SOm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/uX7SOm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;After&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, &lt;strong&gt;before actually using the pencil, you need to clean it off&lt;/strong&gt;, too. I typically make a bunch of test strokes, and even rub just the wooden part on the paper. A lot of the dust from your core will laying on the surface, and if you don't wipe it off you may end up laying down some accidental, very dark lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use a cloth for this, but I usually just use scratch paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CUYKwm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CUYKwm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The proper way, in general&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The keys to a sharp pencil, without breakage, are generally the same whether you're using a knife or a hand sharpener:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have a sharp blade&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Move the pencil, not the blade&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a handful of sharpeners just like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/73RVjm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/73RVjm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They work great for me. I just keep it steady in my offhand, and turn the pencil with my other. The blades are replaceable, but I have so many sharpeners that I haven't had to do that, yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, I only sharpen one set of by 9B - 9H range of pencils with a knife, and the rest get the hand sharpener treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I avoid electric sharpeners for anything but writing pencils. They violate one of my guidelines, because the blade moves and not the pencil, so I already distrust them. Something about the process seems to increase the chance that the lead cracks internally, and I just end up sharpening them over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They also get gummed up by colored pencils.

Printer and notebook paper have very little &lt;strong&gt;tooth&lt;/strong&gt; (roughness); lack &lt;strong&gt;weight&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., the sheets are thin); and have relatively high acid content, which means they will yellow and become brittle over time.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Different Kinds of Drawing Paper:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The main differences:  Tooth and Weight&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Weight:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Weight&quot; is basically (as the term implies) a measure of how thick and heavy each sheet of paper is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Thicker or heavier papers can handle more water or paint without buckling, curling or falling apart. Traditionally, papers are measured by the weight in pounds of one ream, approximately 500 sheets. If a paper comes in different sizes, its weight will vary even though the thickness has not changed. Each paper type uses a certain size as its &quot;standard.&quot; A ream of standard 22&quot; x 30&quot; watercolor paper (500 sheets) would weigh 300 lbs. The very same thickness paper in a 40&quot; x 60&quot; sheet would have a weight of 1,114 lbs. for the ream of paper. Its weight changed due to the size of the sheets, not the paper's thickness, but the paper is still designated as 300-lb. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The inconsistency of this traditional method has led to the use of metric measurements or grams per square meter or gsm. When paper is measured in gsm, its weight will not change with the size of the sheet. The same 22&quot; x 30&quot; sheet of watercolor paper described above would weigh 640gsm, meaning that a square meter of this paper would weigh 640 grams. Larger size sheets of that same paper, like a 40&quot; x 60&quot; size sheet, also would weigh 640gsm. While different sizes, the square meter remains constant, as does the thickness of the paper.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dickblick.com/productinfo/learn/paper/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dick Blick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Weights (relating to thickness) of paper are standardized and defined by the International Organization for Standardization and are often listed in grams per square meter (gsm), or in pounds, the standard of measurement more familiar to most artists in the U.S.  Following are some of the most common weights of paper found in sketchbooks and drawing pads (all measurements are approximate):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;25 lb (approx 40 gsm):  tracing paper&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  30-35 lb (approx 45-50 gsm):  newsprint&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  50-60 lb (approx 75-90 gsm):  sketching or practice paper — thick enough to work on with pencils, charcoal, or pastels, but usually too thin for ink or most markers, which may bleed through.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  70-80 lb (approx 100-130 gsm): drawing paper suitable for finished artwork in most media.  Paper any lighter than 70lb will usually be thin enough to see through to drawings or materials underneath.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  90-110 lb (approx 180-260 gsm):  heavy-weight drawing paper, bristol, multi-media papers.  Weight in this range is similar to card stock or light poster board.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Heavier papers, up to 140 lb (approx 300 gsm) or more, are most often used for painting rather than drawing.  When found in sketchbooks, they are usually rougher papers intended as watercolor journals or to remove for painting on individual sheets.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-surfaces-and-weights/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Muse Art and Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sketch paper&lt;/strong&gt; is the thinnest, lightest paper, varying from 30 to 60 lbs. It isn't meant be used for finished drawings, as most will discolor and degrade quickly. However, it's economical, and perfect for short studies, thumbnails, compositional sketches, and working out ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watercolor or printmaking paper&lt;/strong&gt; has to be the thickest, heaviest paper because it must withstand the moisture from the water media applied to it. It usually weighs between 90 and 140 lbs. (The smoother, hot press watercolor papers can be great for drawing, also!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphite or charcoal&lt;/strong&gt; drawing paper doesn't need the durability of watercolor or printmaking paper, but is heavier than sketch paper.

The more tooth a paper has, the rougher it is, and the better it will take soft art media like charcoal and pastels.  The less tooth it has, the smoother it is, and the better it will be for fine detail work, harder graphite, pen and ink, etc.  Wet media (ink, watercolors, etc) will be more likely to bleed on a toothier paper;  dry media (charcoal, pastels, etc) will be more likely to slough off of a paper with less tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Surfaces are described as having more or less “tooth,” or roughness in texture. The more toothy the paper, the rougher its surface. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rougher surfaces&lt;/strong&gt; are generally found more in thicker papers. &lt;em&gt;Thick, toothy surfaces hold on to more of the drawing or painting medium and are better for high contrast and lower detail works. Toothier papers are well suited to charcoal, crayon and pastels, ink washes and watercolor&lt;/em&gt;, or any work that utilizes the texture of the paper for aesthetic effect. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoother surfaces&lt;/strong&gt; take up less media and are better suited to more detailed work. Very lightweight papers like tissue paper, and lightweight sketch paper are usually smooth, but thicker papers like bristol and some painting paper are also smooth. &lt;em&gt;Smoother surfaces are ideal for graphite pencil, colored pencil, and ink pens&lt;/em&gt;. Smoother papers are also more likely to be bleedproof, meaning that ink or color washes won’t spread and “feather” across the surface.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-surfaces-and-weights/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Muse Art and Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rough paper&lt;/strong&gt; is chosen for its definite texture. It is the natural result when a sheet is allowed to air dry without smoothing or pressing. Rough surface paper is a good choice for transparent watercolors used in a bold and immediate style, as it allows the pigment of color washes to settle into the hollows of the paper. Pastel artists also generally prefer a paper with &quot;tooth&quot; or texture to grab onto the pastel pigment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold Press paper&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the most popular and versatile, has a slight texture. Handmade papers achieve this by re-pressing a new wet sheet, which smoothes the surface to some degree. Machine-made papers get a similar effect by placing the wet sheets between cold metal rollers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not/Cold Press&lt;/strong&gt;: A &quot;Not&quot; sheet means it is &quot;not hot press,&quot; and the term is often used instead of cold press.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot Press paper&lt;/strong&gt; is very smooth. It is made by running a freshly formed sheet through heated metal rollers or plates. Much like a clothes iron, this smoothes out any texture left by the earlier stages and creates a flat, hard, featureless surface. A good choice for highly detailed illustrations, it is also used for printmaking, etching, drafting, sketching and drawing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dickblick.com/productinfo/learn/paper/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dick Blick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Secondary coniderations:  Fiber and Sizing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Fiber (and acidity):&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Paper is made from a variety of plant sources. Whether the fibers come from cotton or other plants such as linen, flax, jute, hemp, bamboo, rice straw or rattan, they all provide cellulose fibers or plant cells of varying dimensions. A sheet of paper is basically a thin layer of mingled cellulose fibers. Most commonly, three types of fibers are used to produce papers for drawing and painting: cotton, cellulose and a combination of fibers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cotton papers&lt;/strong&gt;, made from the longest cotton fibers, are &lt;em&gt;generally considered the highest quality&lt;/em&gt;. They are referred to as being 100% cotton rag and &lt;em&gt;can handle heavy erasing and working without tearing or showing wear&lt;/em&gt;. High-quality 100% cotton paper can last more than 100 years. However, not all cotton papers are the same. Those made from the lesser-quality, shorter cotton fibers can get fuzzy with reworking. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellulose papers&lt;/strong&gt; are usually made of wood pulp and &lt;em&gt;naturally have an acid content that will destroy the paper over time. The more acidic a paper is, the shorter its life expectancy&lt;/em&gt;. Buffers can be added to make the paper neutral.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dickblick.com/productinfo/learn/paper/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dick Blick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Many papers are acid free. This designation means that the paper has a neutral pH (around 7). Acid-free papers should be selected for work intended to last for long periods of time because papers with higher acid content will deteriorate much faster. For most cellulose-based papers, acid-free also means that lignin and sulfur have been removed from the paper. These are the ingredients in wood-based papers that fade ink and turn paper yellow over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cotton and cotton-rag paper&lt;/strong&gt; do not contain cellulose and are naturally acid-free. Cotton-based papers are also stronger, often thicker, hold up better to a lot of erasing, and perform well for wet media such as watercolor or ink washes. Cotton is often blended with cellulose to add strength and durability to paper. Premium archival papers will often list a ratio of cotton and wood fiber.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-paper-quality/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Muse Art and Design&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pH neutral&lt;/strong&gt; means that the paper had a neutral pH (7) at the time that it was made, but may still contain ingredients that can become acidic over time (for example, the size used to seal the paper).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acid free&lt;/strong&gt; means that nothing acidic (and nothing that can become acidic) was introduced to the paper at any point in the paper-making process. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Some manufacturers (such as Strathmore) take further precautions and make paper at a slightly basic pH of 7.2 to 7.5.  This provides an alkaline buffer to help counter anything acidic that it may come into contact with.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrawingsource.com/drawing-paper.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drawing Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The rate and severity of deterioration result from internal and external factors: most importantly, the composition of the paper and the conditions under which the paper is stored.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Paper is made of cellulose -- a repeating chain of glucose molecules -- derived from plant cell walls. One measure of paper quality is how long the cellulose chains, and subsequently the paper fibers, are: long-fibered paper is stronger and more flexible and durable than short-fibered paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the presence of moisture, acids from the environment (e.g., air pollution, poor-quality enclosures), or from within the paper (e.g., from the raw materials, manufacturing process, deterioration products), repeatedly cut the glucose chains into shorter lengths. This acid hydrolysis reaction produces more acids, feeding further, continued degradation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Mechanical pulping produces paper with the shortest fiber length and does not remove lignin from the wood, which promotes acid hydrolysis. Newspapers are printed on mechanically pulped paper. Chemical pulping removes lignin and does not cut up the cellulose chains as thoroughly as mechanical pulping, yielding a comparatively stronger paper, but which is still not as durable as rag paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Wood pulp paper from before the 1980's also tends to be acidic from alum-rosin sizing (added to the paper to reduce absorbency and minimize bleeding of inks), which, in the presence of moisture, generates sulfuric acid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Acids also form in paper by the absorption of pollutants -- mainly sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Book leaves that are more brown and brittle along the edges than in the center clearly illustrate this absorption of pollutants from the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Research by the Library of Congress has demonstrated that cellulose itself generates acids as it ages, including formic, acetic, lactic, and oxalic acids. Measurable quantities of these acids were observed to form under ambient conditions within weeks of the paper's manufacture. Moreover, paper does not readily release these acids due to strong inter-molecular bonding. This explains why pH neutral papers become increasingly acidic as they age.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/deterioratebrochure.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;U.S. Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Sizing/Absorbency:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sizing&quot; is an additive that makes the paper more resistant to moisture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Papers intended for wet media (paints or inks) are made with sizing, a starch or gelatin that is either included in the paper pulp during the paper-making process, or is applied to the surface of the paper.  Sizing prevents liquid from absorbing too quickly into the paper, allowing some working time to lift, lighten, or move paints or inks by applying more water.  Sizing also helps protect the paper from getting too soggy, which can result in tearing and wrinkling.  Sizing can also help prevent finer ink or paint lines from spreading and feathering.  Sketchbooks intended for wet media should indicate on the cover that the paper is sized.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-surfaces-and-weights/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Muse Art and Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sizing is added to make paper more water-resistant. It keeps the paper from absorbing too much moisture or pigment and helps to keep watercolors or inks brilliant. It also keeps lines and edges looking crisp. It is less important for papers used for dry media. Sizing also can factor into a paper's archival qualities - whether it will sustain or deteriorate over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal sizing&lt;/strong&gt; is added while the paper pulp is still in a liquid state and is maintained in the matter of the paper. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External, Surface or Tub sizing&lt;/strong&gt; is applied to the surface of the paper after the sheet is formed and dried.

These sketchbooks generally contain medium weight paper, about 70 lb. Hard-bound sketchbooks are the toughest and sometimes the expensive. They take more wear and tear, and generally survive longer than spiral or tape-bound books. Depending on the quality and method of binding, hard-bound sketchbooks often do not lay flat when opened all the way, so they can be difficult to use for larger drawings or for writing. Hard-bound sketchbooks are also less likely to have perforated pages, so they’re better thought of as real archival sketchbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spiral-bound&lt;/strong&gt; sketchbooks sometimes have hard covers but their covers often consist of a hard back cover and a thick paper front. Because of this construction, spiral-bound books are a little less hardy than hard-bound sketchbooks. Spiral-bound sketchbooks open flat when put on a surface, so they can be good for ink and paint washes. Spiral-bound sketchbooks often have perforated pages, so pages are easy to remove and have a clean edge for presentation, duplication, mounting, or framing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tape-bound&lt;/strong&gt; sketchbooks generally have fewer pages than hard-bound and spiral-bound sketchbooks and do not have substantial covers. Tape-bound sketchbooks are not rugged, long lasting sketchbooks. Sketchbooks bound in this manner come in a wide variety of surface types and weights, ranging from very thin tissue and tracing paper to heavy bristol and vellum papers. Sometimes, tape-bound sketchbook pages are perforated, but often the pages are held in by a line of adhesive so it is not difficult to pull them out.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-binging-and-perforation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Muse Art and Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single sheets&lt;/strong&gt; are a great way to experiment with a limited quantity of paper. They will often require stretching and taping to remain flat if wet media is being used. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocks&lt;/strong&gt; are a stack of paper glued or bound together on all four sides and mounted on a backing board. A block keeps the paper stretched as you paint. Once the painting is dry, the sheet is removed by inserting a knife between the sheets and gently breaking the binding. Blocks are a good choice for working wet, outdoors or while traveling. The disadvantage is that you can only use one sheet at a time.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dickblick.com/productinfo/learn/paper/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dick Blick&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Printer Paper:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compared to drawing paper, printer paper is cheaper, lower weight, more acidic, has less tooth, can't handle wet media, doesn't take much dry media, can't handle wet media, and is generally crappy in every important respect.

Usually pink in colour and rough in texture (due to the abrasive). This is the same eraser type that would be found on pencils with erasers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These remove graphite by shredding themselves over the paper leaving bits behind. If used incorrectly they can damage your drawing surface by tearing the paper. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also black and white erasers of similar firmness, but erase slightly more like the vinyl/polymer erasers.

This is by design and why most are larger, compared to other typical erasers. The bits help pull and hold the graphite. Because of how they function and the fact they are softer allows them to be used more easily over large areas and don't generally damage the paper.

However, there are some things you can do to moderate the problem, in general (I'm going to answer a bit beyond the question).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pencil Selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pencils that tend to break more easily have off-center cores. If you're buying open stock, take a look at the bottom of the pencil and ensure that the core of it is in the center of the pencil body and not askew. None of mine are in this state, or I'd post a picture, but it's really obvious when you see it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharpening Technique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A little counter-intuitive, but I've found that instead of rotating the pencil in the sharpener, going the other way works better. In this scenario, hold your pencil in your &quot;off&quot; hand and then using your normal hand, rotate a very sharp sharpener around. This should be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sharp, the wood should shave off in a long, continuous strip. If it doesn't then it's time to replace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, don't create a long point. Smaller amounts of exposed core tend to be less fragile and so don't break as often. Find a sharpener that lends itself to that or allows you to control the point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix It Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prismas are wax based and can sometimes be fixed by heating the core to fuse it together again. Prismacolor doesn't recommend the microwave, rather a sunny window spot, but many use the microwave. Just keep it short, seconds at a time. After all, you're not looking to make it runny, just softened enough to fuse again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handle With Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the lead is fragile, avoiding drops and bangs is a must. The problem, of course, is that transportation to your supplier probably banged and bashed them around, causing the odd one to break even before you got it. To that end, I really recommend going with open stock since you can check the pencils there and, as I noted above, you can confirm that it's not askew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change 'em Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the price of Prisma feel is the weakness of the lead. If you're reaching the point that it's too much, then there are alternatives. Faber-Castell and Caran d'Ache make great pencils and they don't have the breakage issue. That's partly because they're vegetable oil based rather than wax, but also the lead is bonded to the wood, so even if there is a break inside, all is not lost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any event, I have no familiarity with Caran d'Ache pencils to use, but the Faber-Castell Polychromos are really very good and also available in open stock. For me, open stock is a must. So, I have the full Polychromos set and a select bunch of Prismacolors (I generally prefer the white Prisma).

There are actually a number of safe and simple approaches that you can do which all have a similar outcome. First though you need to be aware of what you should not do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Be wary of products that will dissolve styrofoam&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of products that react to Styrofoam on a chemical level and cause it to melt. Many spray paints can do this as well and products that contain paint thinner. Many product labels will mention what materials they are and are not designed for. If you are not sure sticking with one of the suggestion below would be advised or at least test in a controlled and well ventilated environment if you must. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Initial coating options&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It does not need to be any sort of heavy coating but something that will try and provide a more uniform surface. In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mod Podge / decoupage&lt;/strong&gt;: Mod podge will work on its own with one or two layers built up. Some light sanding in between layers will help create a smoother surface. You don't need to use the glue alone. You can decoupage as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper mache&lt;/strong&gt;: Using the foam as a base paper mache onto it. I would likely do the entire object (all sides) as this might not adhere to the foam well or at least not long term. Doing all sides would give it no where to go. Not my first choice but this is a fun option for kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Styrofoam safe paints&lt;/strong&gt;: I don't have any specific suggestion here. You will have a hard time using a brush given the rough surface. You might need to use a cloth or something similar to work the paint into all the holes. Let it dry and repeat the process. It will get easier each time as it gets smoother. Water and Acrylic paints apparently work just fine here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plaster of Paris / Geeso / Drywall compound&lt;/strong&gt;: These should be easy to apply to the surface. Don't put it on too think. Much like other approaches Let dry and sand. Drywall compound would be the last choice of these options as it would be brittle. Should still work though. I am putting Geeso in this list as I think it works almost the same although I have no experience with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial Options&lt;/strong&gt;: There is a specific product called Foam Finish which is marketed for use with Styrofoam and related foam products.

Following the instructions on the bottle would be important to ensure you are using the glue properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When gluing macaroni make sure the entire surface, where the noodle is contacting the paper, is also covered in glue for best adhesion (No exposed ends).

I do think between the two of these you should have a good basis for choice though. My breakage tests also are slightly flawed as I don't have the tools to measure pressure exerted nor the ability to make each break with the exact same circumstances. There are other glues that I could have used, however, given my findings, I think the issues would have been the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glues not tested&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are things that I could not test with and choose not use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think a glue stick or glue dots would be good for this. Hot glue gun could work and even double sided tape. In the case of the latter you might have an aesthetics issue. Gorilla glue or PVA's would also work. Gorilla Glue is an expands while it dries, which I know from experience, so it might not be what you want to use here as it might warp the work. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test materials and setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tested with 3 different paper stocks. Canvas paper, thin cardstock and printer paper. For glues I used carpenters glue (Yellow) and white craft glue. These glues can be considered kid safe and non-toxic. Consult product labels to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used brand-less macaroni that I purchased specifically to do macaroni art. The glue was applied with different consistencies to see if the amount of glue was important. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procedure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For each piece of paper I logically divided it into 8 parts. Each glue was given an indicator box and 3 spots where the glue was applied lightly, heavy and an in-between consistency. The white glue had nozzle so I was able to apply it easily. My yellow glue nozzle broke ages ago so I used a craft stick to apply it. The two below pictures show how much of each glue was applied. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/kBjk3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/kBjk3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Glue samples&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I then proceeded to add one piece of macaroni to each glue site. I made sure that the macaroni was lying flat to the paper to increase the gluing surface area. This picture shows the tests in a completed a drying state. The glue is still wet as this point. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIs0Z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIs0Z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Glue samples&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The drying times for each glue was 30-35 minutes. The carpenters glue recommended 24 to allow a full cure. I waited 12 hours before I tested and I think that is fair. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier that this needs to be taken with a grain of salt so I don't suggest using this as a thesis source. This also doesn't cover long term durability&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Here is a picture of the macaronis after I put in effort to remove them all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/lEYwr.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/lEYwr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Noodle massacre&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From left to right: printer paper, light cardstock, canvas paper&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To remove the noodles I used my thumb and pushed from the side of the noodles. There were some that I could not remove like that an had to grab from the end. If the end was not glue I was able to grab under it and pull. If the end were completely glued I would not have been able to do that and it should have been harder to pull off. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found the yellow caprenters glue to be better than the white craft glue but not by much. In all cases the glue held and the &lt;em&gt;paper&lt;/em&gt; failed. As you can see in some pictures the noodles actually broke. I found the canvas paper to hold onto the noodles better. Likely that is because it was thicker and had a textured surface. The printer paper failed easier. In the printer paper's defense the glue still help to the paper rather well. Still, it was the weakest as I expected it to be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The glues warped the printer paper significantly and the cardstock somewhat. While I do notice that the other side of the canvas was wet the overall shape was not change i.e. it remained flat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short if I was to choose, based on best results, my option would be yellow glue with the canvas paper. I would use enough glue to cover the entire noodle and have enough to sightly pool around it (My heavy option pictured above). The cardstock I used was perfectly fine though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1: I do have a tangential case I can refer to for this though. 3 years previous to this post I made a anniversary gift for my wife that was macaroni art.

They're perfect for holding and laying paint onto virtually any surface. However, square-cut brushes don't provide as much control when painting into corners, up to adjacent surfaces, or along narrow edges or surfaces. For more precise control, use a sash brush, which has its bristles cut at a slight angle. Sash brushes are particularly well-suited for cutting in around the perimeter of a room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bristle Tips:&lt;/strong&gt; Better quality brushes have bristles with flagged, or split, ends. Flagged bristles hold more paint and spread paint more smoothly. Some brushes, especially sash brushes, have tipped ends, which should not be confused with flagged ends. Tipped brushes come to a point; they're not cut flat and straight, as is a standard brush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Professional painters favor tipped brushes because they provide greater control and allow you to apply paint more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;More details on different types&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dickblick.com/info/brushhair/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This list&lt;/a&gt; goes into more detail on the usages of synthetic and various types of natural bristles, although it doesn't distinguish between different types of synthetic material:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For blending oil paint on canvas, Badger Hair is an age-old tradtion. It comes from various parts of the world and is more readily available than most animal hair, although the quality varies greatly. Badger hair is thickest at the point, and relatively thin at the root, so it has a distinctive &quot;bushy&quot; appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA: oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camel Hair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Camel Hair does not come from camels at all. It is found in watercolor and lettering brushes and usually is made of squirrel, goat, ox, pony or a blend of several hairs, depending on the desired softness and intended cost of the brush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA: lettering, tempera, watercolor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hog Bristle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Hog Bristle is obtained from hogs in several parts of the world, the most sought after coming from China. Bristle is unlike any other natural filler in that it forms a V-shaped split or &quot;flag&quot; at the tip and tends to have a natural curve. A brush with &quot;interlocked&quot; bristles, with the curves formed inward to the ferrule, has a natural resistance to fraying and spreads medium to thick paints smoothly and evenly. A selection of pure hog bristle brushes is recommended for oil and acrylic painting, and is a far less expensive alternative to good-quality softer hairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA: acrylic, oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevrin/Mongoose Hair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Kevrin/Mongoose Hair is strong, resilient, and makes a good long-wearing, medium to professional quality brush for oil and acrylic painting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA: acrylic, oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolinsky Sable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Kolinsky Sable is not really from a sable at all, but comes from the tail of a species of mink that is a member of the weasel family found in Siberia and northeastern China. It is generally conceded to be the best material for oil and watercolor brushes due to its strength, spring and ability to retain its shape (&quot;snap&quot;). It holds a very fine point or edge. This is considered a professional grade of hair, and if properly cared for, Kolinsky will last for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA, oil, watercolor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ox Hair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The best quality comes from the ears of cattle or oxen. The Ox Hair has a very strong body with silken texture, is very resilient, has good &quot;snap&quot;, but lacks a fine tip. Therefore, it is most useful in medium gradewash brushes, or flat shaped brushes. Frequently, ox hair is blended with other natural hair to increase the resiliency of a brush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA: lettering, watercolor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pony Hair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Pony Hair is soft but strong, from mature animals at least 2 years of age. It is primarily used for scholastic grade brushes, but often blended with other hairs for inexpensive watercolor and touch-up brushes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA: acrylic, scholastic, tempera, watercolor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Sable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Red Sable is obtained from any member of the weasel family with &quot;red&quot; hair, not at all from the animal known as the sable. It is found in a variety of brush styles for many varied mediums, with quality and characteristics varying greatly. A good quality pure Red Sable is a good alternative to the more expensive Kolinsky, with similar performance and durability. Often, weasel hair is blended with ox hair to make a more economical brush, but the fine point is sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA: oil, watercolor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sabeline is actually select, light-colored ox hair dyed to resembled red sable. Lettering and watercolor brushes often use Sabeline mixed with Sable to lower the cost of a brush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA: lettering, watercolor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squirrel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Gray Squirrel (Talayoutky), most highly in demand for lettering brushes and quills, is native to Russia and nearly always fell in short supply. Brown squirrel (Kazan) is more readily available, and is used mainly for medium quality and scholastic watercolor brushes. A very fine, thin hair, taken from squirrel tails, it points as well as Kolinsky, but has very little &quot;snap&quot; because the hair is not very resilient. It works best with liquid paints and inks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA: lettering, watercolor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthetic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Synthetics are man-made of either nylon or polyester filaments. They can be tapered, tipped, flagged, abraded or etched to increase color carrying ability. Often, synthetic filaments are dyed and baked to make them softer and more absorbent. The common name for this filament is &quot;Taklon&quot;. Advantages of synthetic brushes are: 1) They are less prone to damage from solvents, insects or paints. 2) They are easier to keep clean than animal hair brushes because the filaments don't have animal scale structures to trap paint. 3) They are less prone to breakage and are durable on many different surfaces. 4) They are better suited for painting with acrylics because a synthetic filament will withstand the caustic nature of acrylic paints with less damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MEDIA: all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gordonbrush.com/material_descriptions.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; goes into even greater detail on a huge variety of types of bristle, falling into four main families: &lt;strong&gt;animal hair&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;vegetable fibre&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;synthetic&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;wire brush&lt;/strong&gt;.

It is self leveling, and dries hard, clear, and smooth (if done well). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people use resin for larger projects so instead of buying large containers of the stuff for small projects like this you might be able to get away with the smaller ones that you would find in dollar stores and hobby shops. The are advertised as a repairing glue. Small container with 2 tubes that keep the resin and hardener separate. A single plunger extrudes both at the same time. You would have to glue down the stitch to the frame separately in case it tried to escape as it dried (Most recommend 24-48 hours)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do try this make sure you mix the compound &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you apply it to the final product i.e don't dispense right into the frame using the plunger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only potential issues I see here is from the height of the recess in the keychain:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There's a little bit of a lip around the edge of the keychain, but the cross stitch ends up sitting higher than this lip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This might not be an issue.

The substance was so soft and brittle that it required a holder. (Originally, the grey metallic-sheened substance was thought to be a form of lead ore. Hence, the words for ‘pencil’ in several languages literally mean ‘lead pen’. It was not until 1789 that the chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele proved that graphite and lead sulfide were two different minerals, and the geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner coined the name graphite, which stems from ‘gráphein’, meaning ‘to write’ or ‘to draw’ in Greek.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the supply of natural graphite from Borrowdale ran short, the graphite was thinned down with other materials. In 1794, Nicholas-Jaques Conté and Joseph Hardtmuth independently discovered almost at the same time that by mixing graphite with clay it was possible to produce leads with different degrees of hardness, which would preserve the graphite deposits and also accommodate a variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The graphite-clay mixing process was improved by Lothar von Faber in 1839. It was at that time that the hardness grade scale was established. Today, the scale encompasses 17 grades of hardness: 8B–B, HB, F, H–7H. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to Ullmann’s &lt;em&gt;Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry,&lt;/em&gt; the clay content varies from 15 % in the softest lead to ca. 60 % in the hardest. A mixture of about 2 parts of graphite and 1 part of clay gives the usual HB or 2 1/2 degrees of hardness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following image is adapted from product information for the &lt;em&gt;Castell 9000,&lt;/em&gt; which is available in 16 degrees of hardness:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Wx2P.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Wx2P.png&quot; alt=&quot;degrees of hardness&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same scale of hardness is used in ISO standards (for example for the determination of film hardness of paints by pencil test; in this test method, calibrated pencils of known hardness are pushed over the film). The hardness scale in use in the United States employs only numbers. The most important grades in the two scales approximately have the following relationship:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;3B – 1&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2B – 1 1/2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;B – 2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;HB – 2 1/2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;F – 3&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;H – 3 1/2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2H – 4&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;3H – 4 1/2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;4H – 5&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="234" LastActivityDate="2016-05-22T15:07:42.503" CommentCount="0" />

Tortillons being less tight than stumps, likely hollow, and you can clearly see the layers of paper, like the tip of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_pencil&quot;&gt;grease pencil&lt;/a&gt;. Blending stumps are so tightly wound that the seem more like a solid chunk of the paper with a point sanded off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ML2V0m.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ML2V0m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/iDpUkm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/iDpUkm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tortillon and stump&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Left: Pic courtesy &lt;a href=&quot;http://rapidfireart.com/&quot;&gt;rapidfireart.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Right: The top is the back end of the tortillon, where you you can see how it's layered and hollow. The back end of the stump is more stump!&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These give you much more precision over the blending. They come in many sizes, which makes them more adaptable than the five sizes of your fingers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A plus to these is that as they blend, they tend to pick up more of the graphite dust in their fibers, evenly spreading it around the area and getting dust off so you don't need to use a brush or air. Your finger will end up absorbing the graphite or charcoal, but will layer it and compress it from the pressure. These can lead to you smudging dark areas of light ones accidentally if you forget to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The downside is that the tortillons don't really clean up, so if they get too much graphite built up, you'll only want to use them for matching values. To counter this, most tortillons you can purchase have the ability to peel away the outside layer. Failing that, you can use a sandpaper pad, similar to what you can use to sharpen a pencil, to rub off the rough edge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, tortillons, both bought and homemade, tend to give a softer blend than stumps. I've made my own tortillons by wrapping up old drawing paper (possibly with a bad sketch on the inside) and taping the end seam. These homemade tortillons have given me the softest blends, as the dull point often frays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/AFcfum.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/AFcfum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;My homemade tortillon, not a weird cigarette. Notice the curved, feathery tip.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a comparison of the four tools I mentioned, using an HB pencil:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gzqy6.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gzqy6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The first column is blending a solid area, mostly back and forth (not against the strokes, which would blend more evenly).&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The stump and homemade tool hide the strokes the best, in this case.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The second column is a few tight lines, stroking along them. &#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Notice the finger smudged well outside it (oops!), and the others were more precise. However, the homemade one had much &quot;fuzzier&quot; edges, which can be nice.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The last column is gradating out from dark.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As you go down the column, you'll see each tool, in this case, was better and blending from the dark line, so there's not so much of a hard edge between the dark and light. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other thing to notice is that the strokes are almost invisible on the finger patch, and much less visible on the homemade stick.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn't blend any two values together for this demo. You will probably not just lay down a single dark line and blend outward, like my last column. Instead, you'd create a gradation yourself by using pencil pressure and different hardness pencils, then blend those values together with your tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24" LastEditorUserId="24" LastEditDate="2016-05-29T19:37:45.120" LastActivityDate="2016-05-29T19:37:45.120" CommentCount="4" />

This might seem obvious but small changes can affect this. Time of day for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion and Contraction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If working indoors the sun might not be directly on the project initially. If left for many hours &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;, layers may dried with heat from direct sunlight that could make the balloon inside expand. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The opposite could apply as well. If the project was in direct sunlight while the layer was being applied it could have then cooled while it was still setting. When the base you are forming your project on moved it will set in unexpected ways (turning into a raisin). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The balloon shrinking is less of an issue after several layers. Having 2-3 already dried layers gives a good base so the balloon shrinking would be a non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This also could happen if you take the balloon outside for example to have it set faster. A change in the environment while the balloon is drying is likely causing this to fail. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep the project in the same place and avoid changes in temperature. This is more crucial for the first few layers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A wrinkled balloon can usually be ignored by adding more layers assuming the project calls for it. As layers get added the imperfections are hidden. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Busted &quot;seem&quot; can also be fixed by patching with more papier mache. In the case of the pinata this might be less than ideal as it introduces a weak point. Setting layers with the paper strips perpendicular to each other can help fix that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="44" LastActivityDate="2016-05-23T04:11:20.390" CommentCount="0" />

First use this to mark the line along which you want to cut the bottle. Then &lt;strong&gt;apply heat to this line&lt;/strong&gt;; you can do this in a couple of different ways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;by rotating the bottle slowly over an open flame, making sure the flame is directly under the score line so that it doesn't heat too broad an area of the bottle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;by pouring a thin stream of boiling water onto the score line from above, again trying not to let it cover too wide an area&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;After heating the bottle up along the score line, &lt;strong&gt;dunk it in a pail of cold water&lt;/strong&gt; (which you should have prepared beforehand). The shock of passing from heat to cold should weaken the bottle and make it likely to crack along the existing score line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's likely that the bottle won't break the first time you do this, but keep repeating the process multiple times (heat, cold water, heat, cold water) and eventually the bottle should snap in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;String and nail polish remover&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again the basic idea is to alternate extreme heat with extreme cold, but this time you don't need to have a scoring tool because you'll be using a piece of string. You also need something containing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone&quot;&gt;acetone&lt;/a&gt;, the most commonly used example being nail polish remover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take a piece of string, &lt;strong&gt;soak it in nail polish remover&lt;/strong&gt; (or anything else acetoney), and wrap it around the place where you want to cut the bottle. Then &lt;strong&gt;set the string on fire&lt;/strong&gt;, which will apply intense heat to the narrow area on the bottle around where the string is tied. (Obviously, you need to take care that the string doesn't slip to a different position on the bottle. Even more obviosuly, make sure you don't have any of the acetone on your fingers and that the bottle of nail polish remover is placed well away from the flame.) When the flame burns out or you feel enough heat has been applied, &lt;strong&gt;dunk the bottle in a pail of cold water&lt;/strong&gt; as before to provide the stress necessary to crack it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, this is unlikely to work the first time, but you can keep repeating the process, either re-soaking the string to light it again or replacing it by a new piece of string if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whichever method you use, the bottle may not snap completely cleanly, so you should use some sandpaper to smooth off the edge of the broken bottle before using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can see pictures and videos of the process &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-cut-a-bottle-with-string-and-nail-polish-re/?ALLSTEPS&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikihow.com/Cut-a-Glass-Bottle&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

At least four casters will help the bottle rotate while you score the outside (I also saw two mounted rolling pins for this). The jig picture above has a dedicated adjustable cutter. This is helpful but not required. Using the side of the jig as a tool rest you can rotate the bottle with one hand while using the other to set the cutting pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several commercial products that can do this as well if you are more comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ji8qjm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ji8qjm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Small apparatus that you can buy&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In use it would look like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0awGPm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0awGPm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have glass cutting experience but have never used a product like that.

This is surprisingly easy with some boiling water and cold tap water. You basically need to rapidly change the temperature of the glass near the score. You don't need extreme temperature for this though. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This likely has to be repeated a couple of times. Pour over boiling water slowly and rotate the bottle while pouring. After about 10 seconds of this you can take the bottle to the cold water from the tap. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The change in temperature should put enough stress on the bottle and it should fall apart. If you score line was good there is minimal clean up required and some light sanding would give you a smooth surface. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This also give you both ends of the bottle in a usable state. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="44" LastEditorUserId="44" LastEditDate="2016-05-24T01:47:56.017" LastActivityDate="2016-05-24T01:47:56.017" CommentCount="2" />

Here are some tips from my experience:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the cutting tool itself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First of all, envelopeners are consumables: they will become blunt over time and there's not much you can do about it. Since they are cheap, simply replace them once in a while, especially if you start running into issues more often than you used to. Your mileage may vary depending on how often and what types of paper you cut, but mine last less than half a year.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The blade which sits inside the tool is pressed between two halves of the plastic case. You can open the case by inserting a fingernail or a screwdriver blade into the narrow gap between the two halves. This will allow you to:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clean the blade from paper residue which gathers around it. Some envelopeners have a shaft which is supposed to allow the lint to escape from the blade but this does not always work perfectly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When closing the case, press the two pieces of the case firmly together. Sometimes the two halves become a little loose, causing the blade to not be mounted in a fully symmetric manner, which can cause both parts of the paper to move around a single side of blade instead of getting the blade exactly in between them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the cutting technique:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The envelope opener works best if the crease along which you cut is perpendicular to the paper edge. So, it's good for cutting squares but much worse for cutting hexagons. Personally, I use a Swiss Army knife or scissors for cutting hexagons since the envelopener doesn't handle them well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you run into problems such as splitting the sheet into layers instead of cutting along the edge when trying to cut thick paper and the crease along which you cut is pressed too firmly (e.g. using a bone folder). So, sometimes it helps to either not make the crease that sharp, or to fold it in the reverse direction after folding, which also results in a somewhat less sharp fold.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As mentioned above, an envelope opener consists of two plastics casing parts with the blade fixed in the middle right between them. These two halves of the case do not always perfectly fit together and there may be a small gap between them. Sometimes when you start cutting, you may press the paper too deep inside the casing, which causes the creased part of the paper to get stuck in this narrow gap. The solution is to check that you are not inserting the paper too deep.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While these tips do not guarantee a 100% success rate, and I still occasionally make a bad cut, I think that I have become better at using the envelopener over time, so I hope they are helpful for others, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: I summarized these tips and some more in &lt;a href=&quot;http://michal.kosmulski.org/origami/envelopener-origami-usage.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;an article on my homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="344" LastEditorUserId="344" LastEditDate="2016-05-28T18:22:45.780" LastActivityDate="2016-05-28T18:22:45.780" CommentCount="1" />

As a rule of thumb, something that uses a 16×16 grid will usually be simpler than something based around an 48×48 grid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The complexity of line intersections in the CP may indicate how many layers of paper there are in different parts of the model which in turn may indicate the complexity to fold. So intersections where a larger number of creases meet may indicate a more complex model. There will, of course be exceptions, as a simple mountain fold over multiple layers may have the same CP (except for fold orientation) as a complex closed sink along the same line.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look at the finished model. The amount of detail will often indicate the complexity.

Folding along such an embossed line results in a relatively smooth fold even if the curve is complex.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For some models (mostly the organic-looking ones), wet folding can allow very smooth lines to be folded. This is sometimes combined with scoring the paper using your fingernails. Daniel Chang uses such a technique for folding his realistic human faces.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robert J. Lang famously uses a laser tool to score the crease pattern into the paper.

Thick watercolor paper can absorb a lot of water and still stay intact while copy paper will disintegrate or at least tear with even a little moisture. This behavior depends on the paper's thickness, fibre length and sizing. Most wet folding tips found on the web (e.g. about using a spray bottle) apply to thicker paper and not to copy paper. Personally, I have never been able to wet fold copy paper and be happy about the result - it comes apart with even very little water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, first of all, I suggest you get some watercolor paper, 160-300 gsm for a start. Such papers are widely available in artist supply stores and not terribly expensive. Canson Mi-Teintes is a popular brand that comes in many colors but others should do as well. Then, retry your folding sequence and you should see a huge difference compared to copy paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The exact amount of water to use is unfortunately a matter of practice, but when I started wet folding, I always used too much rather than too little. It is easier to re-moisten paper than to dry it quickly, so better start with a smaller amount. You have to remoisten as you fold anyway. For most models, your paper should be damp but not soaking. While 160 or 300 gsm paper feels very stiff and almost not foldable at all when dry, with the right amount of water added it should feel leathery and be able to roll along a smooth curve easily. For some models, you only moisten a certain area of the paper at a time rather than the whole sheet. Also note that moisture takes some time to penetrate the paper, so you should wait a few seconds before applying moisture and checking if the paper has the right properties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rest is a matter of experience, so start with thicker paper and give it a try once more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="344" LastActivityDate="2016-05-25T21:04:55.087" CommentCount="0" />

Methylcellulose (MC)-glued double and triple tissue and well as self-made tissue foil are very popular and relatively inexpensive materials for folding exactly the kind of models you describe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The situation is not hopeless, however. There are ready-made papers which may suit your needs, but you will usually have to pay dearly for the benefit of not having to prepare paper yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For practice, Kraft paper is often very good. It is widely available, strong, and you can get it in a range of thicknesses, including thin (e.g. 40 gsm). It does not look too good, but its folding properties are quite nice and it is inexpensive. You can usually get some variant in a local art supply store and save on shipping fees. This kind of paper often comes in rolls in which case you can get large formats, even above 1 m, easily (you have to cut the square yourself in such case, though).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.origami-shop.com/en/origamipapertissuefoil60x60greenscrapbookingorigamishopcom-xml-219_346_349-1510.html&quot;&gt;Nicolas Terry Tissue Foil&lt;/a&gt; is a ready-to-use replacement for self-made tissue foil and seems to be thinner than what you can make yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Various mulberry papers can be good for this sort of models. They are available online and sometimes in art supply stores (depending on where you live).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A broad range of Washi papers are suitable for complex models. Be careful, however as Washi can mean a lot of different things, from very thin to rather thick. Be sure to check the weight / thickness of the paper.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A number of hand made papers may be suitable but since they are all unique, and often do not even have an official weight rating, it may be hard to find the right one without touching it or having a qualified seller who knows origami choose one for you.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And of course at the high end there's some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.origami-shop.com/en/origamido-paper-xml-207_215_657_285-2000.html&quot;&gt;Origamido available online&lt;/a&gt;. That's what Robert Lang often uses for his best models, though it comes with a price tag of €13 per sheet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These were some specific paper types which may (or may not) fit your model. Note that each particular model may have different requirements on thickness and stiffness of the paper. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/origami-artist-galen/23735114470/&quot;&gt;Shuki Kato's elephant&lt;/a&gt; can certainly be considered a complex model (196 steps) but it can be, and very often is, folded from Elephant Hide paper (110 gsm) which is an absolute no go for most insect models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, think about a particular model. What you can do is search flickr or other places where lots of origami models are displayed for your model. People will often add the paper type and weight to the model's description and this can help you choose paper for your own folding. When you buy online at a specialist origami store, you can also ask the shop about particular paper's suitability for certain kinds of models. No one can guarantee you a good fold (it depends very much on your own work), but they can give you hints which paper may be good and which you should avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ilan Garibi has a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://origamiusa.org/thefold/keywords/278&quot;&gt;paper reviews on OrigamiUSA&lt;/a&gt; where he has reviewed a number of commercially available papers. I have found these reviews to be very helpful when I started to get interested in origami papers myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, here are some properties of the paper you should look for. Generally, you want your paper to be thin, yet strong and crisp. In more detail, this means paying attention to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Paper weight, usually expressed in gsm (grams per square meter). These values are only approximate ratings but they give you an idea of how thick the paper is. 80 gsm is the weight of standard copy paper and is too much for many complex models, for which you should look for 40-60 gsm paper. Some very fine papers used for insects go as low as 20 gsm. Elephant Hide, a thick and stiff paper, is rated at 110 gsm. Papers around 160-300 gsm are suitable for wet folding but hardly foldable dry.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fibre types: hand-made papers have long fibres which is usually a good thing. Longer fibres make the paper stronger and make it behave better when you need to wet fold some detail.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Crispness: it should be possible to make a sharp, well-defined crease at exactly the place you want it and paper should hold the crease well. This is especially important for complex folds like sinks where you precrease a line and then collapse along it. Soft paper has its benefits too, but too soft may make folding difficult.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aging: one of the reasons I started using better papers was I noticed I had to throw away a number of old models which had faded and become very ugly. If you invest a lot of time into folding a complex model, you want it to stay looking fresh for a long time. Chlorine-free and acid-free papers are expected to last longer than those with the extra additives. Hand made papers often avoid these chemicals and age quite well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://origamiusa.org/thefold/article/paper-review-1-elephant-hide&quot;&gt;first paper review by Ilan Garibi&lt;/a&gt; describes these and many more properties which affect how origami paper behaves when you fold it and which make it suitable or not for particular model types.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="344" LastActivityDate="2016-05-27T13:15:27.697" CommentCount="0" />

  <row Id="619" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="613" CreationDate="2016-05-27T21:09:48.900" Score="6" Body="&lt;p&gt;Yes, paper may play a role here. Typical Kami paper (I assume this is what you mean by &quot;square origami paper stock&quot;) is rather thin which means it is easy for the outer, visible layer to become crumpled and embossed with the pattern of the layers below when you squeeze multiple layers together. An example is visible as a diagonal line on the yellow unit in the picture. Thin paper may also wrinkle and deform as you force the flaps inside pockets. In my opinion even plain colored copy paper is often better since it's somewhat thicker and stiffer. You could also try stiffer papers such as Tant or Elephant Hide. They will make it harder to leave marks on the paper as you move it around, but on the other hand the extra stiffness may make connecting the units even harder as it's harder to bend the units as you wrestle with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other important aspect is technique. With tightly-knit models it is usually really hard to insert the last unit or two, so some level of imperfection is probably unavoidable. But there are some things you can do to reduce visible artifacts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Strive for more symmetry as you fold. Instead of just inserting the last flap into its pocket when everything else is already in place, try to close the last vertex where three modules meet in a single step. So instead of two tabs fully inserted and one not at all, try to start with a loose assembly where all three flaps are just barely inserted into their pockets. Then, slowly try to tighten it, inserting the flaps deeper and deeper, all at the same time and trying to keep is as symmetric as possible. At one point the flaps should snap and all fall into their positions simultaneously. This technique requires at least moderately stiff paper and might not work with Kami (but give it a try). It may require a lot of coordination but often this technique allows one to close corners which would be impossible to close by manipulating just a single flap.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When folding, sometimes you have to make inexact folds on purpose in order to accommodate paper thickness. Diagrams are sometimes drawn with &quot;perfect&quot;, zero-thickness paper in mind. Actual paper has non-negligible thickness and when you fold five layers, they are about ½ mm thick which can already be significant. So sometimes when you fold an edge to a point, you should actually fold a little bit before it so that it gets into the right place later when more paper layers accumulate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Practice. Some tricks are just muscle memory and hard to explain to others but you will come up with such tricks yourself and develop techniques that suit you well as you fold more.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cheat. Sometimes you can leave out the last flap by folding it back below the unit instead of into its pocket, and no one will notice. In a model with strong locks, one missing lock will not significantly affect the model's stability and may not be easy to spot visually, either.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="344" LastActivityDate="2016-05-27T21:09:48.900" CommentCount="0" />

If you ever tried writing with a quill and ended up with a blotchy mess instead of some nice calligraphy, part of the reason was probably that you were writing on a horizontal surface, and thus were holding the pen pretty close to vertical. The closer to vertical the pen, the better the ink flows, but if the ink flows too quickly, you get blotches. If you raise your writing surface at an incline, your pen flattens out, and it's easier to write evenly and without blotches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the main reason for using a slanted surface is ergonomics: instead of curling your head over the paper and holding your pen (or other implement) in a death-grip, a slanted surface brings the paper closer to your face -- thus less neck fatigue -- and makes it easier to write/draw with your arm and shoulder instead of your wrist.

They'll stick fairly well to both materials, though presumably not as well as epoxy sold as glue. You have a lot of contact area so the bond will be strong anyway.  A two part epoxy should be quite cheap - if you can get an appropriate size pack, and I'd expect curing over a few hours though you might be able to get quicker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To have it as clear as possible, you need to make sure that you apply enough to fill the gap and get all the air out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've bonded two sheets of clear plastic (one acrylic, one unknown) using ordinary glue epoxy (i.e. not meant to be transparent).

Depending how often you do this you might want to try a smaller one first as the shelf life of the product varies once used. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cheap and quick curing options would be great but I understand you can't have the best of them all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only part about this that does not meet your requirements is that they have a longer curing time then something like a craft glue. Setting inside an hour but fully curing over several days is needed in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The resin and hardener are kept separately as liquids, hence the dual syringe. In larger applications they would be two separate containers. I would suggest not applying directly to your project from the syringe but onto a disposable piece of cardboard or similar. That way you can manually mix the liquids together (usually 1:1 ratio) to ensure an effective reaction. Then use an applicator (craft sticks) to apply to the project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are going to want to clamp this down with decent pressure. There would be the issue of seepage while setting you need to be aware of. Depending on how intricate your cuts are the solution will come out of the wood acrylic sandwich. You want to try and wipe that off &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;  it sets. Epoxy resins dry really hard so if you have to cut part of it off it will no longer show clear on the cut. You can polish the edges once it cures with extra fine sand paper and / or a polishing compound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A long term issue is that set epoxies can yellow over time because of UV radiation.

Given the desired end result I feel that this would be an approach to consider though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This might be difficult depending on your level of expected precision and tool availability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a suggestion but it involves tools that could be expensive to acquire and potentially a difficult process (I have thoughts on that as well near the bottom). The cuts you propose and the shape of your mugs will affect this as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider wet tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cutting materials like glass or ceramics with power tools, wet tools are always advised. You don't want these material fragments stuck to your cutting instruments. Nor do you want the inside of the machine to be exposed to them. Aside from hand tools, that would not have this issue, I would suggest that any power tool you consider be a wet tool. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Easy tools to comes by for this type of task would be a wet tile saw or a ring saw. Both are for cutting ceramics and glass (as well as some other materials). However neither common variety will have the thickness clearance of your average mug. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore a wet band-saw would be a good suggestion here. While there are not too many of these available from what I could tell the real issue is trying to get precision cuts with one of these devices. Of the 4 common ones that showed up in my research they had mostly plastic frames (Likely due to the use of water) and only a couple had what I might consider a mitre slot (Which would be useful for making custom bandsaw sleds). This is important part of the precision I think you would need. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/KLfSv.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/KLfSvm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mitre Slot&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: The above picture is not a wet bandsaw. It is used to highlight the presence of a mitre slot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following related video where a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiMurfOL8EM&quot;&gt;bottle is cut with a wet bandsaw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jigs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with mugs is, depending on your cuts, you cannot make them perfectly straight free hand. At least not without practice experience. This is a major factor here since you intend to reassemble them after. This is also a hard topic to expand on as every mug and every style of cut might need a specialized jig.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the features of this jig\sled on a bandsaw.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/R3vRL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/R3vRLm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mitre sled&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wood in the picture is being held against two fences. Rear fence holds the work 90 degrees to the blade and the other fence is adjustable (see the wheel) to help move the cut in or away from the blade. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your cups are not flat (at least not the one pictured) so you will need to modify this design. When cutting into curves you need to prevent the cup from rolling around so an easy way to get that is to have two blocks angled into each other (like chucks on a car or plane wheel).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/HZn7U.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/HZn7U.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Made in sketchup to illustrate the design&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cup has somewhere to rest and the adjustable fence will give you something to push against to make sure the cut is straight. That design only covers your first cut examples though. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting mugs of a uniform width makes this part so much easier to mitigate. A jig would be useful if you were using power tools or not. The idea is to place the cut in a certain position where it will not move unpredictably while you are cutting it. If you are doing it with hand tools then clamps would help as well. Clamps would be good for power tools as well but their position could be awkward and you don't want to risk damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blade kerf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your cutting tool, powered or not, you are going to have an issue with the kerf(width of the cut) of blade. Let say that you cut the mug down the exact middle of two identical mugs. Lets assume that your blade kerf is 1/8&quot;. When you go to put that mug together it will now be ~1/8&quot; smaller so the edges of the mugs won't line up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not the end of the world obviously. You can address this but cutting off center on your mugs. On one mug you could cut a kerfs width to the right of the cut line and the other a kerfs width to the left. This also means you could have to cuts extra mugs to get the pieces you need. This also assumes your level of perfection your are trying to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you are cutting make sure you cut slow. Make sure you cut slow as to not force the blade askew or cause any burning. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it is doable with power tools but unless I am way off the mark there would be some work involved in getting the right environment to do this properly . If you are willing to concede on some degree of perfection and willing to practice I think hand tools might be the way to go like &lt;a href=&quot;http://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/654/44&quot;&gt;Chris H suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Several caveats above would still apply. You might, in either case, consider food safe grout to make up for any size consistencies. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is still feasible though how I describe.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to tools/workspace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are locations that are set up for you to have access to industrial tools.

Don't twist or braid too tightly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firmly tie off the ends of the braid/twist with an elastic, so it'll continue to hold together as the skein gets smaller. When you need a thread, grab it at the fold and pull it out.

Loomis is a very well-known figure artist and illustrator with a variety of instructional books that are very helpful.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This construction, in drawing from the mind, is usually done by understanding some sort of system of proportions and then altering features to add character. Proportions would compare head height to width, or divide head height into sections to place features (seen in the images above), but it can get much more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By understanding these general relationships of constructing a figure, you begin to see how real heads and faces compare and vary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One popular method of achieving this development of form is called &lt;strong&gt;blocking-in&lt;/strong&gt;. You can see a quality example of &lt;a href=&quot;http://georgetownatelier.com/tutorials/introductory-tutorials/color-temperaturefigure-drawing-part-3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blocking-in using the Atelier method&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://georgetownatelier.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GeorgetownAtelier.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;sub&gt;Depiction of bust of bare derriere in spoiler block, from that website.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/jtBxQ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/jtBxQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can start your base block-in similar to drawing an initial outline. But, instead of just focusing on the silhouette, think about the form in 3D. The outline will guide you on the proportions to use as you develop your other planes and shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then slowly add details, keeping your sketch light. You can measure placements of features, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Where is the top arch of the eyebrow compare to the ears?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you draw a straight vertical line on the side of the nostril wing, how far is the corner of the eye? (Or vice-versa)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Compared to the length of the nose, what's the distance between the tip of the nose to the bottom of the chin?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What degree of angle is it from the outside corner of the eye to the tip of the nose?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you draw a straight vertical line on corner of the mouth, how does it compare to the center of the eye?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are pretty limited examples. The key to getting an accurate portrait of a real person is by getting the proportions and placements correct for &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; anatomy. Since you can start with height or width, you can scale the other dimensions based on that, and then scale every other proportion on others you know you did &quot;right&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more you analyze the geometry, the more accurate you'll be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Measuring this way can be done with classical techniques such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drawinghowtodraw.com/stepbystepdrawinglessons/2010/01/how-to-find-measurements-proportions-and-angles-to-draw-with-pencil-thumb-method/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;using your pencil as a measuring stick&lt;/a&gt;, which can also be aided by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drawingacademy.com/use-of-plumb-line-in-drawing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plumb line&lt;/a&gt; for getting objective verticals.

For the primer, try to find a paint that's specifically meant for plastic: you want something that's guaranteed to stick to the plastic, and then your gold adhesive will stick to the paint (or at least it should), and then the metal leaf will stick to the gold adhesive, and then (after everything has cured as fully as it ever will, but before oxidation has set in) seal the metal leaf both to protect it from abrasion and to prevent tarnishing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what specific steps you follow, you may end up with a phone case that's noticeably thicker than it was before.

If this was a little bit different then other options might be viable as well. Perhaps using Plasticine or silicone to create a mold of the void. It would allow you to trace around the mold you create and get a gauge on depth. Unless you plan on repeating this those options are not very efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cutting the veneer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When creating the veneer you have a couple of options. You could cut out the shape from an existing veneer piece or cut your shape from larger stock and slice the veneer off of that. If you are just cutting preexisting veneer a craft knife might be enough. Warning if you go that route to not attempt to cut all way though at once. The knife could catch and follow the grain potentially ruining the cut. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bandsaw would be a well rounded tool in either case. Using a fine tooth it will make easy work of the template and reduce the amount of sanding potentially required. Beware of the kerf when cutting your veneer. Cut outside the line you made. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Make your own veneer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have veneer or the veneer you have does not fit inside the void perfectly then you might have better luck cutting your own veneer (too large is fixable by sanding but too small is harder to recover from.). Use stock large enough so that you can maneuver around the bandsaw with your hand comfortably away from the blade. First, bring the fence ~0.5mm from the blade and push through. Consider making it a little thicker and sanding the face because I cannot tell from the photo if the wood is perfectly flat or contoured. With your new perfectly size veneer you can now cut it to shape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Help prevent sanding an sizing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get cleaner cuts on your veneer when using power tools like the bandsaw you can always sandwich the veneer inside some sacrificial wood. This will reduce the tear-out on the veneer to nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Pay attention to the direction of wood grain&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One major point about cutting your veneer is make sure the length of the shape you are making follows the grain of the wood. If you cut it against the grain is will weaken the wood making it easier to break in half. Notice the grain direction in one of the other partitions of the bracelet. You should cut the veneer the same. While it might be fine once set you will notice a difference if you are sanding it or maneuvering the veneer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UZF7H.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UZF7Hm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Showing grain direction&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Click image to enlarge&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="44" LastActivityDate="2016-06-07T00:59:50.573" CommentCount="1" />

The first day our teacher said if you have put your first mark on paper, starting from point A to point B,  &lt;strong&gt;Don't trace back from point B to A&lt;/strong&gt;, because not only it makes the thing untidy but the accuracy or in this case value of that line gets lost. Rather he said draw a line from point A to B again draw a line from point A to B.

Reds are well known to fade more quickly than other colors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also recommend adding at least one matting layer to put some space between the work and the glass, again, to prevent the stitches from being flattened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="52" LastActivityDate="2016-06-07T13:58:45.470" CommentCount="0" />

It would seem to be especially valuable when a drawing has so many elements as these do. Without compositional aides, a drawing could become a confusing visual blur or a flat pattern. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Decide what elements you want to focus on - the main idea. There can also be secondary foci, so that your eye moves across a drawing. In the lower drawing, with the birds and butterflies, romanticized flight/wings seem to be the theme here. The top butterfly and bird seem to be &lt;strong&gt;focal point&lt;/strong&gt;s along with the bottom butterfly. The groupings &lt;strong&gt;balance&lt;/strong&gt; each other, giving weight and focus to both the top and bottom of the drawing, in spite of the fancifully airy nature of the drawing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Techniques that add dimensional depth are clearly seen here. &lt;strong&gt;Perspective&lt;/strong&gt; makes it appear as though the elements are spiraling downwards away from us and disappearing towards the center of the page. Perspective is summoned in several ways: overlapping, line weight, and the paleness of the more &quot;distant&quot; objects. When objects &lt;strong&gt;overlap&lt;/strong&gt;, even in a drawing, our brains interpret the partially blocked objects as being behind the others and therefore, farther away. For example, on the outer edge of the drawing, rhododendron-like flowers overlap the vines. This makes the flowers pop towards us while in the center, one bird overlaps another. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The line weights vary across the drawing. Darker lines do two things here - they denote object boundaries in space and denote atmospheric perspective. Where a line marks the &lt;strong&gt;boundary between an object and open space&lt;/strong&gt;, it's darker, like in the body outline of the upper right bird. Lines on the bird's body that relate detail, but are not free-standing in space, were given a lighter weight, as in the feathers. When you observe a panoramic landscape, you see that the lines (and colors) that are closer to you have more weight and vibrancy, while as space recedes, the lines and colors become less vibrant, more pale, and more greyed-out. This is called &lt;strong&gt;atmospheric perspective&lt;/strong&gt;. Compare the heavy lies of those rhododendron-like flowers that pop out towards us with the soft, thin lines of the terminal tip of the vine at the center of the drawing. That tip fades into the distance, contributing to an impression of depth in the drawing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proportion&lt;/strong&gt; also aides the impression of depth. Unfortunately, it's less obvious here. Two similar objects (species of bird, flower, or butterfly) should be about the same size unless one is &quot;farther away&quot; to it's twin. The only object that really does that here is the spiraling vine. Along the outer edge of the drawing, the vines are drawn with more line weight showing the boundary between solid and space, that they are closer to us than the terminal tip in the center is, and the diameter of those vines are proportionally thicker at the outer edge than those tender terminals that seem farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This link provides a brief discussion of common compositional concepts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-design-elements-of-composing-a-drawing.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Drawing for Dummies&quot;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="456" LastActivityDate="2016-06-08T11:07:41.910" CommentCount="0" />

Hide glue has a good set of features and some drawbacks depending on how your application&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Number one being that it is non-toxic. It is a forgiving glue as you can reheat it once it has set to move or adjust what you are making or repairing in some cases. Since it is made from animal proprieties it is biodegradable. Its sets rather quickly which can be both a pro and a con. One major draw back is that it is water soluble and affected by humidity so this is &lt;em&gt;not for outdoor use&lt;/em&gt; which may be a draw back here given your pictures.

So I'd simply use a serrated knife. Something like this one:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/HfDBOm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/HfDBOm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and saw the straw with it. Pay attention to really use the sawing part of the knife (this is why the teeth are important), i.e. don't press the knife too firmly against the straw to make sure that you don't break it. You can then smooth the edges of your cut again by using some kind of heating process. In this case, I would even consider having a very hot surface and then simply press (as vertically as possible) the end points of your straw on the surface. Ideally, you have a pencil ready to put it in the straw when the plastic is soft and make sure that the hole is not obstructed by the plastic. &#xA;I'm pretty sure this should work well. In fact, you could also use this knife to get third type of holes in straw (my guess is that different holes will lead to different sounds).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Solution 2: This is based on a surprising experiment I made one evening by pure interest. And actually you could consider merging some ideas of this solution with Solution 1. The experiment was easy, take a plastic glass fill it with water and try to make a whole in the glass with a lighter to empty some water: impossible. The plastic above the water will melt exactly until the water level is reached and afterward, no way to go further... (maybe with a blowtorch it could work but this is not the goal here). Moreover, the melted plastic tends to curl outside the glass and does clearly not go where the water is. So you can use this phenomenon at your advantage: Indeed you could stuck one side of the straw (with a chewing gum or something similar), fill it with water at the level you wish and melt the remaining part. If you have to melt 2/3 of your straw this will eventually be long and smoky (and this are the kind of smokes your lungs really want to avoid). So, I would consider first cutting the main part with a knife and then make the last 3-5 millimeters in this way in order to get a very smooth result.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the holes:&lt;/strong&gt;    (to make a regular flute)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Actually I misread the question at first (and forgot about the &quot;pan&quot; part of your flute), so these solutions can be useful if you want to build a regular flute with several holes in the same straw (which IMO could also be an interesting option to consider).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solution 1: Consider a tool like this one (an awl):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/fDOkem.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/fDOkem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hold the extremity above a candle and then make your hole. The heat should (locally) soften the plastic and make a relatively neat hole. Just pay attention to retain your move in order to avoid piercing both sides of the straw :). Note that you could also put something in the straw to stop the awl on the midway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solution 2: Another way could be to use sand paper rolled. I would wrap a pencil with sandpaper and use it to make the whole. The advantage is that the whole will be even more clean however you'll get a kind of ellipsoidal hole (which might change the sound of your instrument) and you can certainly not make as small holes as with Solution 1. Another relatively small drawback is that this is very sand paper consuming. Indeed, my experience, is that when rubbing with sandpaper, the plastic will melt a bit on your sandpaper which makes it quickly unusable (but at least sandpaper is quite cheap). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solution 3: Use the same knife as in the first part of this answer and cut some &quot;V&quot;'s in your straw, something like that (cut along the red lines):&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/WOiMB.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/WOiMB.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;you will get a third type of holes. The problem however (as well as the solution with sandpaper but even worst) is that the different holes will likely be different from each other, so unless you have some other tools to make sure that the cut will be exactly at 45° and not pass the half of the straw, I would avoid this solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="71" LastEditorUserId="52" LastEditDate="2016-06-10T15:58:39.800" LastActivityDate="2016-06-10T15:58:39.800" CommentCount="0" />
