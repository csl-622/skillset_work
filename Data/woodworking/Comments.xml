I think you should revise your first statement because I don't believe there's any evidence that diluted lemon juice is particularly easy or the most efficient. For me it would certainly be much easier to use vinegar since I can buy it in bulk, so I wouldn't have to juice a dozen lemons for example! And it can't be said to be most efficient since stronger acids and/or more concentrated solutions will unquestionably be much faster (the difference in speed will be particularly notable on heavy rust encrustations which could take minutes to de-rust vs hours)."
