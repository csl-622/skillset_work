They have rules and exercises to test your grammar and other *non-interactive* [linguistic devices][1]. However, this is a very limited scope of language and trains you only to that particular author's style and literary interpretation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Media (movies, tv, music, &amp;c.) add more for your understanding of a language, but is still one directional (the movies can not verify if what you heard was correct or not) and tends to be very informal and slurred.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In your example of Chinese (which I speak), many characters have the same pronunciation which can lead to written passages that make sense when written, but not spoken (see the famous [Lion Eating Poet in the Stone Den Poem][2] for an example). In spoken, colloquial Chinese, many people will draw characters on their hands or give a phrase where the character occurs to clarify the spoken meaning. These may or may not be presented in books and media.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are also the non-verbal linguistic cues (body language) that cannot be fully communicated in writing. For example, in Chinese, rather than say &quot;death&quot; or that someone &quot;passed&quot;, many people (especially the older generation) will just stop speaking and curl their index finger in front of you to indicated that someone has died.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With all of this said, books and media provide a good foundation for comprehension, but true fluency is improbable with just those resources.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/linguistic-devices.aspx&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den" />

In fact, Esperanto, being by far the most popular constructed language, does have native speakers. People with different first languages who have met through the Esperanto community have bought up children with Esperanto as their first language. In fact, I believe that there are now some second-generation speakers. (Of course, all such people will also speak at least one other language, but still, native speakers of Esperanto *do* exist.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now on to answering the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are, of course, many reasons why one might choose to learn Esperanto, just as there are many reasons for learning any other language, but most are off topic for this site. I imagine you’re asking about learning Esperanto as a stepping-stone to learning another language. Some experts do indeed recommend this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The theory is that Esperanto, being a constructed regular language, is fairly easy to learn, and that learning *a* language makes it easier for you to learn another.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first part of that is undeniably true: Esperanto *is* easy to learn (at least, compared to most other languages). The second does have some supporting evidence, but it is tentative. The idea of learning Esperanto first has been around for a while, but what probably jumped it into the public consciousness was [Tim Morley’s talk at TEDxGranta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gSAkUOElsg), who described using Esperanto in British primary schools.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And it *worked*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But there are some considerations which may not apply to an adult learner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* One of the problems was a lack of teachers qualified to teach French directly. It’s easier to *train teachers* to teach Esperanto. This probably won’t apply in your case.&#xD;&#xA;* This was, specifically, the *first* foreign language learned by these children. If you’ve already learned a second language and are now tackling a third, most of the considerations won’t apply.&#xD;&#xA;* Learning in a classroom situation, having your peers fairly fluent is an aid to learning and confidence. Therefore, a language which is quick and easy to learn will build confidence.&#xD;&#xA;* You can jump to the “creative” stuff quicker, which builds confidence, interest, and joy. Again, this probably applies more to children." />

For some words, I also have a card where I must spell the word, after hearing it spoken.  These are all different aspects of vocabulary, and the different memory skills tend to strengthen each other, by building stronger memories.

Personally, I Google 'semantics of [the language to be learned] prepositions' and try to understand the resulting linguistics papers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`Optional Reading:` The following omittable supplement is published identically in 2 sources by the same author, [Prof Andrea Tyler](http://faculty.georgetown.edu/tyleran/): &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;[p 2](http://vialjournal.webs.uvigo.es/pdf/Vial-2011-Article7.pdf), *Applying  Cognitive  Linguistics  to  Learning  the  Semantics  of  English &#xD;&#xA;to, for &#xD;&#xA;and&#xD;&#xA; at: &#xD;&#xA;An Experimental Investigation*, also by C Mueller, V Ho.         &#xD;&#xA;[pp 130-131](https://books.google.ca/books?id=jOiSAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;ots=3cUc49Eme1&amp;dq=%22semantics%20of%20prepositions%22%20L2&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=%22semantics%20of%20prepositions%22%20L2&amp;f=false), *[Cognitive Linguistics and Second Language Learning: Theoretical Basics and Experimental Evidence](http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Linguistics-Second-Language-Learning/dp/0415802504)*.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Language  teachers  and  researchers  have  long  recognized  that  the  acquisition  &#xD;&#xA;of  prepositions  poses  major  challenges  for  second  language  learners  (e.g.,  Celce-&#xD;&#xA;Murcia  and  Larsen-Freeman,  1999).     &#xD;&#xA;One  reason  for  this  is  that  the  semantics  of  prepositions are    notoriously difficult to characterize. [...]  Additionally, prepositions tend to develop a complex &#xD;&#xA;set  of  extended  meanings,  for  instance,  *over* &#xD;&#xA;has  developed  at  least  16  meanings,  many of which do not appear to be systematically related. Although linguists have &#xD;&#xA;long been aware that prepositions develop complex polysemy networks, the meaning networks  surrounding  spatial  markers  (and  the  systematic  processes  of  meaning  extension  from  which  they  result)  have  only  become  the  foci  of  linguistic  inquiry  &#xD;&#xA;in  the  last  20  years.  Even  the  best  descriptive  grammars  and  dictionaries  present  &#xD;&#xA;the multiple meanings of spatial language as largely arbitrary. Traditional accounts &#xD;&#xA;have represented the semantics of English prepositions as arbitrary (Bloomfield, 1933; Frank,  1972;  Chomsky,  1995).  Consequently,  pedagogical  treatments  have  often  suggested memorization as the best strategy. Studies show that accurate use of spatial &#xD;&#xA;language is one of the last elements learned and many highly proficient L2 speakers &#xD;&#xA;never  attain  native  speaker-like  use  (e.g.,&#xD;&#xA;  Lam,  2009).  Indeed,  Lam  found  that  L2  Spanish learners made virtually no gains in their mastery of the prepositions &#xD;&#xA;*por*&#xD;&#xA; and &#xD;&#xA;*para*&#xD;&#xA; over the course of four years of college Spanish." />

As a result, there are definitely pros and cons to both.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One main facet is pronunciation. I've found it far more difficult to pronounce Spanish words than my peers as learning French meant learning the ins and outs of its pronunciation, most of which are starkly different between each language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another facet is similarities in the nouns themselves. There are many similarities between both languages in terms of words; as [@Tom Au](http://languagelearning.stackexchange.com/users/46/tom-au) pointed out in his answer, but there are also many differences. Distinguishing only comes with practice, so I suppose in this sense it could be simultaneously easier and difficult.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I haven't learned enough grammar in each language to conclude whether the languages' grammars are similar, but from what I've learned much remains the same between them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Honestly, most of the difficulty comes from burning out on one language or the other.

Flash cards prompt one's memory in a **random order**, hence, building neural connections between the meaning, phonetic value, and spelling.&#xD;&#xA;1. Flash cards naturally aid **repetition**, a key for study. Nobody remembers everything from the first try. Our brain takes up to 20% of the entire energy the human body consumes, so memory is naturally lazy; it tries to forget whatever it seems to be unused in order to save power. Only repetition &quot;convinces&quot; our brain that this piece of information is, indeed, important.&#xD;&#xA;1. Flash cards also aid **mnemonic memorizing**. Say, when you learn Chinese, it is easy to make your your flash cards of four *different colors* to quickly remember *the lexical tones*. Even a minor scratch or paint leak in the corner of a flash card can be remembered well, therefore helping memory.&#xD;&#xA;1. Flash cards **are cheap**. They are even cheaper than freeware MP3 podcasts you download into your phone for listening.&#xD;&#xA;1. Flash cards give you an **instant feedback**. There's no complicated scoring; your answer is either right or wrong. In case of a mistake, it's easy to return the card back into the stock and make any corrections with your course in real-time.&#xD;&#xA;1. When teaching kids, the process of making your own flash cards is a kind of a game. **Gamification** is a key technique teaching kids.&#xD;&#xA;1. Flash cards are confined to a **limited (rectangular) space**. Rectangular area of a vivid color is a great tool for keeping one's attention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having this said, we must realize that everybody is different. Some factor may work better or worse with a certain language student. However, the combination of all factors above make flash cards a really good tool for language acquisition." />

I have a student who feels comfortable doing grammatical exercises, as those are reasonably clear-cut, compared to, say, writing or speaking. Grammar exercises are almost always either correct or incorrect, with little middle ground. On the other hand, for some people, they are simply dreary, boring and can be utterly discouraging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Grammar exercises are the linguistic equivalent of math drills. Sure, an elementary school student might understand how multiplication works, but solving problem after problem after problem helps him internalize this knowledge so that when he's an adult buying 6 apples, $0.50 each, he doesn't need to think long and hard to know that he'll need to pay $3 at the register. It's the same with grammar exercises: solving problems helps you review and internalize grammatical structures so that you'll be able to automatically use correct language later on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Keep in mind that grammar drills let you practice structures that may not appear quite as frequently in authentic language. For instance: the French passé simple is a literary tense that is fairly rare nowadays, so you won't come across it too often. To get the same exposure to the passé simple in authentic language as you would working through a single unit in a grammar book, you would probably need to write quite a few texts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Many exercise types let you focus only on the grammar, and ignore the other things (for instance, vocabulary choice). Again, this is helpful - especially if you are learning a new grammatical structure, or know about your weaknesses / problem areas and want to work on those.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Thanks to the clear-cut quality of grammar exercises, they're also much easier to check on your own, without the help of a teacher or native speaker. This means you can fix much of your grammar on your own, leaving your teacher to help you with the more difficult, somewhat more subjective things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Jamming a bunch of examples next to each other is helpful (although this might only work for some types of language learners) in that it lets you compare the different uses, note exceptions, and find patterns of your own that make sense to you personally. It's hard to find patterns across 20 pages, but much easier if you have 20 sentences listed on one page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. Doing plenty of grammar exercises also lets you identify problem areas within topics you might think you are already proficient with. For instance, English articles (a/an/the/-) are very difficult for Poles (as Polish has no articles), but there comes a time (fairly late in the game, admittedly) when a Polish learner of English thinks he has mastered the article. Working through a set of exercises will help identify specific instances of misuse within a topic that is, overall, generally no longer problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All that being said - grammar exercises are not the be all and end all. One only truly knows a language if they can use all of its aspects (vocabulary, grammar, pronounce, spelling, idioms, etc) together. Grammar is just one of several building blocks, and grammar exercises simply help you make sure that that block is as solid as it can be before you build the rest of your structure on it." />

Whatever you choose to watch, try to focus on the various aspects of ASL - the sign itself, facial expressions, style, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While there aren't many ways to *easily* write sign languages down, there are also flashcards of various types that you can use as aids - e.g. [Barron's 500 Flash Cards of American Sign Language][1] - but just going through the cards without making the accompanying gestures won't help you much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, while flashcards for recognition must have images (or videos, if we lived in the world of Harry Potter) on them, keep in mind that for recall, you don't need must beyond a list of words. You can probably get away with a stack of cards with the word on one side and a verbal reminder of some sort on the other. If you really don't remember what the sign looks like, you can then check in an online dictionary, but for the most part, this should be sufficient for review purposes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.amazon.com/Barrons-Flash-Cards-American-Language/dp/0764162225" />

It isn't often that we spend an hour or more talking to a single person about a single subject, so it will take some getting used to in the first lesson or two. Don't let this hold you back - keep the conversations fluid and you will learn lots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The number of activities available is much lower. There are a lot of group activities that will be unusable with only two members.

Text="#Yes, there have been studies showing some disadvantages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[**Bialystok (2008)**](http://www.yumingschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bilingualism.-The-good-the-bad-and-the-indifferent.pdf) notes that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It is now well documented that bilinguals generally control a smaller vocabulary in each language than monolinguals (Oller and Eilers, 2002; Perani et al., 2003; Portocarrero, Burright and Donovick, 2007).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This has been found to be true in children, adolescents, and adults, although the author notes that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The bilingual deficits in lexical access and retrieval persist with aging (Gollan, Fennema-Notestine, Montoya and Jernigan, 2007), although a study by Gollan, Montoya, Cera, and Sandoval (2008) showed that the effects of aging&#xD;&#xA;interacted with word frequency in that older bilinguals demonstrated a smaller deficit for low-frequencywords.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[**Protocarrero et al. (2007)**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887617707000224%20) come to the same conclusion as Bialystok and the other studies cited.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the reasons for this are not known, there are two competing theories:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Bilinguals, on average, use each language less often, and therefore reinforcement of different links is weaker in each language.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Bilinguals may have worse abilities to recall words because their L2 language may have been learned significantly later than their L1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that older studies believed that bilingualism caused a reduction in IQ (see e.g. [**Darcy (1953)**](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08856559.1953.10533654?journalCode=vzpg20)). However, these studies were flawed and are no longer accepted as accurate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There seems to be a consensus that bilingualism is, on the whole, an advantage, and various benefits are constantly touted. I'm not disputing those findings, but it's interesting to pay attention to the fact that there may be a bias *towards* studies that show that bilingualism is a positive thing, as [this *New Yorker* article says](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/bilingual-advantage-aging-brain) (the cited study is [**de Bruin et al.

Phonetics analyzes all sounds arising from human speech, regardless of the language or meaning. Phonology studies the sounds in context, searching for patterns by determining which sounds contain meaning, then explaining how these sounds are understood by a native speaker. So while phonetics studies how the letter &quot;f&quot; is produced (what parts of the mouth are used and how, in order to say an &quot;f&quot;) and how it is perceived, phonology analyzes how the words fa and va have different meanings, despite only differing by one sound.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

You depend on the language to survive—to buy groceries, to talk to employers and customers, to ask for directions, etc.  Being forced to use the language means you learn it even when you're not actively trying to.  It becomes a way of life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**You learn the language in more than one way.**  Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don't know a word, you simply can't communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you're trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own.  This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**You begin to think in the language.**  If you use the language enough you'll start to get good enough at it that you won't have time to think in your native language and translate.  Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs we read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say &quot;excuse me&quot; or ask for help.  Because you can't afford long delays, you'll begin to skip the translation step.  This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Culture reinforces language learning.**  When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language.  Your brain will retain the new knowledge and experiences you acquire better because it is different than what you are used to, and if the language is part of that cultural experience, you will remember it better.  For example, you might remember an idiom or a joke that only exists in the language you are learning.  This will expand your ability to communicate in that language." />

For our example, the first line of the chorus from “Do-Re-Mi” fits perfectly: “Doe a deer, a female deer…”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. **Now swap the target phrase in place of the original lyrics, maintaining the melody.** So this time, you sing “Un mo-men-to por fa-vor” to the tune of “Do-Re-Mi.”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. **Repeat as often as possible.** This last step is another important one. You’ll find that it can sound a bit awkward at first. Don’t be discouraged and stick with it. Keep on singing until it stops being awkward.

This is because every strategy has certain strengths (certain skills it builds well) and certain weaknesses (skills it doesn't cover well)- and if you keep using one strategy, you'll be only focusing on the strengths (but with diminishing returns), and not addressing the weaknesses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using flashcards helps you establish word-to-meaning equivalences quickly, but it usually does so with a shallow meaning, ignoring the breadth of meaning that words usually have.

Flash cards prompt one's memory in a **random order** (unlike, for example, lectures), hence, building neural connections between the meaning, phonetic value, and spelling.&#xD;&#xA;1. Flash cards naturally aid **repetition**, a key for study. Nobody remembers everything from the first try. Our brain takes up to 20% of the entire energy the human body consumes, so memory is naturally lazy; it tries to forget whatever it seems to be unused in order to save energy.  &#xD;&#xA;Only repetition &quot;convinces&quot; our brain that this piece of information is, indeed, important.&#xD;&#xA;1. Flash cards also aid **mnemonic memorizing** by linking visual representation and the meaning. Even a minor scratch or paint leak in the corner of a flash card can be remembered well, along with the word being learned. Say, when you learn Chinese, it is easy to make your flash cards of four *different colors* to quickly remember *the lexical tones*.&#xD;&#xA;1. Flash cards **are cheap**. They are even cheaper than freeware MP3 podcasts you download into your phone for listening.&#xD;&#xA;1. Flash cards give you an **instant feedback**. There's no complicated scoring; your answer is either right or wrong. In case of a mistake, it's easy to return the card back into the stock and make any corrections with your course in real-time.&#xD;&#xA;1. When teaching kids, the process of making your own flash cards is a kind of a game. **Gamification** is a key technique teaching kids.&#xD;&#xA;1. Flash cards are confined to a **limited (rectangular) space**. Rectangular area of a vivid color is a great tool for keeping one's attention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having this said, we must realize that everybody is different. Some factor may work better or worse with a certain language student. However, the combination of all factors above make flash cards a really good tool for language acquisition." />

In many languages, the subject of a sentence is usually expressed by the nominative case, the direct object by the accusative case, and the indirect object by the dative case. In languages such as English, these functions are usually expressed by word order or by prepositions. Moreover, each preposition usually requires that the noun after it comes in a given case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, research about language learning suggests that a combination of conscious concentration on a particular grammatical structure and a not so concentrated exposure to that structure in a large amount of texts and audio materials leads to the best results.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When it comes to cases, conscious strategies might include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- memorising declension paradigms (such as German &quot;der Mann, des Mannes, dem Mann, den Mann&quot; for masculine singular),&#xD;&#xA;- reading a piece of text and concentrating on identifying which cases are used,&#xD;&#xA;- doing fill-in exercises,&#xD;&#xA;- memorising short sentences or phrases, such as &quot;der Mantel des Mannes&quot; 'the coat of the man'; &quot;Der Lehrer gibt den Mantel dem Mann&quot; 'The teacher gives the coat to the man.'; in this way, you are giving your brain bits of the language in the right context, which makes it much easier for your unconscious to create the right reflexes, and it also makes it much easier to retrieve the information later (the visual image associated with each of the phrases will effectively act as a mnemonic); in my experience, this becomes a highly effective strategy if a spaced repetition software is used for memorising the phrases/sentences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The less concentrated strategies might include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- reading a lot of texts, even if it is just beginner level texts in several different textbooks (as long as they contain all the cases that you want to learn),&#xD;&#xA;- listening to slow speech in the language you are learning (e.g., for some languages, radio news for learners are being produced),&#xD;&#xA;- trying to speak (ideally with native speakers) as much as you can, even with errors - quite often, people will repeat what you just said, but with the correct endings, just to make sure that they have understood you correctly." />

I think a combination of passive and active methods is most useful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; **1. Input**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Get lots of input, by reading a lot and listening a lot.  If you're trying to learn the rules of which adposition to use through a grammar or exercise book, you're understanding of the rules will not be deep - it will be technical, and you'll have difficulty seeing the subtleties that exist (grammar books often paint the differences between forms in black and white, when they are often quite gray).  When you get lots of input, you'll see adpositions used properly, and you'll learn a lot of the patterns subconsciously.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; **2. Notice patterns actively**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're getting lots of input, try to notice the patterns you see regarding the adpositions.  The patterns you notice yourself are often better learned than the patterns / rules explained in grammar books.  When you do this, remmeber that the patterns are not strict rules, and that there are often very subtle differences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**3. Get Feedback**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Try to get feedback regarding your usage of various adpositions.  Input is great, but some of the subtle differences can be very difficult to pick up on with input alone.  If you don't get any feedback, your mistakes will fossilize if you don't realize that you're making a mistake.  So you can try writing example sentences using various prepositions.  Try to use them in borderline cases where you're not exactly sure which one to use.  Ask a native speaker to give you feedback: which are definitely wrong, which sound unnatural or perhaps imply the wrong meaning, and which are correct.  If possible, ask a native speaker who is &quot;linguistically literate&quot; - someone who can explain why your mistakes are wrong.&#xD;&#xA;" />

If you said pavilion, then you are from somewhere else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The necessity of knowing all slang is not necessarily useful or even helpful. Learning a language is (or should be) primarily for communicating with another person or group of people. Some slang can hinder that communication if used with the wrong group.

Text="It is important to distinguish between [classifiers][1] and [measure words][2]. Though they are commonly referred to as synonyms, their uses are distinct. Some classifiers change the meaning of the noun they are attached to, and are not just for counting. I will use the word classifier as it encompasses your question better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Outside of that, let me use the example of Chinese to illustrate. Using the generic ge (个) for classifying nouns is what most Chinese (Taiwanese in my case) people recommend when beginning. This can be used for just about everything. As you start to learn what each classifier implies (本 for bound books, magazines, &amp;c; 张 for flat things like paper, newspaper, &amp;c.; 封 for letters and things within envelopes), you can add more classifiers to your common use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With that said, when learning basic nouns and noun categories, it is useful to learn the most common classifiers when learning nouns. However, many native speakers themselves may ignore the &quot;correct&quot; classifier to use the generic classifier if convenience serves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Classifiers are sometimes compared to grammatical gender of other languages (though they are not the same) because of the *classification* given to a class of nouns. However, they are distinct from gender because some nouns may fall into multiple classes whereas grammatical gender is an essential (and virtually unchanging) aspect of the noun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One benefit of learning the classifiers commonly associated with a noun group is that you do not need to go back to relearn them or learn additional ones. However, this is only a slight advantage as many classifier-using languages have intricacies in the usage of different classifiers and even native speakers may disagree on the &quot;proper&quot; usage. Waiting until you have a better understanding of the language will help you understand and grasp the proper use cases of the unusual classifiers. (I remember in my Advanced Chinese Linguistics class having an entire unit on classifiers and the teacher was offering a class the next semester solely on classifiers and modifiers in Chinese. So, this is a very involved subject.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This [list of Chinese Classifiers][3] may be useful for understanding classifiers in the Chinese language, though the principle of categorization of nouns is not unique to Chinese (or Afro-Asiatic Languages for that matter).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_classifier&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_word&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_classifiers" />

While learners of a second language can walk away from day one able to greet and bid farewell to native speakers, babies will take around a year of exposure before they form their first words.  Adults can learn sentence structure over a few weeks or months, babies and small children will take years.  If you consider a ten year old child speaking his or her native language and an adult who spent the last ten years completely immersed in the same language but learning it as his or her second, which do you think will be more fluent?  Even if the adult retains an accent, he or she will likely have a greater vocabulary and more knowledge about grammar and structure." />

Are you learning pronunciation passively by ear? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hereafter, abbreviate L2 for Second Language. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Step 1. Learn IPA.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why? Only IPA can empower you with:    &#xD;&#xA;1.1. independence (because you no longer need to rely on English to conjecture or guess how the L2 word should sound);            &#xD;&#xA;1.2. precision (because you know exactly to what sound some book is referring);    &#xD;&#xA;1.3. and universality (because you can use this to learn other languages, and to communicate precisely to other people (such as users here) which sound you mean).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example,  [Spanish.about.com](http://spanish.about.com/od/spanishpronunciation/a/b.htm) tries to describe how the letters 'b' and 'v' are pronounced in Spanish below; but its attempt appears ambiguous, and perchance even unhelpful to someone who does not know how 'b' and 'v' are pronounced even in English!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[1.4] The sound of the letters varies, however, depending on the sounds around them. Most of the time, the b and v are what are called voiced fricatives — in this case, a sound somewhat like the English &quot;v&quot; but with the two lips touching instead of the lower lip and upper teeth. Think of it something like the English &quot;b&quot; but quite a bit softer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Step 2. Read about [phonetics](http://italian.about.com/od/linguistics/a/aa072507a.htm).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why? See 4.2 below. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###3. How do you learn IPA and the basics of Phonetics?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These terms may look difficult; but not after you spend 5 minutes to read the following. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.1. For your debut, read the 2 chapters on Phonetics that also discusses IPA, in *[The Study of Language* 5th ed. (2014) by George Yule](http://www.amazon.com/The-Study-Language-George-Yule/dp/1107658179). This reading should take less than 1 hour. Easy, right?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.2. Then after 3.1, read the 2 chapters on Phonetics and Phonology in &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[*An Introduction to Language* 10th Ed. (2014) by V Fromkin et al.]( http://www.amazon.com/An-Introduction-Language-Victoria-Fromkin/dp/1133310680). Do NOT miss or neglect the IPA chart on p 2 (directly after the book cover). Instead, print it and keep it handy! I especially like this IPA chart because it lists and shows you where these strange IPA sounds can be found in English words (e.g. the IPA symbol [ʍ] equals the 'wh' in **wh**ich, and [w] equals the 'wh' in **w**itch). This reading should take less than 3 hours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.3. If 3.1 and 3.2 are not enough, then try http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Introduction-Phonetics-Textbooks-Linguistics/dp/0199246351. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;###Step 4. Read about [Italian phonology.](http://italian.about.com/od/linguistics/a/aa072507a.htm)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following quote should explain why even a basic study of phonology pertains to accents. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[4.1] What is phonology? According to Marina Nespor, Italian linguist and author of the book &quot;Fonologia,&quot; it is &quot;that branch of grammar that is occupied with the sounds that are systematically used in natural languages for communicating meanings.&quot; Put more simply, phonology studies the meanings of the sounds we make when we speak.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[4.2] One important fact to begin with, is the difference between phonology (fonologia) and phonetics (fonetica). Phonetics analyzes all sounds arising from human speech, regardless of the language or meaning. Phonology studies the sounds in context, searching for patterns by determining which sounds contain meaning, then explaining how these sounds are understood by a native speaker. So while phonetics studies how the letter &quot;f&quot; is produced (what parts of the mouth are used and how, in order to say an &quot;f&quot;) and how it is perceived, phonology analyzes how the words fa and va have different meanings, despite only differing by one sound.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Don't sweat it if you don't get it right the first, fifth, or fiftieth time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have the basics down, you should be good for a while.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Study the grammar academically&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just like in school. Get a textbook or study articles online. This isn't necessarily the most *fun*, but stick it out-- it *will* help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Do grammar exercises&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quiz yourself with simple sentences. Even working on the easiest stuff can help you with the most complex sentence structures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Immerse yourself in the language&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Grammar is **not** the most important part of learning a language. It's important, indeed, but not *the most* important. Ability to communicate in that language is the most important.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Specifically studying grammar may not be what helps you the most. Watch movies, read books, listen to music in your target language. Your brain will find the &quot;method to the madness&quot; eventually.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Don't be afraid to make mistakes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If someone asked you &quot;Yourself show me bathroom, please?&quot;, you would understand them, no? Is it proper grammar? Not quite, but it gets the point across, and that's what language is about, anyways: communication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're making mistakes in your grammar and don't realize it, that's OK. You might not sound quite right, but if your vocabulary is mostly there, you'll be communicating adequately. Once you do realize your mistakes, you're halfway to fixing them; as you familiarize yourself more with your target language, the grammar will come.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the end, the more you work at it, the better you'll get.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do *I* have perfect grammar skills even in *my own native language*? Nope. Will I ever? Probably not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I mentioned in [this answer][1], try changing up how you study: it'll give your brain a new challenge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://languagelearning.stackexchange.com/a/223/85" />

But for me, the sweet spot is about **15 new words a day**. If I’m focusing really hard for a short period, I can double that. Usually, though, I stick right to that 15-word range and enjoy steady long-term results. One of the most important things to keep in mind is that you rarely learn a vocabulary word the first time you see it, or even the first day you see it. You have to review a word again, and again, and again. I’ve seen estimates that say it takes seven meaningful exposures to really learn a word, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s closer to 20 or 30 exposures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I will save you a lot of my usual babbling and give you my personal opinion based on years of experience in foreign language learning right now: **30 minutes per day is the bare minimum**. This is the minimum that you need to actually make continuous, consistent progress. It won’t be very fast progress, but it will be consistent and continuous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both sources refer to learning Spanish, so really about 15 words a day, with 30 minute or more practice sessions. The first source suggests that learning less than 15 words daily could be too slow, while learning more than 50 words a day could cause you to not remember the words. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it's also a safe bet to say that this works for any other language other than Spanish. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.languagesurfer.com/2014/08/12/how-many-vocabulary-words-a-day-should-you-learn/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://howlearnspanish.com/2010/08/how-long-should-i-study/" />

For example, if I pronounced `&quot;lookathat&quot;` as pretty much one word, if you speak English, you will probably be able to distinguish it into &quot;look at that&quot;. This is because you can understand where the words begin and end.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A team led by Daniele Schön invented just six words: gimysi, mimosi, pogysi, pymiso, sipygy, and sysipi, and after seven minutes of listening to these words repeated in random order, student volunteers couldn’t distinguish between them. It took over 20 minutes for listeners to learn where one word started and the next one ended. &lt;sup&gt;[[1]][1]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following time, the volunteers were played music and they learned the word boundaries much quicker and better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![The image from the study](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/wp-content/blogs.dir/262/files/2012/04/i-0911601da2b7a814846cff8c9597c98f-schon1.gif)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can see the average accuracy is significantly increased when listening to music.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Memorization&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Music can also play a big role in aiding in memorization of words. &lt;sup&gt;[[2]][2]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How? When you need to think of what letter comes before `K`, you probably sing the alphabet song. This is because we can quickly associate a distinct tune with a unique set of memories directly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Because of music, we can memorize ungodly amounts of information without real effort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The source also provides steps to memorizing your own song which I'll put here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. **Count the number of syllables of your sentence.** In this case, “Un momento, por favor” has seven syllables.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. **Find a song or a nursery rhyme with the same number of syllables.** This step is the crucial one, so be sure to choose songs you’re really familiar with. For our example, the first line of the chorus from “Do-Re-Mi” fits perfectly: “Doe a deer, a female deer…”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. **Now swap the target phrase in place of the original lyrics, maintaining the melody.** So this time, you sing “Un mo-men-to por fa-vor” to the tune of “Do-Re-Mi.”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. **Repeat as often as possible.** This last step is another important one. You’ll find that it can sound a bit awkward at first. Don’t be discouraged and stick with it. Keep on singing until it stops being awkward. And when it stops being awkward, sing it around 30 more times.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[[2]][2]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2008/06/19/does-music-help-us-learn-langu/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.fluentu.com/blog/learning-language-through-music/" />

There's not much to understand. Sorry.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The usual tip when learning a language with (mostly) arbitrary grammatical gender like French or German is to **always learn the article with the noun**. When you learn the word for *car*, learn “la voiture” or “une voiture”. I think I the definite article is taught more often, but it has a downside of hiding the gender if the word starts with a vowel sound: better learn “un arbre” than “l'arbre”. Make sure you understand the pronunciation of the indefinite article though: “une arme” and “un arbre” only differ by the vowel sound (and the noun itself), since the E in *une* is silent and the N in *un* is sounded due to the *liaison* with the following vowel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nouns that specifically designate male people (or animals) are masculine. Ditto for females and feminine nouns. (There are a few exceptions with professions that are traditionally gendered.) These nouns usually come in pairs, e.g. “père/mère” (father/mother), “acteur/actrice” (actor/actress), “chat/chatte” (male/female cat). With such pairs, apart from a few common words, the male and female forms differ only by a suffix, the female suffix always ends with `-e`, and the suffixes mostly follow the same patterns as for adjectives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from that, you can't rely on the meaning of the word. Even if two nouns are synonyms, that doesn't make it more likely that they have the same gender.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can **sometimes** rely on the **ending** of the word. [Many word endings are strongly gendered](http://french.stackexchange.com/questions/2616/is-there-any-general-rule-to-determine-the-gender-of-a-noun-based-on-its-spellin/16781#16781). You may want to learn the most common ones, but I'm not convinced of the effectiveness of this approach: that's one more arbitrary classification to learn, and most classes have exceptions that you'd need to learn anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think (but I have no data or personal experience to support it) that it would be more effective to learn nouns on an individual basis. Once you know a critical mass of nouns, you can start looking for patterns: if you're unsure about the gender of a noun, try to think of a few words with the same ending; if they all have the same gender then chances are that the noun you're wondering about has the same gender.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What works better than endings is **suffixes**. Many suffixes have a single gender. If a word is built from a stem and a suffix, then once you recognize the suffix, you know the gender of the noun. For example, *-tion* is exclusively a feminine suffix, so any word built with that suffix is feminine, e.g. you don't need to learn words like *vasoconstriction* or *mobilisation* to know their gender. But there are a couple of words that just happen to end with those letters (e.g. *cation* is not *ca-* + *-tion*, *gestion* is not *ges-* + *-tion*), and they can be of either gender. (In this case, recognizing the suffix also tells you the pronunciation of the word: the suffix *-tion* is pronounced [sjɔ̃], but the letters “tion” are otherwise pronounced [tjɔ̃].)&#xD;&#xA;" />

(2007)**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887617707000224%20) come to the same conclusion as Bialystok and the other studies cited.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the reasons for this are not known, there are two competing theories:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Bilinguals, on average, use each language less often, and therefore reinforcement of different links is weaker in each language. [**Mindt et al. (2008)**](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11065-008-9069-7) touch on this hypothesis a little.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Bilinguals may have worse abilities to recall words because their L2 language may have been learned significantly later than their L1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that older studies believed that bilingualism caused a reduction in IQ (see e.g. [**Darcy (1953)**](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08856559.1953.10533654?journalCode=vzpg20)). However, these studies were flawed and are no longer accepted as accurate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There seems to be a consensus that bilingualism is, on the whole, an advantage, and various benefits are constantly touted. I'm not disputing those findings, but it's interesting to pay attention to the fact that there may be a bias *towards* studies that show that bilingualism is a positive thing, as [this *New Yorker* article says](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/bilingual-advantage-aging-brain) (the cited study is [**de Bruin et al. (2014)**](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/12/04/0956797614557866.abstract)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A relevant phenomenon is [code-switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching), when a multilingual switches between multiple languages in the same sentence or conversation. [The Linguistic Society of America says](http://www.linguisticsociety.org/sites/default/files/Bilingual_Child.pdf) that this is not an issue for children talking bilingually at home. However, it makes sense that it *could* be disorienting in a conversation with people who speak only one language. That said, this is not a likely common problem, nor a severe one," />

An advantage to this particular strategy is that if you have discipline-specific vocabulary you want to test, you can try to find a native speaker in that discipline to speak with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a native speaker isn't readily available, websites like [italki](https://www.italki.com/) offer 1-on-1 video lessons with native speakers around the world for a per-lesson fee. (That's not technically free, but it's not terribly expensive compared to traveling to a testing center.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to how to specifically estimate your proficiency level - ask the native speaker to quiz you on that level's description (note: I'm working off of [Wikipedia's descriptions of the CEFRL levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels) here).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example: the native speaker introduces him/her/zirself and asks you to do the same. You reply in kind. The native speaker asks you where you live - you reply. And so on. If the native speaker can follow you (and vice-versa), that's roughly A1 proficiency.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now you move on to discussing your day at work. You talk with the native speaker about your coworkers, about lunch, about the meeting you had. If the native speaker can follow you (and vice-versa), that's roughly B1 proficiency.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, this is a very rough measure, but if you can find a native speaker, it's free." />

Even when effectiveness is measured in more than one way, studies are unable to cover all of the possible benefits.  This is the reason that multiple studies and meta-studies are needed to make any useful comparison.  Actually, in the field of language learning, I don't believe many questions have been really thoroughly investigated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To give an example, if we are looking at the effectiveness of methods for learning vocabulary, there are so many ways they can be beneficial:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Are you learning the word for the first time, or strengthening knowledge of a partially-known word, or re-memorizing a forgotten word?&#xD;&#xA; - Does the technique build passive vocabulary (words you can understand) more or active vocabulary (words you can use)?&#xD;&#xA; - Does the method build understanding of how the word is used in context?  For example, what registers / domains it appears in, what collocations it is a part of, what specific meanings does it have.&#xD;&#xA; - Does it build receptive knowledge or productive knowledge, or both?&#xD;&#xA; - Does the method have a stronger impact on short-term or long-term memory?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So saying one method is superior to another is a difficult statement to justify.  Word cards might be good for learning words for the first time, while extensive reading might be more effective for giving a deeper understanding of the word.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it's important to keep this in mind when reading answers on this site.  Many questions ask for evidence from research, but in most cases the research will be too limited to make any definite conclusions.  An answer which cites peer-reviewed research may look good, but if it's a single study that's not very generalizable, it might be less useful than a detailed analysis based on experience.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Everything from grammar and syntax to vocabulary to non-verbal cues and beyond is essentially foreign. Though learning from books or other resources is okay, you are still limited to *your* understanding of what that particular resource is teaching you. If, for some reason or another, you misunderstand or misinterpret the grammar or other component of the language and continue to practice incorrectly, you will cement the *wrong* grammar, pronunciation, &amp;c. in your mind that will take much longer to correct at a later date.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When working with a native speaker, they will be able to correct you *immediately* so you do not learn incorrectly. They can help guide you through the nuances and connotations of the language so that you are less likely to mess up in conversation [&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/sup&gt;][1][&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#91;2&amp;#93;&lt;/sup&gt;][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So far, I have only addressed studying with a native speaker, when the native speaker is trying to aid in your language learning. This is a subset of conversing with a native speaker as they are trying to help you in your acquisition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When conversing with an L1 speaker, much of the responsibility for proper communication and learning relies on the L2 speaker. There are many proposed frameworks for this, but none have been accepted as *&quot;the answer&quot;*. Though not *technically* a language learning concept, self-confidence is crucial to pursuing language acquisition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One theme found in many frameworks (see [*Strategies in Learning and Using a Second Language*][3]) is the concept of self-awareness in language use. Other important themes related to this are active corrective listening, the use of circumlocution, speech mimicking, mirroring, and summarization, grouping, deduction, imagery, elaboration, inference, recombination, and translation. (A more complete list can be found in *Strategies*, p. 76.) I will only discuss a few of these.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;**Active Corrective Listening**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When unsure of how to say a particular phrase, rather than not speak at all, speak as best as you can generate the sentence, and then listen to the L1 speaker. Often, native speakers will repeat back part of the sentence with the corrected grammar as a way to ensure that they understood what was communicated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, in Chinese, if you wanted to asked if someone wanted to go with you to the movies, you would say (this is a gloss) &quot;You want not-want with me go watch movies?&quot; English speakers would place the &quot;with me&quot; part of the sentence at the end if asking this in English. However this is incorrect in Chinese. So, if the L2 speaker asked (incorrectly) &quot;You want not-want go watch movies with me?&quot;, the L1 speaker would commonly respond with something like, &quot;Yes, I want with you go watch movies.&quot; which uses the proper way to incorporate &quot;with (somebody)&quot; into the sentence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Observing the corrections that the native speaker inserts into his/her responses and *immediately* incorporating them into your speech (ie. responding with something like, &quot;Great! I'm happy you want with me go watch movies!&quot;) reinforces the proper usage and improves comprehension.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;**Summarization**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When communicating with a native speaker, occasionally summarizing the conversation provides feedback to check understanding.

When you do not know a word or phrase or are unsure of a word usage, you can &quot;talk around&quot; the word or phrase and allow the native speaker to provide the word you are looking for, or to verify your word usage. Even among native speakers, this is what most people do when the word or phrase is on &quot;the tip of their tongue&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Overall, *when* to start conversing with a native speaker is not as important as *how* to start conversing with a native speaker. I have had experience in this regard. I spent 11 weeks learning Chinese, and then got immersed completely when I flew to Taiwan for two years to converse with strangers about anything and everything. (I was a Mormon missionary.)

Unlike some approximations that are more subjective (ie. This languages *sounds* a lot like that language), linguistic distance is *quantifiable*. This is important because it gives a concrete comparison of two languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Using a statistical approach (called lexicostatistics) by comparing each language's mass of words, distances can be calculated between them. In technical terms, what is calculated is the [Levenshtein distance][2]. Based on this, one study compared both Afrikaans and West Frisian with Dutch to see which was closer to Dutch. It determined that the Dutch and Afrikaans (mutual distance of 20.9%) were considerably closer than Dutch and West Frisian (mutual distance of 34.2%).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another metric for comparison is through historical linguistic analysis. This is based on how close two languages are in derivation from some common ancestor and how long ago they diverged. This is less well defined and there are not many quantifiable ways to compare two languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_distance&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" />

One study observed that a group of random people who were exposed to Korean, Japanese, and Chinese for 30 minutes (both written and spoken) were able to distinguish between the languages when presented with them one week later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, many idioms and expressions come from poems or folk stories of that region and communicate a lot in a few words. For example, in English, we may say &quot;Well, it's better to reign in Hell.&quot; and many people will know the subsequent phrase from *Paradise Lost* of &quot;Than to serve in Heaven.&quot; Another example in Chinese, There is a famous poem that talks about procrastination, but most people will only quote the first one or two lines from the poem (明日复明日，明日何其多).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall, poetry will help you in your communication of a language because it is closely related the cultural experience of the people and they will connect to it and see you as caring about their culture as well as their language." />

The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; more common elements the closer they are. Mandarin and Cantonese are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; not mutually intelligible, but both have rich tonal systems, similar&#xD;&#xA;&gt; isolating grammars, and fairly simple phonological rules to map&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cognate words. Likewise French and Italian have a set of comparisons&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (similar conjugation/gender rules) and fairly regular rules mapping&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cognates. And the two sets of differences, those between&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Mandarin/Cantonese, and those between French/Spanish are of the same&#xD;&#xA;&gt; scale. The difference between French and German is so much larger than&#xD;&#xA;&gt; between Mandarin/Cantonese that one would be hard pressed to say they&#xD;&#xA;&gt; are of similar distance.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quantitatively, one can define distance mathematically, by collecting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a set of quantitative features in each language, and then defining a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; distance function that calculates an exact positive real number out of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a combination of all the differences of these features. Then one can&#xD;&#xA;&gt; do a simple numerical comparison, the distance between X and Y and the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; distance between Z and W. One can go further and use a clustering&#xD;&#xA;&gt; algorithm to create a formal family tree of all languages of concern.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Presumably, the utility of a distance function would be to predict the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; difficulty in language learning or translation (machine or human); the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; further the distance, the more changes would need to be navigated. At&#xD;&#xA;&gt; some point, a distance will be meaningless; the difference between&#xD;&#xA;&gt; French and Swahili is just too much to settle qualitatively or quantitatively to then bother comparing with some other distance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternatively, [this scientific report][2] suggests that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The distance between two languages may also depend on whether it is in the&#xD;&#xA;written or spoken form. For example, the written form of Chinese does not vary among&#xD;&#xA;the regions of China, but the spoken languages differ sharply. Alternatively, two&#xD;&#xA;languages that may be close in the spoken form may differ more sharply in the written&#xD;&#xA;form (for example, if they use different alphabets, as in the case of German and Yiddish).&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps the way to address the distance between languages is not through&#xD;&#xA;language trees which trace the evolution of languages, but by asking a simpler question:&#xD;&#xA;How difficult is it for individuals who know language A to learn languages B1 through&#xD;&#xA;Bi, where there are i other languages. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If it is more difficult to learn language B1, than it is to learn&#xD;&#xA;&gt; language B2, it can be said that language B1 is more “distant” from A&#xD;&#xA;&gt; than language B2. Language B3 may be as difficult to learn as is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; language B1 for a language A speaker, but that does not mean that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; language B3 is close to language B1. Indeed, it may be further from B1&#xD;&#xA;&gt; than it is from A. Alternatively, if the issue is the adjustment of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; immigrants speaking languages B1 through Bi in the linguistic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; destination A, one would want to know how difficult it is for speakers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of B1 through Bi to learn language A.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are [two][3] [images][4] of the table that shows the linguistic proximity between languages according to the study. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/1206/do-linguists-measure-the-relation-distance-between-languages-how&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://ftp.iza.org/dp1246.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://imgur.com/09q619H&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://imgur.com/kIrmNOS" />

The TOPIK contains no Hanja, so it's possible to get the highest level without studying Hanja.  Also, many Koreans, especially younger ones, don't know Hanja very well.  Even if they've studied them in school, they often don't retain them, because their use just isn't very widespread anymore - even in newspapers their use is very limited.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are some benefits to learning Hanja though, and depending on personal needs, you may want to learn just a few or learn them more thoroughly.  Some benefits are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. There are a few Hanja which are used by themselves quite frequently, often in public places, posters, newspapers, in graphic design, etc.  They're almost used the same way that symbols are used in other languages.  Examples are 大, 中, 小 (large, medium, small - used in menus, etc.), 男, 女 (male and female), 美, 英, 日 (used to represent America, UK and Japan in newspapers), etc.&#xD;&#xA; 2. A very large portion of Korean words are derived from Hanja, so knowing what they mean is very helpful for learning words (including ones that don't appear in the dictionary).  You don't actually need to learn what the Hanja look like, as long as you know the meanings associated with each Hangeul character; but often there are many Hanja associated with a single Hangeul syllable.  For example, 시 has dozens of Hanja, several of which are common: 時(time), 市(city), 施(do/act), 詩(poem), 始(start), 示(show), etc.  Knowing Hanja can help keep these different meanings straight. &#xD;&#xA; 3. Also, Hanja are used to separate homonyms in the dictionary, so knowing them can help when using the dictionary too.&#xD;&#xA; 4. If you are interested in visual arts, learning how to draw the Hanja then how to paint the Hanja can be fun.  It's always beneficial to connect your interests to your language learning, so if you enjoy that kind of thing, learning to paint Hanja the traditional way can be a motivating way to connect your interest in visual arts with your language learning.&#xD;&#xA; 5. If you are going into certain academic fields, there are some fields where they are still used for technical words.  For example, in my Semantics textbook, Hanja were common.  I believe there are still non-linguistic fields that use them too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, you shouldn't feel you have to learn Hanja, as they are not strictly necessary for most people.  But if you want to learn them, there are certainly benefits. &#xD;&#xA;" />

Spoken language arises in the mind but must be performed through complex sequences of breath control and voice shaping muscle movements. Furthermore, nobody speaks in such a way that every other person can comprehend them; for example, in loud dance hall environments, it becomes difficult to understand someone from the sound alone. But any sound is being produced by physical movement, so we can get a grasp on the goal utterance by observing earlier in the phonological chain, the observable movements themselves. Furthermore, it is understandable, through such experiments as reveal the McGurk effect, that the observation of the speech movements does indeed comprise a significant portion of the mechanism for speech understanding. A ballpark figure might be: 70% of speech understanding is audio, 15% from observation of the speech production, and the remainder from context and body language. These figures will of course vary from many various factors, relative to the mode of communication (telephone, face-to-face,  etc.), speaker, listener, environment, and topic of conversation. To observe the manner of pronunciation would thus lend itself to performing in a similar manner oneself. " />

(Yes, some may argue that the IPA is a list of distinctive sounds that occur in natural language, but there is a ***huge*** section of diacritics that alter how those sounds are made.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is an important concept in language (whether learning, using, creating, &amp;.) that morphs our pronunciation. It is called [*Coarticulation*][1]. There are two main kinds of coarticulation: *anticipatory* and *carryover/perseverative*. This is something that we cannot escape from in language. The central concept behind coarticulation is that we cannot isolate individual sounds from their environments. We either prepare for the next sounds (*anticipatory*) or characteristics of one sound are carried over to the next (*perseverative*).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Anticipatory Coarticulation**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The sounds that precede another sound (usually a consonant) are affected by those following sounds (either in the same word or in the next word, known as liason). In this case, we prepare for the next sound by modifying the current sound. (One of my linguistics professors said this was the most common form of coarticulation, but I cannot remember the source he quoted.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An example. In English, take the words &quot;high&quot; and &quot;hue&quot;. Notice the position of your mouth when saying &quot;high&quot;. The initial /h/ is open and unobstructed because it is preparing for the open unrounded /ai/ that is to follow. But when you say &quot;hue&quot;, your tongue comes up to the top of your mouth and prepares for the /j/ (y-sound) that comes after it. Which one of these &quot;h&quot;s is the *real* &quot;h&quot;? They both are, but their pronunciation is affected by preparing for the subsequent sounds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Though English has one of the richest vowel systems (and its vowels contain the vowels of most other languages), it does not have all of the consonants that would change how those vowels are pronounced (advanced tongue root, retracted tongue root, centralized, &amp;c), nor does it have all the features of other languages that are *applied* to vowels or consonants (like breathy voice, creaky voice, rhoticity [English actually has this one], nasalization, more/less rounding, &amp;c.). This makes the topic of vowels and consonants very difficult across languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is ultimately wrong to only consider vowels and consonants as being &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;static&quot; because they change so much across cultures, regions, languages, and dialect. Fully embracing and learning to pronounce *all* of the &quot;vowels&quot; and &quot;consonants&quot; of a language will lead to you naturally utilizing coarticulation to morph the sound into the correct one. In Chinese, when I learned the palatalized and retroflexed consonants as well as the /y/ sound, I realized that I naturally started pronouncing the words better and the Taiwanese people noticed. So, learn the sounds independently, yes. But practice them together with other sounds and you will find it helps your overall pronunciation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarticulation" />

Two learners will rarely have exactly the same objectives and approach, so it is important that they discuss their goals and needs with each other, and then set about achieving them in their share of the tandem time.&#xD;&#xA;Tandem partners are both experts for their respective language and culture. Together they may choose to read aloud, discuss particular topics that interest them, correct mistakes, suggest improvements, practise conversations or undertake any number of other activities.&#xD;&#xA;One of the most important aspects for successful tandem learning is that the partners meet as often as possible. This helps learners to become familiar with the foreign language more quickly, increases learning frequency, and makes sure that they get plenty of practice.&#xD;&#xA;To make tandem sessions as interesting as possible for both partners, they should deal with topics that are of equal interest to both learners. In other words, it is important that tandem partners find shared interests to discuss. While goals may vary, tandem language learning itself should first and foremost be an enjoyable experience!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This passage provides a basic overview of what is **needed for a successful tandem learning session.** Thus, by working backwards, we may be able to find out why you had an unsatisfactory experience. Here are some possible reasons I can decipher from the quote above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Your partner may not have been upfront about their goals and objectives, and may not have asked about your own goals, so by generalizing, your partner did not cater to your own learning style/approach.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Your partner may not be extremely knowledgeable in their language or culture, even if they are a native speaker.&#xD;&#xA; 3. You may not have had consistent and regular meetings. Often consistency is the key to learning a new language. &#xD;&#xA; 4. You should be discussing topics that are interesting to both of you to prevent one of you falling asleep in the middle of the conversation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that although, I couldn't find many opinions on this, **tandem sessions are essentially just immersion techniques.** It may be possible to learn a language through only immersion, but if you want to expedite that process and also retain a better understanding of the language, studying and practicing regularly will go a long way. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.uni-due.de/international/sprachtandem/how_en.shtml" />

They took 20 monolingual (presumably English) speakers, 20 English-Mandarin speakers, and 20 English-Spanish speakers. They then introduced them to a completely unrelated constructed language. The bilinguals successfully remembered about twice as many words as the monolinguals. An article on a similar study can be found [here](http://newmedia-eng.haifa.ac.il/?p=4493), using Russian-Hebrew bilinguals and Hebrew monolinguals. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems reasonable that bilinguals would be more adept at learning a second language closely related to one of the languages they speak than an individual who only speaks one of the languages, but the study shows that this holds even in the case of an unrelated case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[**Sanz (2000)**](http://faculty.georgetown.edu/sanzc/Sanz2000.pdf) looked at 201 students (77 monolinguals and 124 bilinguals, knowing Catalan and Spanish) from roughly the same geographical and educational background (Jesuit schools in urban northern Spain). The students learned English via a combination of methods. The bilinguals outperformed the monolinguals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One more thing to consider is that one of the languages can act as a bridge to learning a third language. For example, if a person is fluent in languages X and Y, and Y is closely related to both X and Z but X and Z are not closely related, it will be easier for the person to learn Z than it would be for a person who is only fluent in X." />

Two learners will rarely have exactly the same objectives and approach, so it is important that they discuss their goals and needs with each other, and then set about achieving them in their share of the tandem time.&#xD;&#xA;Tandem partners are both experts for their respective language and culture. Together they may choose to read aloud, discuss particular topics that interest them, correct mistakes, suggest improvements, practise conversations or undertake any number of other activities.&#xD;&#xA;One of the most important aspects for successful tandem learning is that the partners meet as often as possible. This helps learners to become familiar with the foreign language more quickly, increases learning frequency, and makes sure that they get plenty of practice.&#xD;&#xA;To make tandem sessions as interesting as possible for both partners, they should deal with topics that are of equal interest to both learners. In other words, it is important that tandem partners find shared interests to discuss. While goals may vary, tandem language learning itself should first and foremost be an enjoyable experience!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This passage provides a basic overview of what is **needed for a successful tandem learning session.** Thus, by working backwards, we may be able to find out why you had an unsatisfactory experience. Here are some possible reasons I can decipher from the quote above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Your partner may not have been upfront about their goals and objectives, and may not have asked about your own goals, so by generalizing, your partner did not cater to your own learning style/approach.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Your partner may not be extremely knowledgeable in their language or culture, even if they are a native speaker.&#xD;&#xA; 3. You may not have had consistent and regular meetings. Often consistency is the key to learning a new language. &#xD;&#xA; 4. You should be discussing topics that are interesting to both of you to prevent one of you falling asleep in the middle of the conversation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that although, I couldn't find many opinions on this, **tandem sessions are essentially just immersion techniques.** It may be possible to learn a language through only immersion, but if you want to expedite that process and also retain a better understanding of the language, studying and practicing regularly will go a long way. &#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.uni-due.de/international/sprachtandem/how_en.shtml" />

The first time you come across a new card, you may have no idea what it means.  To aide with this, include pictures.  If you're using electronic flash cards, find images on Google Images. If you're using paper cards, draw a diagram, or glue a photo from a magazine (old style cut-and-paste).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now this approach may have a slight down-side.  If you successfully make this change, you may find after a while that *you don't know how to translate any more*.  I have this problem at times, since switching all of my flash cards to be 100% L2 (including the parts of speech, etc). But, for my purposes, this is a very small problem (as I'm rarely translating).

When I talk about &quot;There's no place like home&quot;, you instantly know that I am referring to *The Wizard of Oz* and I can convey a lot more to you in that little phrase, than trying to explain a whole lot about not being grateful for what you have until facing the possibility of never seeing it again. Movies are an integral part to the current cultural experience of a language and many common phrases may come from movies. Knowing these references may show that you understand more than just the spoken words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://falkvinge.net/2013/11/17/nsa-asked-linus-torvalds-to-install-backdoors-into-gnulinux/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/watching-movies-for-language-learning/" />

Make it interesting- songs and videos in the target language are a&#xD;&#xA;    great way to mix things up and keep things interesting.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Make friends with people in the target language. Talking with them can be a fun way to improve both speaking and listening. &#xD;&#xA; 6. You could also try a technique called shadowing. This technique involves listen to audio, then attempting to repeat it-- to &quot;shadow&quot; -- what you hear&#xD;&#xA; as quickly as you hear it. Personally, I've not found this to be of much help, but it is worth a try.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You said that &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I also can't see any improvement with this &quot;practice&quot; methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How are you assessing this? I think assessment is important because students often lose sight of where they have come from and where they are currently at. It is important to assess listening at the start of training and later at regular intervals, so that you have a realistic record of their development.  Hopefully the results will serve to motivate them, but if for whatever reason there is no noticeable improvement (over a reasonable length of time), it will be an indicator that you (the teacher) need to change the listening materials or methods a bit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, take every chance to listen. I found that my own listening improved the most back when I was commuting a lot. Since I wasn't doing anything anyway I just listened to language tapes during the trips. While active listening is best, most of the time I just passively listened to the tapes." />

Part of the problem is **pronunciation**. The grammar is **harder than German grammar, and there are almost no Latin-based words** in it. The vocabulary is quite **archaic**. Modern loans are typically translated into Icelandic equivalents rather than borrowed fully into Icelandic. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; There are four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive – as&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in German – and there are many exceptions to the case rules, or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “quirky case,” as it is called. In quirky case, case can be marked on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; verbs, prepositions and and adjectives. The **noun morphology system is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; highly irregular**. Articles can be postfixed and inflected and added to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the noun. **In fact, Icelandic in general is highly irregular, not just&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the nouns. Verbs are modified for tense, mood, person and number, as&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in many other IE languages** (this is almost gone from English). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There are up to ten tenses, but most of these are formed with auxiliaries as&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in English. Icelandic also modifies verbs for voice – active, passive&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and medial. Furthermore, there are four different kinds of verbs –&#xD;&#xA;&gt; strong, weak, reduplicating and irregular, with several conjugation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; categories in each division.  **Many verbs just have to be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; memorized. Adjectives decline in an astounding 130 different ways, but&#xD;&#xA;&gt; many of these forms are the same.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**TL;DR: Read the bolded text. Basically, Icelandic is an archaic and isolated languages with an immensely tricky pronunciation, as well as completely unfamiliar and irregular sentence structure, vocabulary, and grammar.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, though I suspect the fact that while Swedish and other Scandinavian languages influenced the development of modern English because the Vikings, who invaded the British Isles several times, were from Scandinavia, Iceland remained completely isolated from Britannia. Since Iceland had no influence over English, it seems logical that it would be more difficult than other Scandinavian languages. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://robertlindsay.wordpress.com/2009/12/01/more-on-the-hardest-languages-to-learn/" />

They think that giving up handwriting will affect how future generations learn to read. “Drawing each letter by hand substantially improves subsequent recognition,” Gentaz explains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Drawing each letter by hand improves our grasp of the alphabet because we really have a “body memory”, Gentaz adds. “Some people have difficulty reading again after a stroke. To help them remember the alphabet again, we ask them to trace the letters with their finger. Often it works, the gesture restoring the memory.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To shorten the above, writing can help people read and interpret the text faster, which is important in mastering any language. This also means writing words down will also help store these new words into our brains a lot faster. For those with difficulty, people were told to trace the letters and the memories were immediately restored, proof of the effectiveness of writing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this other [article][2], the written summary is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Writing by hand strengthens the learning process. When typing on a keyboard, this process may be impaired. Neurophysiologists have examined research which goes a long way in confirming the significance of these differences. When writing by hand, our brain receives feedback from our motor actions, together with the sensation of touching a pencil and paper. These kinds of feedback is significantly different from those we receive when touching and typing on a keyboard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, our actions used to write send feedback back to the brain, which is allows the brain to take in information faster, rather than the poor feedback sent from a keyboard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When writing by hand, the movements involved leave a motor memory in the sensorimotor part of the brain, which helps us recognise letters. This implies a connection between reading and writing, and suggests that the sensorimotor system plays a role in the process of visual recognition during reading, Mangen explains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And here, writing can also help with reading letters faster and word recognition speed. Visual recognition is critical in learning (and for reading) and writing helps improve these skills.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   [1]:https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/dec/16/cognitive-benefits-handwriting-decline-typing&#xD;&#xA;   [2]:https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110119095458.htm" />

Nevertheless, it is essential to mention at this point that the concept of the social importance of language choice should be applied with a dose of caution to the speech of children in general as they do not play the same role in society as adult speakers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;generally speakers are aware of the effect of their switch&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From [this document][2], citing `Myers-Scotton, C. 1993b. Social motivations for codeswitching. Evidence from Africa. Oxford: Clarendon Press`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This indicates that adult bilinguals are conscious of their language mixing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Others' thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the greatest ways to familiarize yourself with your target language is to *speak* it (and eventually *think* it).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From [this *not*-a-scientific-study][3]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;I won’t ever get tired of repeating the golden rule of my language learning advice: speak, speak, speak!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Speaking your target language will make your brain more used to it, and eventually you should be able to go into &quot;Polish mode&quot; or &quot;Spanish mode&quot; or &quot;*XYZ* mode&quot;. I can attest to this myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And [another *not*-a-scientific-study][4]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;When learning a new language, you'll start learning words from your first language and translat-ing them into the new one. After a time, you should adopt a strategy where you are thinking in the new language and no longer translating the language in this manner. If you are going to avoid mixing up your languages, you need to start thinking in the new language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being able to *think* in your target language will enforce the &quot;*XYZ* mode&quot; ever so much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#My thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You're aware of the problem-- *that's halfway to solving it.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Until your brain adjusts to having another language around, those mix-ups may not go away for a while. However, don't lose hope! It took me a little while to find actual scientific studies that I felt I could use: take that as an indication that **it's not too big of a problem**; it should go away once you achieve more familiarity with your target language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Familiarize yourself more with your target language and it won't be a problem for too much longer.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www2.hawaii.edu/~sford/research/mixing.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://soar.wichita.edu/bitstream/handle/10057/5051/t11060_Brezjanovic%20Shogren.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.fluentin3months.com/not-mix-up/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.omniglot.com/language/articles/howtoavoidmixinglanguages.htm" />

Actually, it is quite impossible to not to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this [article][1], it states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The link between foreign language learning and culture learning has been established by the linguists and anthropologists a long time ago. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages has concluded that through the study of other languages, students gain a knowledge and understanding of the cultures that use that language. Moreover, students cannot truly master the language until they have also mastered the cultural contexts in which the language occurs. Linguistic competence alone is not enough for learners of a language to be competent in that language. From simple, everyday things, like forms of address to appropriate ways of expressing disagreement, culture forms an integral part of the language learning curricula. In any case, in order for communication to be successful, language use must be associated with other culturally appropriate behavior, not only linguistic rules in the narrow sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes that is a lot. But in short, the relationships between the culture and the actual language have been known for a very long time. By learning the language, students also learn about the cultures that use the language. So, by learning the culture, you can get a better understanding of the language and vice versa. It is practically a win-win. Culture can be used in your language anytime, from simple tasks to speaking with the leader of your country. Language should not only be used by itself, it should be slightly influenced by the appropriate culture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   [1]:http://www.afs.org/blog/icl/?p=3533" />

Two learners will rarely have exactly the same objectives and approach, so it is important that they discuss their goals and needs with each other, and then set about achieving them in their share of the tandem time.&#xD;&#xA;Tandem partners are both experts for their respective language and culture. Together they may choose to read aloud, discuss particular topics that interest them, correct mistakes, suggest improvements, practise conversations or undertake any number of other activities.&#xD;&#xA;One of the most important aspects for successful tandem learning is that the partners meet as often as possible. This helps learners to become familiar with the foreign language more quickly, increases learning frequency, and makes sure that they get plenty of practice.&#xD;&#xA;To make tandem sessions as interesting as possible for both partners, they should deal with topics that are of equal interest to both learners. In other words, it is important that tandem partners find shared interests to discuss. While goals may vary, tandem language learning itself should first and foremost be an enjoyable experience!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This passage provides a basic overview of what is **needed for a successful tandem learning session.** Thus, by working backwards, we may be able to find out why you had an unsatisfactory experience. Here are some possible reasons I can decipher from the quote above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Your partner may not have been upfront about their goals and objectives, and may not have asked about your own goals, so by generalizing, your partner did not cater to your own learning style/approach.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Your partner may not be extremely knowledgeable in their language or culture, even if they are a native speaker.&#xD;&#xA; 3. You may not have had consistent and regular meetings. Often consistency is the key to learning a new language. &#xD;&#xA; 4. You should be discussing topics that are interesting to both of you to prevent one of you falling asleep in the middle of the conversation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that although, I couldn't find many opinions on this, **tandem sessions are essentially just immersion techniques.** It may be possible to learn a language through only immersion, but if you want to expedite that process and also retain a better understanding of the language, studying and practicing regularly will go a long way. &#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.uni-due.de/international/sprachtandem/how_en.shtml" />

The study has interpreters put into a three month &quot;military boot camp&quot; for language learning and the results were amazing:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; After 90 days of intense training, the scientists, donning their spotless lab coats, came in and again measured their subjects’ brains. They discovered that their interpreters’ hippocampal regions, along with three other areas of the cortex, had grown significantly. The cortical areas increased in their thickness, indicating higher fire power for these areas of the brain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, learning multiple languages can also prevent/slow down Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Learning multiple languages at a time rather than one by one is seriously less time-consuming, especially if you want to be fluent in lots of different languages. It also saves time in life and in studying time:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Imaging that you’re travelling in South America and get lost while on the way to officiate a wedding. You’re standing at an actual crossroad and looking up at two signs. The left one says “Una Via“ (One Way), the one on the right says, “Camino Cerrado Delante“ (Road Closed Ahead). Can you imagine how much driving time you’d save simply knowing what those signs mean?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; One way is sequentially and the other is simultaneously. The methods are right in the names. Doing multiple languages at the same time (simultaneously) saves time because, in a way, you’re multitasking. Instead of getting fluent in one language in 1.5 years, you become fluent in 2 languages in 2 years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also take advantage of the differences and similarities between similar languages, such as the romance languages. For example, you can take care of the cognates between languages like French, Italian, and Spanish (arm, fever, and tongue after proper translation):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you notice, the spelling, meaning and pronunciation of these words (and many, many others) are similar for French, Italian and Spanish, indicating that they have a common etymology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Cognates are very useful for 2 major things... Vocabulary building... Contextualizing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You are not getting bored anytime soon. You might be watching Spanish shows one day then Japanese drama shows the next. Being bored will be the least of your problems if it is at all. You probably didn't know this: learning multiple languages can help you get employed, find that perfect dream guy/girl, and understand multiple different cultures:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Over the next decade, Spanish and Chinese speaking skills will be one of the most critical skills sought for by recruiters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As globalism surges forward, it makes learning multiple languages ever more essential. English isn’t enough anymore. A great number of international corporations aren’t based in English-speaking countries. In addition, US-based corporations are waking up to the fact that in order to flourish in the emerging markets, they have to learn how to say “Ni Hao” and not just “How are you?”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; On the romantic end, you’ll be ready to start a bilingual relationship. When your significant other has a different first language than you, what better way is there to express affection than learning romantic phrases in their native tongue? “Sorry” is just different when you say “lo siento.” And who knows, she might just forgive you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Though not really a credible source, another person's insight might prove valuable, like this [discussion on DuoLingo][3] (mainly the top reply):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It depends on the person. I will tell you my humble opinion, and tell how it works for me. For me, it is better to deal with multiple languages. For example, I'm learning three languages (Portuguese, Polish, German), and I'm doing well. If I have concentrated on only one language, of course I would progress faster on that language; however, concurrently learning multiple languages makes more improvement on your language knowledge in total, even if it may yield less for each language. Ah, let me explain you with an example: if I learn one language, I will proceed &quot;6 steps&quot; in that language everyday. Not bad. But if I learn two languages, I will move on &quot;4 steps&quot; everyday for each, so &quot;8 steps&quot; daily in total. And even more, if I learn three, I would get further &quot;3 steps&quot; for each, so makes &quot;9 steps&quot; in total. 9 &gt; 8 &gt; 6 . Therefore, the more languages I learn, the more total utility I get. This is my formula, and works well for me. It can be different for other people, of course.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I run an experiment myself. I found out that, I can learn and memorize an average maximum of 20 new words per day if I study just one language. On the other hand, when I learn words from two, three or four different languages, then this number can reach 35, or even 40 words in total, per day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Also, this is not so relevant to the topic, but just I want to tell because some people have already talked about it: I believe knowing a similar language makes easier to learn the other. For instance, speaking Spanish is a significant advantage for learning Portuguese. Yes, it can be confusing sometimes (Ex: I used to write “é” (the equivalent of Spanish “es” in Portuguese) while I was doing timed practice in Spanish), but after few mistakes, you get to know your mistakes and you don't do it again. And if you know the pattern, you can easily make a Portuguese word by its Spanish equivalent without knowing the Portuguese one, and it'll mostly be correct.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Or, if a person learnt Polish and knows well the seven cases of Polish, then, when that person starts learning German, the four cases of German will be “as easy as pie” for that person, meanwhile many people are struggling and whining about those cases.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Lastly, the more you learn languages, the more your capacity of learning languages increases and the more your brain distinguishes them, consequently you commit less clashes and confusions between languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So every person has his/her own efficient way of learning languages. Some people can learn one language in a short time, some can learn many languages at the same time. So just find the best way for you, and learn =)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, this [last, not-so-related article][4] quickly discusses some of the disadvantages of this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Until recently, I never felt the need to learn more than one language at a time. Now that I think about it, my strict “one language only” approach was mainly for three reasons: (1) I was never in a hurry to learn languages; (2) once I chose a language, I was so involved in the learning process that I had no desire to deal with others; and (3) learning only one language at a time gave me the opportunity to polish the ones I previously learned. Now, I’ll discuss these factors in detail.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For starters, rushing through the languages is not helpful. You are going to forget them and you waste all your time learning something you learned so fast it flew past your brain... ouch:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The first six months of the learning process are the most delicate, and one needs to focus on a given language daily and dedicate to it quality work. Time is a luxury that modern men lack, so if you split it between two, three, or even four different activities, the quality of your learning will suffer. Therefore, I personally recommend learning one language at a time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next, learning too many at a time will prevent you from having a steady core, which disallows you to have good fluency and quick differentiating of the languages you learned, adding to confusion and question marks:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The language learning process involves the use and memorization of words, structures, and sounds; however, emotions, colors, images, and memories are also involved and contribute to what I call a “language core.” Acquiring this language core is extremely important if one wants to keep the language alive in their head, even long after not having used it. Moreover, it takes time to build a language core, so attempting to speed through the learning process with multiple languages can cause language cores to overlap, or simply prevent even one from forming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The article also briefly discusses time management and a story to support it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Picking up a new language doesn’t prevent one from keeping and even refining the ones he previously learned and are obviously at a higher level. The trick is having good time management skills. By trial and error, you want to find a sustainable schedule to learn languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In order to better illustrate what I mean by “managing one’s time,” here’s a story I call “The Two Students’ Race.” Two students (both Italian) decide to compete for a challenging and ambitious goal: learning ten foreign languages. The judges give them a ten year “time budget,” and the rest is up to them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Student A decides that he will pick up two languages every two years. He starts by learning English and Spanish. At the end of the two years, he picks up French and German. While learning French and German, he enjoys conversing with native speakers in both English and Spanish, languages he now speaks with a certain level of fluency. He also loves reading books. By the end of the fourth year, he is relatively fluent in German and French, so he starts learning Portuguese and Swedish. At the same time, he moves to Pariswhere he gets the chance to use the four languages he learned and continue to actively learn Portuguese and Swedish. At the beginning of the sixth year, he decides to learn Mandarin and Romanian. Two years later, he finally picks up Japanese and Dutch. Then ten years later, when time is up, he speaks English, Spanish, French, and German fluently; Portuguese, Swedish, Mandarin and Romanian well; and Japanese and Dutch decently. He has weak languages, but he reached the admirable goal of building a core in more than five languages. Moreover, he will never forget these five languages. He could get rusty in them, but they will quickly come back to him. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Student B goes for the same languages, but opts for a completely different strategy—he starts learning the ten languages all at the same time. Over the years, he lacks the consistency and patience to hold onto all the languages he is learning. Sometimes he learns five, sometimes six or seven, but never ten per day. He might have brought some languages to a good level, but for the most part, his languages are at a basic level. He confuses languages such as Italian and Spanish, and Dutch and German. Many of his languages are destined to regress to a very basic level because the student did not build a linguistic core for any language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Now, the example is a bit extreme, but it gives you the general idea. People delude themselves into thinking that doing multiple things at the same time will accelerate the learning process when, in fact, it damages the learning process. Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare? Well, be the tortoise. Patience and aiming for a long-term goal will bring you success.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**TL;DR**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pros:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Good for your brain&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Saves time&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Differences and similarities will be easier to locate&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Being bored shall no longer exist&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Tons of opportunities are opened&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Learn faster&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Might rush through languages, lose knowledge&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Might not have a good core, disallowing fluency retention and fluency itself&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Might not be good for you time-wise &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   [1]:http://www.fluentu.com/blog/learning-multiple-languages-at-once/   &#xD;&#xA;   [2]:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912006581&#xD;&#xA;   [3]:https://www.duolingo.com/comment/593675 &#xD;&#xA;   [4]:http://polyglotclub.com/help/language-learning-tips/learn-several-languages-how" />

The Finnish speakers ended up using no articles or prepositions (as Finnish has no articles and few prepositions), while Swedish speakers (who have both articles and prepositions in their L1) did not have such problems (Jarvis and Pavlenko, 2008).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another study had Turkish, Yugoslav, Portuguese, Italian, Greek and Spanish speakers learning German - while none of them used articles from the get go, learners accustomed to articles in their L1 picked up the German articles quicker (Gilbert and Orlovic, 1975).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yet another study, which involved Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Spanish learners of English, found that &quot;although Spanish L1 learners’ acquisition order generally conforms to the “so-called” natural order (Krashen, 1977), native speakers of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese mostly acquire plural –s and articles later than, and possessive’s earlier than, is predicted by the natural order. This indicates that learners can acquire a grammatical morpheme later or earlier than predicted by the natural order, depending on the presence or absence of the equivalent category in their L1. This suggests that L1 transfer is much stronger than is portrayed in many SLA textbooks and that the role of L1 in morpheme acquisition must be reconsidered.&quot; ([Luk and Shirai, 2009][1])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, as a Polish/English native speaker, I can confirm that Polish learners of English have significant difficulties learning how to use English articles, as Polish has no comparable system - the nearest you can get to specifying or non-specifying something is by using variations on *some/this/that*. Most beginning and intermediate learners see them as tiny words with no meaning, since there is no simple way to translate that meaning into Polish. In fact, even Poles who are otherwise perfectly fluent speakers of English can once in a while stumble on which article to use: I've done plenty of proofreading where one of the only things I had to change was the articles...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you yourself haven't noticed this while learning English, there could be a few reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - perhaps Azeri, while lacking articles, has other structures that fulfill a similar role&#xD;&#xA; - Persian seems to have suffix-based articles, eg.

You depend on the language to survive—to buy groceries, to talk to employers and customers, to ask for directions, etc.  Being forced to use the language means you learn it even when you're not actively trying to.  It becomes a way of life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**You learn the language in more than one way.**  Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don't know a word, you simply can't communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you're trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own.  This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**You begin to think in the language.**  If you use the language enough you'll start to get good enough at it that you won't have time to think in your native language and translate.  Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs you read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say &quot;excuse me&quot; or ask for help.  Because you can't afford long delays, you'll begin to skip the translation step.  This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Culture reinforces language learning.**  When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language.  Your brain will retain the new knowledge and experiences you acquire better because it is different than what you are used to, and if the language is part of that cultural experience, you will remember it better.  For example, you might remember an idiom or a joke that only exists in the language you are learning.  This will expand your ability to communicate in that language." />

You are not exposed to natural sounding conversations and sentences (at least, not until very much later as you reach more advanced lessons). In this respect, Duolingo is in dramatic opposition to other language methods such as Assimil, Teach Yourself, or Berlitz. I don’t know how often you use the words “elephant”, “lion”, “snake”, or “horse” in your daily conversations with people, but no matter how useless you think this vocabulary is, you’ll have to go through the lessons that introduce it whether you like it or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. As stated above, because the program progresses in set stages and introduces vocabulary in what I call “boxes” (animals, food, jobs, furniture, etc.) rather than in a more natural fashion, the sentences you are exposed to, in a large number of early lessons, are essentially useless and at times nonsensical. For example, I’ve come across such sentences as: “My snake eats your cake,” “I have our cow,” “Their elephant drinks milk,” “The knife is in the boot,” “We come from the women,” and many more similar ones. Probably not the best arsenal of sentences to impress the native speakers on your next trip overseas…&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Duolingo has no natural sounding conversations, the stuff you would normally find in most good textbooks. Rather, you’ll only be exposed to short phrases/sentences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Duolingo uses a computerized voice system for all of its listening exercises, so you’re not introduced to how the language really sounds. The voice is dry, non-rhythmical, and well, it sounds like a computer. Because of this, I found the listening exercises quite useless, and you will simply not learn to speak or listen to the language correctly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. As stated above, Duolingo does not offer any explanation of grammatical structures as part of its platform.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.lingholic.com/duolingo-review/" />

But after that, there are diminishing returns: the next 1000 words gives you another 7.7% of a typical text, and the next 1000 words allows you to understand just 4.3% more.  After that, the returns on memorizing by frequency decrease even more, so learning from frequency lists becomes less useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that text coverage (the percentage of words that you know in an average text) is important.  We don't need to understand every single word in a text in order to understand the general meaning.  Some research has investigated what percentage of words we do need to understand. [Laufer and Sim(1985)][2] suggested 65-70% should be understood as an absolute minimum for comprehension, but [Laufer(1989)][3] (as described in [Hu and Nation(2000)][4]) suggests 95% should be known for solid comprehension.  [Hu and Nation (2000)][4] suggest that 98% of words should be known for unaided comprehension.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although learning high-frequency words is a good idea, especially when you first start learning a language, frequency is not the only consideration when choosing words to learn.  [Barker (2007)][5] suggests that &quot;cost&quot; and &quot;benefit&quot; be the primary considerations when choosing words to learn; benefit is partially defined by frequency, but also on personal needs.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it's good to learn the &quot;technical&quot; vocabulary of your major or field, and it's also useful to learn words related to your interest.  It's also beneficial to learn words with a lower &quot;cost&quot; - words that are familiar, that you've encountered a lot recently, or that just seem easy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, although memorizing words has benefits, it is best to combine this with real exposure to words, so that you learn them naturally in real contexts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/1997-Waring-Vocab_size.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://search.proquest.com/docview/1311690249?pq-origsite=gscholar&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=YxvT3TwAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=YxvT3TwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/2000-Hu-Density-and-comprehension.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X0700067X" />

This often happens in when children are brought up bilingually.  If children are exposed to two languages, but one is dominant - that is, they hear it a lot more than the other(s), they will tend to use this language.  If everyone can understand them when they use the dominant language, they will not see a need to learn to use the non-dominant language.  It is only with a lot of experience using the language that you can actually use it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, if a child grows up in English-dominant North America, but they have a grandmother that uses a heritage language, the child may never learn to speak that heritage language.

We have such vowel sounds occasionally in some English dialects, but they aren't considered significant (that is, if they are said non-nasally, they are not misunderstood), which is why most IPA transcriptions don't include the **/◌̃/** nasal sign.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One example is to compare the vowel sound in the word &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;add&lt;/i&gt;.  The word &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; has a nasal quality that &lt;i&gt;add&lt;/i&gt; does not (at least in General American).  But in American, this always happens before certain consonants (typically m and n). In French, Portuguese, and other languages, these sounds will happen in other parts of the word, which makes them seem difficult for native English speakers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One technique that can be used to nasalify (is that a word?) a vowel is, to practice it in conjunction with an **/n/** or **/m/**. In fact, in Portuguese, the nasal vowels are often even spelled this way (and I suppose probably evolved this way).  I suggest focusing your practice on **/m/**, because it is more nasal than **/n/** for the simple fact that your lips are closed, so the sound you produce with **/m/** is purely nasal, no matter what.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an example, to practice the **/ɛ̃/** sound (French &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;nde&lt;/i&gt;), find a familiar word (I'll use English examples, but if you're a native speaker of some other language, substitute your own) with the same vowel sound--ideally at the beginning of the word, because that's easier to isolate.  I'll use the English word &lt;i&gt;egg&lt;/i&gt;, pronounced, of course **/ɛɡ/**.  So now you know how to say the non-nasal **/ɛ/**.  Now add an m to the end.  Practice **/ɛm/**.  That sound you make between the beginning of your **/ɛ/** and the beginning of your **/m/** should now be the nasal **/ɛ̃/**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, vowel sounds (even the non-nasal varieties) vary between languages, so your nasal English **/ɛ̃/** may not be the same as a French nasal **/ɛ̃/** (and of course an English non-nasal **/ɛ/** is not the same as a French non-nasal **/ɛ/**, either!).  So this absolutely will not substitute for listening and speaking practice with a native French speaker.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But it can be a strong step in the right direction toward nasalizing your vowels.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Two learners will rarely have exactly the same objectives and approach, so it is important that they discuss their goals and needs with each other, and then set about achieving them in their share of the tandem time.&#xD;&#xA;Tandem partners are both experts for their respective language and culture. Together they may choose to read aloud, discuss particular topics that interest them, correct mistakes, suggest improvements, practise conversations or undertake any number of other activities.&#xD;&#xA;One of the most important aspects for successful tandem learning is that the partners meet as often as possible. This helps learners to become familiar with the foreign language more quickly, increases learning frequency, and makes sure that they get plenty of practice.&#xD;&#xA;To make tandem sessions as interesting as possible for both partners, they should deal with topics that are of equal interest to both learners. In other words, it is important that tandem partners find shared interests to discuss. While goals may vary, tandem language learning itself should first and foremost be an enjoyable experience!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This passage provides a basic overview of what is **needed for a successful tandem learning session.** Thus, by working backwards, we may be able to find out why you had an unsatisfactory experience. Here are some possible reasons I can decipher from the quote above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Your partner may not have been upfront about their goals and objectives, and may not have asked about your own goals, so by generalizing, your partner did not cater to your own learning style/approach.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Your partner may not be extremely knowledgeable in their language or culture, even if they are a native speaker.&#xD;&#xA; 3. You may not have had consistent and regular meetings. Often consistency is the key to learning a new language. &#xD;&#xA; 4. You should be discussing topics that are interesting to both of you to prevent one of you falling asleep in the middle of the conversation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that although, I couldn't find many opinions on this, **tandem sessions are essentially just immersion techniques.** It may be possible to learn a language through only immersion, but if you want to expedite that process and also retain a better understanding of the language, studying and practicing regularly will go a long way. &#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.uni-due.de/international/sprachtandem/how_en.shtml" />

So associating images with their respective word helps people learn the word faster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this [article][1], it states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A large body of research indicates that visual cues help us to better retrieve and remember information. The research outcomes on visual learning make complete sense when you consider that our brain is mainly an image processor (much of our sensory cortex is devoted to vision), not a word processor. In fact, the part of the brain used to process words is quite small in comparison to the part that processes visual images.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, your brain was built to remember images a lot more faster than words, which can take quite a while. For example, you might remember a restaurant's name after seeing its logo, which is taken in and stored by the brain as a visual. This type of association between images and words can help others retrieve the correct words faster. This also will help with retention and comprehension:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Based upon research outcomes, the effective use of visuals can decrease learning time, improve comprehension, enhance retrieval, and increase retention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is usually why lots of people are *visual* learners: because they learn by associating images with the correct terms and images are stored as memory faster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   [1]:https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/get-psyched/201207/learning-through-visuals " />

It gives her instant gratification when she gets something right and is useful in everyday life. Learning something that is useful is a great way to keep a student motivated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately I don't have a whiz bang magical way to improve listening. The best way is to just listen, listen, listen. I do have some pointers on how to approach it though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. If the student (your girlfriend) has a goal (in this case the TesDaF), find listening&#xD;&#xA;    resources that are relevant to that goal. Listening with relevant&#xD;&#xA;    vocabulary is important.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Make the listening activities useful and relevant to everyday life. Learning something that immediately benefits a student makes them feel good about themselves and can make learning fun.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Try not to make it too difficult. It's good to push a student, but&#xD;&#xA;    if is consistently too hard, it can demoralize and demotivate them.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Make it interesting - songs and videos in the target language are a&#xD;&#xA;    great way to mix things up and keep things interesting.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Make friends with people in the target language. Talking with them can be a fun way to improve both speaking and listening. &#xD;&#xA; 6. You could also try a technique called shadowing. This technique involves listen to audio, then attempting to repeat it-- to &quot;shadow&quot; -- what you hear&#xD;&#xA; as quickly as you hear it. Personally, I've not found this to be of much help, but it is worth a try.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You said that &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I also can't see any improvement with this &quot;practice&quot; methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How are you assessing this? I think assessment is important because students often lose sight of where they have come from and where they are currently at. It is important to assess listening at the start of training and later at regular intervals, so that you have a realistic record of their development.  Hopefully the results will serve to motivate them, but if for whatever reason there is no noticeable improvement (over a reasonable length of time), it will be an indicator that you (the teacher) need to change the listening materials or methods a bit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, take every chance to listen. I found that my own listening improved the most back when I was commuting a lot. Since I wasn't doing anything anyway I just listened to language tapes during the trips. While active listening is best, most of the time I just passively listened to the tapes." />

But after that, there are diminishing returns: the next 1000 words gives you another 7.7% of a typical text, and the next 1000 words allows you to understand just 4.3% more.  After that, the returns on memorizing by frequency decrease even more, so learning from frequency lists becomes less useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that text coverage (the percentage of words that you know in an average text) is important.  We don't need to understand every single word in a text in order to understand the general meaning.  Some research has investigated what percentage of words we do need to understand. [Laufer and Sim (1985)][2] suggested 65-70% should be understood as an absolute minimum for comprehension, but [Laufer (1989)][3] (as described in [Hu and Nation (2000)][4]) suggests 95% should be known for solid comprehension.  [Hu and Nation (2000)][4] suggest that 98% of words should be known for unaided comprehension.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although learning high-frequency words is a good idea, especially when you first start learning a language, frequency is not the only consideration when choosing words to learn.  [Barker (2007)][5] suggests that &quot;cost&quot; and &quot;benefit&quot; be the primary considerations when choosing words to learn; benefit is partially defined by frequency, but also on personal needs.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it's good to learn the &quot;technical&quot; vocabulary of your major or field, and it's also useful to learn words related to your interest.  It's also beneficial to learn words with a lower &quot;cost&quot; - words that are familiar, that you've encountered a lot recently, or that just seem easy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, although memorizing words has benefits, it is best to combine this with real exposure to words, so that you learn them naturally in real contexts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/1997-Waring-Vocab_size.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://search.proquest.com/docview/1311690249?pq-origsite=gscholar&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=YxvT3TwAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=YxvT3TwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/2000-Hu-Density-and-comprehension.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X0700067X" />

The procedure is quite close to as Roland Coeurjoly describes. It's a social sciences methodology emulating the &quot;scientific method&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. A hypothesis is made about some method -- say using colors to highlight some words in flash cards.&#xD;&#xA; 2. A procedure is drawn up.&#xD;&#xA; 3. A pilot test of the experimental procedure is run. (Depending on the format, you may or may not need to test both the experimental procedure and the control procedure).&#xD;&#xA; 4. A pretest in the relevant skill is given to assess language level in that particular skill.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Control group receives a standard teaching method or a time-wasting method. Experimental group receives the hypothetical method. Both methods should cover either the same content or content that is believed (due to prior research or some other reason for equivalency) to be of the same difficulty. &#xD;&#xA; 6. A post test is given to both groups to see how well they learned the material.&#xD;&#xA; 7. Spaced post tests may also be given depending on what is to be tested to see whether it stuck.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's several things that make it really hard to test effectiveness. First, there's no two people that are at exactly the same point in a foreign language. Second, any pretest is going to be a **proxy** for language knowledge rather than an exhaustive battery. For many of the projects I've read, it's a vocabulary test looking at how deep the students' knowledge of English vocabulary is. This proxy can't test whether the content is genuinely new to all learners. (One way to disqualify some is to exclude people who have lived abroad, etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third, not all material is equal even if it matches some criteria for difficulty. So in one (student-level) experiment, the student picked the word &quot;acorn&quot; and the word &quot;squirrel&quot; for a vocabulary acquisition exercise. These words are both infrequent enough in the English language that they are on the same frequency level with words Japanese college students don't know. But they basically ruined the test because students *do* know these words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fourth, the differences in effectiveness are often too small to detect on the sort of sample sizes I see. Part of the reason is that it's difficult to control someone's entire language learning experience. Another reason is that some things are painfully obvious -- if you don't require people to speak while learning a foreign language, many of them will be bad at speaking. Or if they never hear native input, they will have trouble listening to native speakers. But once we get past the painfully obvious, we're looking things that are *minutely* more or less effective. And when we do that individual variables get stronger (teacher's basic ability, student's eagerness to learn, etc.)" />

This makes me wonder if there is any good terminology to refer to the languages in the following type of situation, in the context of language learning:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- One language (let's call it *A* for now) is used in the household and in day-to-day conversations with friends and strangers.&#xD;&#xA;- Another language (let's call it *B*) is used either exclusively, or much more than *A*, in school, government, and the media. It is, to some degree, a prestige language where the person in question grows up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*A* is clearly an *L1*. Since exposure to *B* starts very young, is it an *L1*, too? Or an *L2* because becoming conversational in it happens at a later age than with *A* (for most children), usually in a school setting? Or is there better terminology for these?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some examples of this situation are Wolof and French in Senegal for native Wolof speakers, and Creole and Portuguese in Cape Verde or Guinea-Bissau for native Creole speakers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes to keep things simple (or attempt to improve their chances of being hired) people will just call *B* their &quot;native language&quot;. But that doesn't seem useful for talking about language acquisition for people in these situations, because *B* is not quite as native for them as *A*…and especially when you want to discuss teaching or learning *B*. In cases where the language *A* is a creole of *B*, there's the term [superstrate][1] for *B*, but I don't know if it's used for discussing language learning, or if it can be used when *A* isn't a proper creole.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(There are more complicated situations, too, such as where *A* is used in the household and with some friends, but there's another language, different from both *A* and *B*, that's used with most strangers in cities.

A lot of language learning / spaced repetition software (duolingo included, https://www.quora.com/Does-Luis-Von-Ahn-have-any-plans-for-optimizing-Duolingos-vocabulary-learning-using-spaced-repetition) tries to set up the learning intervals so that you revise items in the right interval, neither too soon nor too late.

It is a hard task, partly because users may not feel comfortable with whatever strategy is theoretically optimal (forgetting 10% of items may be too frustrating to many users).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing to consider is this: it has been hypothesized that one of the advantages of using spaced repetition is that you end up revising items from several different lessons.

Are you learning pronunciation passively by ear? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hereafter, abbreviate L2 for Second Language. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Step 1. Learn IPA.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why? Only IPA can empower you with:    &#xD;&#xA;1.1. independence (because you no longer need to rely on English to conjecture or guess how the L2 word should sound);            &#xD;&#xA;1.2. precision (because you know exactly to what sound some book is referring);    &#xD;&#xA;1.3. and universality (because you can use this to learn other languages, and to communicate precisely to other people (such as users here) which sound you mean).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example,  [Spanish.about.com](http://spanish.about.com/od/spanishpronunciation/a/b.htm) tries to describe how the letters 'b' and 'v' are pronounced in Spanish below; but its attempt appears ambiguous, and perchance even unhelpful to someone who does not know how 'b' and 'v' are pronounced even in English!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[1.4] The sound of the letters varies, however, depending on the sounds around them. Most of the time, the b and v are what are called voiced fricatives — in this case, a sound somewhat like the English &quot;v&quot; but with the two lips touching instead of the lower lip and upper teeth. Think of it something like the English &quot;b&quot; but quite a bit softer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Step 2. Read about [phonetics](http://italian.about.com/od/linguistics/a/aa072507a.htm).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why? See 4.2 below. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###3.

Read about [Italian phonology.](http://italian.about.com/od/linguistics/a/aa072507a.htm)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following quote should explain why even a basic study of phonology pertains to accents. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[4.1] What is phonology? According to Marina Nespor, Italian linguist and author of the book &quot;Fonologia,&quot; it is &quot;that branch of grammar that is occupied with the sounds that are systematically used in natural languages for communicating meanings.&quot; Put more simply, phonology studies the meanings of the sounds we make when we speak.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[4.2] One important fact to begin with, is the difference between phonology (fonologia) and phonetics (fonetica). Phonetics analyzes all sounds arising from human speech, regardless of the language or meaning. Phonology studies the sounds in context, searching for patterns by determining which sounds contain meaning, then explaining how these sounds are understood by a native speaker. So while phonetics studies how the letter &quot;f&quot; is produced (what parts of the mouth are used and how, in order to say an &quot;f&quot;) and how it is perceived, phonology analyzes how the words fa and va have different meanings, despite only differing by one sound.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Some knowledge about the writing system (Cuneiform was used for several unrelated languages, but knowledge of the writing system could be transferred). Same is true for Etruscan: It can be read (but not everything is understood).&#xD;&#xA; 4. Transcriptions of proper names into better-known languages help both on pronunciation and on deciphering an unknown writing system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ancient pronunciation is a difficult theme, and scholarly informed opinions on the pronunciation of Ancient Egyptian have changed considerably over time. Usually, the focus lies on understanding the Ancient texts, not in pronouncing them correctly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: Since Ancient Aramaic is a well documented language that is taught on universities (e.g., for students of Christian theology or Semitic languages), there are grammars, dictionaries and even teaching materials and courses available.  There is also the Bible in Aramaic language, a text with many local translations. This makes life much easier than the situation sketched above." />

Having to frequently switch back and forth between new languages keeps you alert and ultimately provokes you to be more proactive in the way you approach learning languages and organizing your time. And meeting the challenge of learning two languages at once head on isn’t just exhilarating in and of itself–it hones your language learning skills in a way that will make learning future languages faster and easier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If there’s one thing that sets successful language learners apart, it’s knowing that language learning is a skill that can be developed. And nothing makes you a better language learner than tackling two languages at the same time. If learning a language makes you better at everything down the road by making you a more flexible thinker, learning two languages at once makes you doubly better at everything by making your brain downright elastic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, this isn't the most credible source, but it seems legitimate and I couldn't find anything else. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.fluentu.com/blog/learning-two-languages-at-once/" />

When you look up a word, you only care about getting thing done, not caring about getting yourself immersed to the feeling of curiosity. Being curiosity is important, especially when you don't always use the language you learn. Even if you don't take the dictionaries down, when your eyes see it by chance, your brain will recall **your memory related with that language**. It can be about the country you have visited or a friend speaks that language, for example. Those memories are not directly help you improve the language, but it will help you to not forget it. You can think about the dictionary as a good ad, an ad not about a brand but about your memory. Or if you want your kids to get enthusiastic in learning the language, you can use the dictionary to &quot;activate their curiosity&quot;, either in a passive way (just put it where they can see it frequently), or in an active way (tell them some related thing that you know).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moreover, a definition in the digital dictionary is barely information lying in the screen, which is only perceived by your eyes. The paper dictionary can carry more characteristics that can be felt by other sensory senses: the weight, the texture, the smell of papers, the turning of the book, etc. You have to use other channels besides your eyes and fingers to perceive it. This again cannot help you understand the definition easier, but it can help you **strengthen your memory** once you know the definition. However, I would argue that the best way to remember a word is using it constantly, and the amount of information contained in an entry and in other sources that contain the word is probably more than what your senses can perceive when using the paper book. Nevertheless, those information cannot make the nostalgia feeling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The advantage of physical dictionaries is in these situations.

When a language learner can spend hours listening to&#xD;&#xA;   Icelandic pop, watching Icelandic TV and Movies, reading Icelandic&#xD;&#xA;   comics, then it is easier than a more analytic (i.e. without&#xD;&#xA;   conjugations and declensions) language. When specifically comparing&#xD;&#xA;   against other Scandinavian languages, the quantity of&#xD;&#xA;   language-learner pop culture material is comparable.&#xD;&#xA; - Icelandic uses transparent derivational morophology extensively. By this I mean you very frequently can guess a word's meaning from it's parts. In Swedish, like English, many of these parts have eroded down to where you can't recognize them. Goodbye used to be &quot;God be with you&quot;, &quot;varsågod&quot; AFAIK used to be a whole phrase too, I think the Icelandic equivalent is &quot;gerðu svo vel&quot; which is reasonably parsable.&#xD;&#xA; - Another factor is if the people prefer to speak to you in English or the language you are trying to learn. In some countries, it is difficult to get people to speak to you in your lousy (Swedish/Norwegian) when they could speak in English instead. Icelandic plays a big part in the cultural identity and on the continuum of preferences, Icelanders are more likely to prefer to speak to language learners in Icelandic. (Russians, I've notice, would rather talk to you in your bad Russian than in mutually good English, a very good situation for the language learner.)&#xD;&#xA; - Finally, it's a small language and the learners don't learn unless they are really motivated. This compares to the language learner community for French, which in the US is overrun by people with only a casual connection to it because they took it in high school. Being surrounded by highly motivated learners is a huge help with motivation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've got nothing to reference except a few years running an Icelandic study group/meetup." />

In fact, for the purpose of looking up a word solely, I believe that there is no way a physical dictionary is better than its digital counterpart. In fact, all of the reasons of the link you gave cannot buy me a thing, except the number 6:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The sheer density of knowledge held in your hands, in print, is an amazing feeling. The nostalgia of a big, paper book is also comforting and uplifting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An amazing feeling is definitely not what you care when you looking up the word. When you look up a word, you only care about getting thing done, not caring about getting yourself immersed to the feeling of curiosity. Being curiosity is important, especially when you don't always use the language you learn. Even if you don't take the dictionaries down, when your eyes see it by chance, your brain will recall **your memory related with that language**. It can be about the country you have visited or a friend speaks that language, for example. Those memories are not directly help you improve the language, but it will help you to not forget it. You can think about the dictionary as a good ad, an ad not about a brand but about your memory. Or if you want your kids to get enthusiastic in learning the language, you can use the dictionary to &quot;activate their curiosity&quot;, either in a passive way (just put it where they can see it frequently), or in an active way (tell them some related thing that you know).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moreover, a definition in the digital dictionary is barely information lying in the screen, which is only perceived by your eyes. The paper dictionary can carry more characteristics that can be felt by other sensory senses: the weight, the texture, the smell of papers, the turning of the book, etc. You have to use other channels besides your eyes and fingers to perceive it. This again cannot help you understand the definition easier, but it can help you **strengthen your memory** once you know the definition. However, I would argue that the best way to remember a word is using it constantly, and the amount of information contained in an entry and in other sources that contain the word is probably more than what your senses can perceive when using the paper book. Nevertheless, those information cannot make the nostalgia feeling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The advantage of physical dictionaries is in these situations. A digital book, not just dictionary, is very convenient and powerful when you need to get thing done, but it also means that it will be invisible when you don't need it. By contrast, a physical one is not that strong, but can help you to get motivated to do that thing. Getting motivated is a very important step to getting thing done." />

Besides the obvious portability advantages over both PC and paper based dictionaries, there are a few that I'd like to highlight according to my own experience while learning Chinese:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. No internet connection required: most of these applications are relatively small and have more words in their files than most paper dictionaries;&#xD;&#xA; 2. An Optical Character Recognizer (OCR) allows you to use the smartphone camera over any sequence of characters written in billboards/papers/screens to automatically present you the words involved;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Words combinations often result in different meanings: even several online dictionaries may not detect the associations.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Clipboard readers: if you are reading a website in your smartphone, you can just copy an entire text and by tapping words from the text in the application, small pop-ups are presented with the definitions without hiding the rest of the text.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Language usage examples: paper dictionaries normally lack of these and they are extremely useful for learning usage contexts.&#xD;&#xA; 6. Possibility of having multiple dictionaries and multilingual translations embedded in the same application: I often consult different dictionaries for one specific word in the same application, not only for providing more synonyms but for checking the contexts they might be used in.&#xD;&#xA; 7. Characters drawing: for non-Latin alphabet based languages, this allows you not only to memorize how you should write the character (strokes order, their dimensions and positions in the character) as well, with practice, it's much faster than typing them with the keyboard.&#xD;&#xA; 8. Speech recognition: if you are communicating with natives, this is a quick way to identify particular terms you are not familiar with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Answering your question: I used to know a librarian that seemed to have memorized every words' position in her paper dictionary, she would take less than 3 seconds to pinpoint any word you may ask of her.&#xD;&#xA;While this is an awesome skill (specially to watch being performed), it is only practically useful when your dictionary is among your study books on a desk... As [Ooker mentioned][1], this librarian developed an excellent memory for locating words, but in most cases, she needed to reread the definitions. You may take the same amount of time as her to find any word in a smartphone application and have better results from it, while saving money, time and the environment (paper = cut down trees), by opting not to buy paper dictionaries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unless you are in one of those rare schools that allows you to use a paper dictionary in a test (or in one of those more common schools that does not allow you to touch your smartphone in classes), comparatively, there are no advantages of using a paper dictionary over a good application.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://languagelearning.stackexchange.com/a/517/112" />

Two hundred case teachers reported that they teach in a flipped classroom and cited additional reasons for doing so, including the following: (8) there is more time to spend with students on authentic research; (9) students get more time working with scientific equipment that is only available in the classroom; (10) students who miss class for debate/sports/etc. can watch the lectures while on the road; (11) the method &quot;promotes thinking inside and outside of the classroom&quot;; **(12) students are more actively involved in the learning process; and (13) they also really like it**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Emphasis Mine&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and another:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ##From [Vodcasts and Active-Learning Exercises in a “Flipped Classroom” Model of a Renal Pharmacotherapy Module](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530058/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;**Conclusion**. Implementing a flipped classroom model to teach a renal pharmacotherapy module resulted in improved student performance and favorable student perceptions about the instructional approach. Some of the factors that may have contributed to students’ improved scores included: student mediated contact with the course material prior to classes, benchmark and formative assessments administered during the module, and the interactive class activities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The common trend so far is that students are more engaged in the topic and their perception of the curriculum is much better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ## From [The Flipped Classroom: A Course Redesign to Foster Learning and Engagement in a Health Professions School](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530058/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; As class attendance, students’ learning, and the perceived value of this model all increased following participation in the flipped classroom, the authors conclude that this approach warrants careful consideration as educators aim to enhance learning, improve outcomes, and fully equip students to address 21st-century health care needs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While all the feedback so far seems positive, there's a common trend here: ***They're university students***.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For university students, this seems like a good strategy, chances are they watch lectures online and study heavily in their spare time anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, for primary or secondary students, this isn't necessarily their style.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I was a kid, I can remember avoiding homework like the black plague.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Trying to teaching the core of someone's studies in an environment where they avoid it?

This means that, in a best-case scenario, a student learning to speak English by reading Tamil script will, in a **best-case scenario**, be learning 69% of the sound **incorrectly**. (Note this does not account for the relative frequency of any of the phenoms.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a more concrete example, I took your sample phrase, &quot;My name is Kolappan&quot;, and piped it through espeak to get the the IPA transcription in English:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  ma͡ɪ ne͡ɪm ɪz ˈkɑːlɐˌpæn&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I then did the same for your transcription &quot;மை நேம் இச் கோலப்பன்&quot;, and I got:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  ma͡ɪ neːm ˈit͡ʃ ˈkoːlʌppʌn&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now it's important to note that espeak's IPA transcriptions aren't always accurate, especially for certain languages, and its output is fine-tuned for its own speech algorithm, not for &quot;proper&quot; IPA output, but even so, you can see some distinct differences between the transcriptions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  ma͡ɪ n**e͡ɪ**m **ɪz** ˈk**ɑː**l**ɐˌ**p**æ**n  &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  ma͡ɪ n**eː**m **it͡ʃ** ˈk**oː**l**ʌ**p**pʌ**n&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With 14 distinct phenoms, only 8 are the same, or 57%, in this example. And some of the differences are incredibly distinct.  For instance, pronouncing [it͡ʃ] instead of [ɪz], is likely to be frequently misunderstood.  And the pronunciation of the name is drastically different, as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in summary: Transcription into one's native alphabet is a pretty poor way to learn a new language. If the goal is to avoid learning to read and write, a student would be much better of learning a new language by speaking and listening, without the use of transcription.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Even when the IPA symbol for sounds between two languages is identical, it doesn't necessarily mean the pronunciation between them is identical. And the variation gets even more complex when you account for different dialects." />

You essentially make sure that what you say is better said.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;High-school courses are often mandatory. As such, they know you won't leave if you are frustrated.

The idea is that you learn the grammar of the language and with a dictionary are then capable of translating primarily written materials into your language.  GT is primarily suited to reading ancient languages where the value of production is minimal and the point is to be able to decipher the text precisely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This was supplanted the **audio lingual** method. Here, you're going to be hearing and seeing a lot of things in the language and speaking, and you will be required to produce in that language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A further method is the &quot;Berlitz method&quot; or others like it which are all about immersion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More recently, there's also TBLT (Task-based language teaching), which is based on functional and situational use of language. There's also PPP (presentation, practice production), which says the instructor should demonstrate, then students practice, then students produce novel items.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's a lot of words. tldr: there are lots of theoretic approaches to language teaching. On a practical level, the differences are often (but not always) small. The proliferation of these methods is motivated by theoretical considerations about the nature of language learning. The reality is that language learning takes time and each method has advantages and disadvantages with respect to different goals. (E.g., I don't care if I can't say a single sentence in Latin (or for that matter Danish) since my goals are reading philosophical texts, but I care greatly if my Japanese is conversant and whether I can produce comprehensible e-mails and hopefully academic papers).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would doubt you had a pure GT approach in your high school. I would guess there some eclecticism in the teaching method used at your school. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, here in Japan, grammar translation (common but officially not allowed) is a crutch for instructors who themselves do not speak English to have something to say to their students where their knowledge is superior.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;If you want to read me Wikipedia has several good entries on language teaching/learning methods (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_pedagogy)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar%E2%80%93translation_method" />

This mainly depends on the methodology being used, certain aspects of the languages (fundamental differences, grammar, conjugations, and sentence structure) and your own unique learning abilities. It's much more efficient if you're already [bilingual][1] or trilingual, however if you're learning multiple languages at the same time for the first time, it could be really confusing, especially when one language interferes with another (this phenomenon is called [“interference”][2]). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interference can take place at all levels of the linguistic system, i.e. in phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and the lexicon. Here are few examples when it can occur:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- you learn a word, but without connotation or context,&#xD;&#xA;- you pronounce sounds the way you think they look in your first language (or English),&#xD;&#xA;- you create sentences using your primary language grammar syntax.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This may happens due to dual-task interference. One [study from 2009][3] shows that performing two tasks at the same time makes you worse at performing one or both of those tasks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Performing two tasks simultaneously often degrades performance of one or both tasks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in this theory, learning two languages at the same time could potentially degrade your performance in both languages, so it's probably perform best when you focus on one task at a time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It doesn't mean you can't learn multiple languages at the same time. It's possible to have great results, if:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- you don't mind progressing slowly,&#xD;&#xA;- you don't get bored easily with topics,&#xD;&#xA;- you don't get frustrated while learning,&#xD;&#xA;- you are motivated and love to learn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However if your goal is fluency, quick progress or ability to be good at one thing, rather than not bad at a lot of things, it's better if you focus on one language at a time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: [Can You Learn Multiple Languages at the Same Time?][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related books:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Crosslinguistic influence in language and cognition.

(Note: this does **not** mean that grammar study should dominate their learning.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, they'll be able to take advantage of the International Phonetic Alphabet more easily.  When they have trouble with certain sounds, they can look more closely at descriptions of the articulatory phonology of the language to help them make the sounds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These aren't big differences.

You essentially make sure that what you say is better said.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;High-school courses are often mandatory. As such, they know you won't leave if you are frustrated. So they can spend more time in teaching grammar, which is seen as a more academic (old?) approach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Online courses have other requirements. If the student faces a wall, they may get frustrated and lose interest or go somewhere else.

The idea is that you learn the grammar of the language and with a dictionary are then capable of translating primarily written materials into your language.  GT is primarily suited to reading ancient languages where the value of production is minimal and the point is to be able to decipher the text precisely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This was supplanted by the **audio lingual** method. Here, you're going to be hearing and seeing a lot of things in the language and speaking, and you will be required to produce in that language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A further method is the &quot;Berlitz method&quot; or others like it which are all about immersion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More recently, there's also TBLT (Task-based language teaching), which is based on functional and situational use of language. There's also PPP (presentation, practice production), which says the instructor should demonstrate, then students practice, then students produce novel items.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's a lot of words. tldr: there are lots of theoretic approaches to language teaching. On a practical level, the differences are often (but not always) small. The proliferation of these methods is motivated by theoretical considerations about the nature of language learning. The reality is that language learning takes time and each method has advantages and disadvantages with respect to different goals. (E.g., I don't care if I can't say a single sentence in Latin (or for that matter Danish) since my goals are reading philosophical texts, but I care greatly if my Japanese is conversant and whether I can produce comprehensible e-mails and hopefully academic papers).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would doubt you had a pure GT approach in your high school. I would guess there some eclecticism in the teaching method used at your school. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, here in Japan, grammar translation (common but officially not allowed) is a crutch for instructors who themselves do not speak English to have something to say to their students where their knowledge is superior.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;If you want to read me Wikipedia has several good entries on language teaching/learning methods (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_pedagogy)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar%E2%80%93translation_method" />

The study has interpreters put into a three month &quot;military boot camp&quot; for language learning and the results were amazing:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; After 90 days of intense training, the scientists, donning their spotless lab coats, came in and again measured their subjects’ brains. They discovered that their interpreters’ hippocampal regions, along with three other areas of the cortex, had grown significantly. The cortical areas increased in their thickness, indicating higher fire power for these areas of the brain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, learning multiple languages can also prevent/slow down Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Learning multiple languages at a time rather than one by one is seriously less time-consuming, especially if you want to be fluent in lots of different languages. It also saves time in life and in studying time:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Imaging that you’re travelling in South America and get lost while on the way to officiate a wedding. You’re standing at an actual crossroad and looking up at two signs. The left one says “Una Via“ (One Way), the one on the right says, “Camino Cerrado Delante“ (Road Closed Ahead). Can you imagine how much driving time you’d save simply knowing what those signs mean?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; One way is sequentially and the other is simultaneously. The methods are right in the names. Doing multiple languages at the same time (simultaneously) saves time because, in a way, you’re multitasking. Instead of getting fluent in one language in 1.5 years, you become fluent in 2 languages in 2 years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also take advantage of the differences and similarities between similar languages, such as the romance languages. For example, you can take care of the cognates between languages like French, Italian, and Spanish (arm, fever, and tongue after proper translation):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you notice, the spelling, meaning and pronunciation of these words (and many, many others) are similar for French, Italian and Spanish, indicating that they have a common etymology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Cognates are very useful for 2 major things... Vocabulary building... Contextualizing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You are not getting bored anytime soon. You might be watching Spanish shows one day then Japanese drama shows the next. Being bored will be the least of your problems if it is at all. You probably didn't know this: learning multiple languages can help you get employed, find that perfect dream guy/girl, and understand multiple different cultures:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Over the next decade, Spanish and Chinese speaking skills will be one of the most critical skills sought for by recruiters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As globalism surges forward, it makes learning multiple languages ever more essential. English isn’t enough anymore. A great number of international corporations aren’t based in English-speaking countries. In addition, US-based corporations are waking up to the fact that in order to flourish in the emerging markets, they have to learn how to say “Ni Hao” and not just “How are you?”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; On the romantic end, you’ll be ready to start a bilingual relationship. When your significant other has a different first language than you, what better way is there to express affection than learning romantic phrases in their native tongue? “Sorry” is just different when you say “lo siento.” And who knows, she might just forgive you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Though not really a credible source, another person's insight might prove valuable, like this [discussion on Duolingo][3] (mainly the top reply):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It depends on the person. I will tell you my humble opinion, and tell how it works for me. For me, it is better to deal with multiple languages. For example, I'm learning three languages (Portuguese, Polish, German), and I'm doing well. If I have concentrated on only one language, of course I would progress faster on that language; however, concurrently learning multiple languages makes more improvement on your language knowledge in total, even if it may yield less for each language. Ah, let me explain you with an example: if I learn one language, I will proceed &quot;6 steps&quot; in that language everyday. Not bad. But if I learn two languages, I will move on &quot;4 steps&quot; everyday for each, so &quot;8 steps&quot; daily in total. And even more, if I learn three, I would get further &quot;3 steps&quot; for each, so makes &quot;9 steps&quot; in total. 9 &gt; 8 &gt; 6 . Therefore, the more languages I learn, the more total utility I get. This is my formula, and works well for me. It can be different for other people, of course.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I run an experiment myself. I found out that, I can learn and memorize an average maximum of 20 new words per day if I study just one language. On the other hand, when I learn words from two, three or four different languages, then this number can reach 35, or even 40 words in total, per day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Also, this is not so relevant to the topic, but just I want to tell because some people have already talked about it: I believe knowing a similar language makes easier to learn the other. For instance, speaking Spanish is a significant advantage for learning Portuguese. Yes, it can be confusing sometimes (Ex: I used to write “é” (the equivalent of Spanish “es” in Portuguese) while I was doing timed practice in Spanish), but after few mistakes, you get to know your mistakes and you don't do it again. And if you know the pattern, you can easily make a Portuguese word by its Spanish equivalent without knowing the Portuguese one, and it'll mostly be correct.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Or, if a person learnt Polish and knows well the seven cases of Polish, then, when that person starts learning German, the four cases of German will be “as easy as pie” for that person, meanwhile many people are struggling and whining about those cases.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Lastly, the more you learn languages, the more your capacity of learning languages increases and the more your brain distinguishes them, consequently you commit less clashes and confusions between languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So every person has his/her own efficient way of learning languages. Some people can learn one language in a short time, some can learn many languages at the same time. So just find the best way for you, and learn =)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, this [last, not-so-related article][4] quickly discusses some of the disadvantages of this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Until recently, I never felt the need to learn more than one language at a time. Now that I think about it, my strict “one language only” approach was mainly for three reasons: (1) I was never in a hurry to learn languages; (2) once I chose a language, I was so involved in the learning process that I had no desire to deal with others; and (3) learning only one language at a time gave me the opportunity to polish the ones I previously learned. Now, I’ll discuss these factors in detail.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For starters, rushing through the languages is not helpful. You are going to forget them and you waste all your time learning something you learned so fast it flew past your brain... ouch:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The first six months of the learning process are the most delicate, and one needs to focus on a given language daily and dedicate to it quality work. Time is a luxury that modern men lack, so if you split it between two, three, or even four different activities, the quality of your learning will suffer. Therefore, I personally recommend learning one language at a time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next, learning too many at a time will prevent you from having a steady core, which disallows you to have good fluency and quick differentiating of the languages you learned, adding to confusion and question marks:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The language learning process involves the use and memorization of words, structures, and sounds; however, emotions, colors, images, and memories are also involved and contribute to what I call a “language core.” Acquiring this language core is extremely important if one wants to keep the language alive in their head, even long after not having used it. Moreover, it takes time to build a language core, so attempting to speed through the learning process with multiple languages can cause language cores to overlap, or simply prevent even one from forming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The article also briefly discusses time management and a story to support it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Picking up a new language doesn’t prevent one from keeping and even refining the ones he previously learned and are obviously at a higher level. The trick is having good time management skills. By trial and error, you want to find a sustainable schedule to learn languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In order to better illustrate what I mean by “managing one’s time,” here’s a story I call “The Two Students’ Race.” Two students (both Italian) decide to compete for a challenging and ambitious goal: learning ten foreign languages. The judges give them a ten year “time budget,” and the rest is up to them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Student A decides that he will pick up two languages every two years. He starts by learning English and Spanish. At the end of the two years, he picks up French and German. While learning French and German, he enjoys conversing with native speakers in both English and Spanish, languages he now speaks with a certain level of fluency. He also loves reading books. By the end of the fourth year, he is relatively fluent in German and French, so he starts learning Portuguese and Swedish. At the same time, he moves to Pariswhere he gets the chance to use the four languages he learned and continue to actively learn Portuguese and Swedish. At the beginning of the sixth year, he decides to learn Mandarin and Romanian. Two years later, he finally picks up Japanese and Dutch. Then ten years later, when time is up, he speaks English, Spanish, French, and German fluently; Portuguese, Swedish, Mandarin and Romanian well; and Japanese and Dutch decently. He has weak languages, but he reached the admirable goal of building a core in more than five languages. Moreover, he will never forget these five languages. He could get rusty in them, but they will quickly come back to him. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Student B goes for the same languages, but opts for a completely different strategy—he starts learning the ten languages all at the same time. Over the years, he lacks the consistency and patience to hold onto all the languages he is learning. Sometimes he learns five, sometimes six or seven, but never ten per day. He might have brought some languages to a good level, but for the most part, his languages are at a basic level. He confuses languages such as Italian and Spanish, and Dutch and German. Many of his languages are destined to regress to a very basic level because the student did not build a linguistic core for any language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Now, the example is a bit extreme, but it gives you the general idea. People delude themselves into thinking that doing multiple things at the same time will accelerate the learning process when, in fact, it damages the learning process. Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare? Well, be the tortoise. Patience and aiming for a long-term goal will bring you success.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**TL;DR**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pros:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Good for your brain&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Saves time&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Differences and similarities will be easier to locate&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Won't be bored&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Tons of opportunities are opened&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Learn faster&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Might rush through languages, lose knowledge&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Might not have a good core, disallowing fluency retention and fluency itself&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Might not be good for you time-wise &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   [1]:http://www.fluentu.com/blog/learning-multiple-languages-at-once/   &#xD;&#xA;   [2]:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912006581&#xD;&#xA;   [3]:https://www.duolingo.com/comment/593675 &#xD;&#xA;   [4]:http://polyglotclub.com/help/language-learning-tips/learn-several-languages-how" />

But the important question is where do you start having problems.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As information is lost, it becomes harder to distinguish sounds.  Actually, the auditory differences between two different sounds can be very subtle; humans who acquire a language are able to distinguish between two phonemes that really are very similar to each other from an acoustical perspective.&#xD;&#xA;This means that a low quality recording is *potentially* lacking in important phonemic information.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This may mean that the learner is unable to notice the difference between two similar phonemes in the language, or that they are unable to distinguish between a sound in their own language and the language they are learning.  For example, if they are learning Japanese, they may not distinguish between the English &quot;r&quot; and the Japanese &quot;r&quot; (actually a flap [ɾ]).  So they may just pronounce the sound as a sound in their own language, and this pronunciation could become fossilized.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, this will be most likely to happen if the learner is mostly learning pronunciation through one source, the cassette tapes.  My recommendation would be never to learn the language through the one source.  If at all possible, include some real interaction with native speakers in your language learning routine.  Then you'll be getting rich phonological input, and the interaction will provide an opportunity to get feedback about your pronunciation too." />

I now have trouble reading long sentences with the correct cadence, which I never had as a child.

It was my first time learning a foreign alphabet. I began the process long before the cognitive insults occurred.

I was one of the slowest readers (and learners of this skill) in my class, despite normal to superior performance in other, measurable aspects of cognition, i.e., a perfect SAT score. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I had no problem reading a transliteration out loud, but when it came to text in the foreign alphabet, even years of studying Russian did not help me get faster. I only finally learned to read aloud fluently in Russian when my Russian itself was fluent; by then, I knew the words and their contexts well enough that I didn't have to process letters individually anymore, and could basically read by guessing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Example #3 from my own history:*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The next alphabet I learned to read aloud was Hebrew.

Don't learn similar characters together.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to [interference theory][1] in Psychology, learning similar things together can cause those items to interfere with each other in your memory. So when you are shown, for example, &quot;天&quot;, you may recall the meaning of the similar item &quot;夫&quot; if you learned these items at the same time.  So avoid this as much as you can.  If a book you're using puts two similar ones together, delay learning one until later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; **2. Focus on distinguishing characteristics and use memory aids to distinguish them.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you notice two characters are very similar, learn one first.  when you learn the other, pay attention to what distinguishes them visually, and try to make an association with the distinguishing part.  For example, 犬 means dog and 太 means great.  So imagine the extra stroke in 犬 is the head of the dog, and you'll be able to remember the difference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; **3. Write the characters as you learn them.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't just learn the characters visually; learn to write them too.  Adding tactile information to your learning will aid your memory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; **4. Learn radicals and pronunciation components well.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Try to learn the meanings of radicals and the pronunciations of characters that are used as the pronunciation component of a lot of characters.  If you don't mix up the parts, you'll have less of a problem mixing up the whole.  I don't know Japanese Kanji, but I'll give an example from Korean Hanja.  If you know 古 is pronounced 'go', you won't mix up 若 (yak) and 苦 (go); it will be easily remembered that the second one is pronounced go, and the first one is not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_theory" />

Two heads are better than one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cons: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If you are speaking to each other in the language, you may learn each other's errors, or reinforce each other's errors, and these can fossilize.  This can be especially troublesome with &quot;calque errors&quot; - where you translate a phrase or grammar pattern literally.  You may not realize that native speakers of the language don't say it like that, so you keep using it.&#xD;&#xA; - You'll probably adopt a pronunciation based on the phonemes of your own language.  For example, if two English speakers are learning French, they may use the English rhotic sound [ɹ] instead of the French one [ʁ].  This can become fossilized.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the biggest disadvantage to both of these methods is the lack of interaction with fluent speakers.   If at all possible, it's best to get some interaction with fluent speakers (even if non-native).

If you for example learn all the parts of the body at an early stage, then you're forced to learn words like elbow and heel which are almost never used. This is demoralising since you are very likely to forget these rare words because there are so many other more common words vying for your attention, resulting in these words not being refreshed in your memory. Therefore you should just learn the most common parts of the body first. I would also say that with regard to fruit, learning apple, orange and banana is enough in the beginning unless there is a very common local fruit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, many very common words have lots of complex meanings associated with them. For example, lets say you've learned the word &quot;out&quot; in Engish.

If you for example learn all the parts of the body at an early stage, then you're forced to learn words like elbow and heel which are almost never used. This is demoralising since you are very likely to forget these rare words because there are so many other more common words vying for your attention, resulting in these words not being refreshed in your memory. Therefore you should just learn the most common parts of the body first. I would also say that with regard to fruit, learning apple, orange and banana is enough in the beginning unless there is a very common local fruit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, many very common words have lots of complex meanings associated with them. For example, lets say you've learned the word &quot;out&quot; in English - out is the opposite to in. Does that mean that you are going to  understand: &quot;get out&quot;, &quot;hand out&quot;, &quot;put out&quot;, &quot;knocked out&quot;, &quot;fill out&quot;, &quot;out and about&quot;, &quot;happy out&quot;, &quot;out of the question&quot;, &quot;out and out liar&quot;?

It can also be frustrating because of a perceived lack of progress, and time consuming, depending on the book.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, make sure you're reading something at your level.

This can be a great advantage, because of the typical richness of language in books as opposed to everyday speech.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Depending on the freedom afforded the translator, reading the same text in a different tongue can help you see it in a different light.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Re-reading a familiar text can become rote; add some diversity; definitely seek out variety.

I am much stronger in English than I am in Swedish. Sometimes when I speak English a Swedish word will randomly pop out of my mouth instead of the English equivalent. This is why I guess this happens. Take the word red, or röd as it is called in Swedish. In my brain somewhere I have an image of the color red with a connection to the audio for &quot;red&quot; and a connection to the audio for &quot;röd&quot;. When I speak English I follow the English paths in my brain but when I think of the color red, there is a risk that I end up taking a wrong turn to &quot;röd&quot; if the connection to &quot;röd&quot; is much stronger. Why might it be stronger? Well if I have been speaking a lot of Swedish, then there is a risk that I havet used &quot;red&quot; for a while so the connection gets a little rusty - it begins to fade. Connections in the brain do get weaker over time if we do not refresh them. This is so that the brain can forget old things that we no longer need.

For example, *Yo soy un hombre* may be good to start off with because it has the same structure as the equivalent English translation, *I am a man.*&#xD;&#xA; - Next, throw in some negatives in the sentences. Try *Yo no soy una mujer* and compare it to the English *I am not a woman.* Note that the negative word (not) comes before the verb in Spanish and after the verb in English. &#xD;&#xA; - Once you've mastered that, try some questions. A good example might be *¿(Tú) descansas?* while the English translation is *Did you rest?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you've done these basic tips, work out some sort of dialogue, perhaps between maybe a salesperson and a customer. Not only will this allow you to practice new vocabulary, you can also make sure you understand how to properly script questions, and it will also get you to use negatives in an answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'm sure that word order compared to English, sentence length, concrete versus abstract and idioms are all factors. I'd imagine a sentence like &quot;my house is big&quot; is good since it is very visual and therefore it will help me to connect words to pictures in my memory rather than to their English meanings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You would be right in that assumption. I find that material objects like animals, foods, and colors are far more simple to use in daily speech and writing and are much simpler to grasp. (*A side note: something that I've noticed when studying Spanish all this years is that it is most often the nonmaterial or abstract concepts that are used in idiomatic expressions.*) Like you said, it is much easier to visualize a concept before saying it, so start off with easily memorable objects in your life, then expand on to more complex, abstract vocabulary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally don't find sentence length to be a big deal as long as you know all or most of the vocabulary used in the sentence. However, the hardest idea to grasp in a foreign language is idiomatic expressions. For example, if you literally translated the sentences *Tengo quince años. También, tengo mucho hambre porque no comí.*, you would get something like *I have fifteen years. Also, I have much hunger because I did not eat.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Knowing Spanish idioms can help you simplify this to a more common form of English: *I am fifteen years old. Also, I am very hungry because I didn't eat.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; " />

Train yourself to become aware of your glottis and perform a glottal stop at will. You can train pronouncing 'uh-oh' and observing what happens between those syllabes. Also when coughing, you will close your glottis before the cough. You may also try to inhale air and try to stop the flow with your throat. Train youself to close your glottis without pronouncing any sound. With your glottis closed it should be impossible for you to inhale or exhale. So if you can put your glottis in a state where you can push a little with your lungs and not exhale any air, you are good.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Try with კ [k'] first. First: place your tongue as if you tried to pronouce an ordinary [k] sound. This should obstruct the airflow completely. Second: perform the glottal stop as you learned above. You can feel a little pressure building between your glottis and your tongue. Third: release your tongue without opening your glottis. You should hear the sound when the pressure built up is released.&#xD;&#xA; 3. When comfortable with the step-by-step method above try to perform this faster and with a vowel after the ejective sound. Or train some words containing ejective consonants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The method above allowed me to learn ejective sounds in a short time and two Georgian native speakers confirmed that I pronounce them correctly." />

I now have trouble reading long sentences with the correct cadence, which I never had as a child. I experienced certain cognitive insults in early adulthood which may go some way toward explaining this change, and I would like to learn how to remediate them if possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Example #2 from my own history:*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I began a third language, Russian, in young adulthood. It was my first time learning a foreign alphabet. I began the process long before the cognitive insults occurred. All the same--and despite my success with English--I was extremely slow in learning to read Russian (Cyrillic) text out loud fluently. I was one of the slowest readers (and learners of this skill) in my class, despite normal to superior performance in other, measurable aspects of cognition, i.e., a perfect SAT score. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I had no problem reading a transliteration out loud, but when it came to text in the foreign alphabet, even years of studying Russian did not help me get faster. I only finally learned to read aloud fluently in Russian when my Russian itself was fluent; by then, I knew the words and their contexts well enough that I didn't have to process letters individually anymore, and could basically read by guessing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Example #3 from my own history:*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The next alphabet I learned to read aloud was Hebrew. Despite several years of daily practice, to this day, I am painfully slow at reading Hebrew aloud. I attribute this to the fact that I do not have even an elementary knowledge of the Hebrew language, and thus cannot recognize patterns nor predict words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;BUT, I am studying another language--Yiddish--with the same alphabet, and I am almost as slow at reading that, despite the fact that I have a solid basic proficiency in Yiddish, unlike Hebrew. My Yiddish reading is slightly faster than my Hebrew, but not by much, even though the difference between my Yiddish knowledge and my Hebrew knowledge is significant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;....From what cognitive shortcoming am I suffering?" />

This becomes especially evident when we have limited time for thinking (e.g., verbal communication), unlike when we have enough of time (e.g., writing a homework).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What to do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Understand the problem. Read the core reasons why such words arise and how they can impact our learning process. In fact, the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend) is a good start.&#xD;&#xA;1. Since False Friends arise in our mind intuitively (in other words, besides our mind), the normal vocabulary learning techniques do not work in this case. I saw teachers who collect **humorous stories** about someone who mistakenly used the wrong word and got into an embarrassing or awkward situation because of that. When the students learned the stories, they automatically arise in our mind during the conversations in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I started studying English a zillion years ago, but I still remember many of these stories from my school times, like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In my language (Ukrainian), the word /magazin/ means &quot;shop&quot;, usually a food store. So the story is about someone who comes to England and wants to find a food store, but forgot the proper word, asked for /magazin/, so everyone offered them magazines instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This will also help struggling with (semi-) homonyms in the foreign language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Consider a story about someone who bought a ticket to a &quot;sheep&quot; instead of a &quot;ship&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are plenty of such stories available in the Internet, for every language.

If you know even a few dozen key grammar words you can begin to think in your target language thanks largely to the 80/20 rule in language learning.  It is easier than speaking in the language because you will not be embarrassed (unless you have a malicious alter-ego).  It requires less confidence but more motivation than speaking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; During the early stages you may be using more of your native language than your target language, and that is fine.  You will also probably be translating at first rather than “thinking fluently,” and that is fine, too.  What is important is that you make a conscious effort to use the target language in your thoughts, not just in your conversations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; To keep up motivation, I highly suggest a journal (digital or analog) that you keep with you at all times.  When you don’t know how to say (ahem, think) a key word just write it down.  At the end of the day look up the words, or even better, ask a native.  You now have a list of practical vocabulary to learn (instead of studying “shoelaces” and “aardvark” from a book)!  For extra credit, date each entry – you’ll begin to notice how much smaller your daily lists get (and how much more esoteric).  That’s progress you can see!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, keep in mind that our minds are built to match patterns and sequences, so if I am studying French flashcards and you suddenly talk to me, often my first reaction will be to speak in French - at least until the context shifts. A few other things you can try are to surround yourself with native speakers, visit the country where the language you are learning is prominently spoken, and change your phone/computer to the target language (recommended for more intermediate learners). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.fluentin3months.com/thinking/" />

First the proper names, spelled the same but with different pronunciations. Then words of the same Indo-European roots.

A key article is Louise Dabène's&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; [Comprendre les langues voisines: pour une didactique de l’intercompréhension][6].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wanted to place the concept before the &quot;how&quot; and now back to your language meetings. The group could agree on a topic they would like to discuss and each participant would prepare a few sentences in their own language, depending on length of meetings either on the spot or for next session&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.     &#xD;&#xA;When ready they speak up in turns in their own language. You must ask them to speak not too fast and to articulate, which is not that obvious to people who aren't used to speaking in public in a so to speak teaching situation.   Listeners are assigned two tasks :   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; -  Spot words they recognize or guess the meaning of. Words in a foreign language you don't speak can be recognized for various reasons. First the proper names, spelled the same but with different pronunciations. Then words of the same Indo-European roots. And the meaning of words can also be guessed because when we speak we make gestures, even unconsciously, and what we see is just as important as what we hear in comprehending speech&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&#xD;&#xA; - Spot at least one word they cannot guess the meaning of but would like to understand (you can tell them for example because they feel the meaning of that word is important for the global comprehension of what has been said), this calls on their aural capacity and memory.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Speeches&quot; should be prepared in writing for further reference in the course of the exercise but they should avoid reading the text. Listeners may take notes while listening if they wish.&#xD;&#xA;This type of activity can make people aware of all that is implied in communication and that multiple languages are not necessarily a barrier in comprehension but, on the contrary, can lead to personal and mutual enrichment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That is only a starter activity I am sure plenty more activities can be imagined as you go along. [Here's][7] an activity for kindergarten children that could be adapted for adults (in French).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Babylonia* is multilingual and articles are published in various languages, some in two languages, a few are in English, but German, Italian and French are the most frequent. So you can type &quot;intercomprehension&quot; and &quot;Interkomprehension&quot; in the search engine - some articles can only be bought. The whole of [this issue][8] deals with the subject of pluralistic approaches to languages and cultures. [This article][9] (available in German) deals with this website: [*Fremdsprachen sind nicht fremd!*][10]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; which is interesting for anyone who wants to know more about intercomprehension and offers a set of modules to help teachers work along this line. Available only in French and German.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This flyer][11] (in French only) from the French Department for Culture about multilingual approaches gives a nice example on how to work on a multilingual story - for young children but the idea can be adapted to adults.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Louise Dabène was a French researcher who pioneered work  on intercomprehension.  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Which could be a motivation to attend.  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Writing this I am fully aware of not including visually impaired people.

A typical 2-hour meeting would consist of (very informal) introductions, then we'd split the group into common languages. Typically there would be two or three groups of 2-5 speakers each. A German group, a Spanish group, and a Dutch group, for instance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Due to the lack of &quot;official&quot; languages, each week would have a different composition of speakers and groups.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the beginning of the year, participation has dropped drastically. Now we average 2-5 in attendance each week, and rarely enough to split into a second group. Most newcomers don't return.  Many repeat attendees return only every few weeks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm looking for suggestions on how to attract and retain attendees to such a group. What has worked for others?  Do we need more structure (perhaps by limiting ourselves to a few select languages)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I realize there can be many specific factors hurting us that aren't related to the content of our meetings, etc (publicity, location, schedule, etc). I'm not asking about these aspects. I'm assuming that if someone came once, then these things are not the reason they don't attend again. So I'm interested in reducing the number of people who come once, and never or rarely again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What has worked for you as a group organizer?  As a group attendee, what aspects enticed you to return? Which aspects pushed you away?" />

By age 10, she could understand us every time we discuss in English so we had to switch to Spanish when talking about her education.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My girl is now 16, she speak French fluently, very good English with a slight accent and Spanish enough to get along traveling. She also loves languages and has started to learn Chinese and Greek. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Your second question**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your child will not merge both languages. They easily adapt to different ways of communication. The brain of a child is a sponge for languages until age 5 or 6.

There is widespread belief that access to a native speaker can give you a significant boost with a foreign language. In my experience this is not the case — while it is definitely very useful, the efficiency is quite low, especially when the native speaker is _not_ an experienced professional teacher, and you both have a fallback language. Of course, a native speaker will provide you some exposure, but won't provide _enough_ exposure to cause a qualitative boost. A trip to a foreign country is way more efficient, since this is exactly the case when your survival depends on being able to communicate in that language. But again, the existence of a fallback language can &quot;ruin&quot; the experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This makes it quite difficult because there is no _one_ skill upon which to focus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming the wiki page is correct, you have a bit of guidance since there's a gap between the first and second portions.

Having taken many language classes myself I know that it can be scary to try and speak the new language. It is extremely important to make it clear that it's OK to make mistakes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way to get students to speak up is to use games as a regular part of the class. The students may get caught up in the game and forget to be nervous (I've seen it happen).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another method you could try would be to get them to learn English songs (e.g. they could each come to class with a pop song and then explain the lyrics). Poetry may work as well, depending on the ages and linguistic abilities of the students.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding the broken English: this is a problem which will only improve with practice and immersion. For most students it's better to speak a lot in broken English than to be paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. By immersing the students and introducing various inputs which include correct grammar (e.g. books, TV shows) you will probably help them eventually work out the correct way to speak and be understood. If this doesn't seem to be working you could try grammar-based games and assignments." />
